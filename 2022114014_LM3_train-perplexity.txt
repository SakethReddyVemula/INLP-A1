Title: Ulysses Author: James Joyce Release Date: December 27, 2001 [eBook #4300] [Most recently updated: December 27, 2019] Language: English Character set encoding: UTF-8 Produced by: Col Choat and David Widger *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES *** [Illustration] Ulysses by James Joyce Contents — I — [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] — II — [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] — III — [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] — I — [ 1 ] Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	4.038834453228597
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	9.354375132843046
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: —_Introibo ad altare Dei_.	10.022628739736925
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: —Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	18.782879540778094
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	10.787913291431142
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	13.590056125582102
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	13.082317352793753
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	23.22063162078846
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.	14.35885316824227
He added in a preacher’s tone: —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	13.791514571896577
Shut your eyes, gents.	19.435978688152108
One moment.	7.851822056789469
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	11.469341083222146
Silence, all.	9.843607963174879
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	11.634039141503058
Chrysostomos.	32.13581597679176
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	10.547030281649674
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	14.02091019504305
That will do nicely.	12.219458962182898
Switch off the current, will you?	8.218050038706359
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	12.911650966952838
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	6.189438981783939
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	5.6905613972382465
—The mockery of it! he said gaily.	17.17774688003216
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	12.383016429928784
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	12.228762985179966
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	18.39590643869821
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?	9.414089832988278
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	8.705251011363263
We must go to Athens.	27.47153934125334
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	8.810747826251934
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: —Will he come?	22.60169703306097
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	9.501449895180217
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	19.72937812271938
—Yes, my love?	32.316312579622135
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	19.78311017235144
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	12.653106487938542
—God, isn’t he dreadful?	18.799542510152595
he said frankly.	44.03155432905063
He thinks you’re not a gentleman.	9.441223396679236
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	9.664358743914773
Because he comes from Oxford.	24.60946982425277
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	25.42499626291462
He can’t make you out.	13.233832267114119
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.	30.514000900351284
He shaved warily over his chin.	11.33065710502632
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	10.028104088782417
Where is his guncase?	34.80086704566863
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	5.32016673304738
Were you in a funk?	36.76565972940926
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	12.638949306218343
Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	12.03959130503638
I’m not a hero, however.	13.827107278954717
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	31.878786789749814
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	8.124212718874963
—Scutter! he cried thickly.	11.175790050898943
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said: —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	13.328821106868599
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	13.819386817070322
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	12.089737026413149
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: —The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	13.712143131741982
You can almost taste it, can’t you?	14.01875640540074
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	13.434536713813277
—God! he said quietly.	13.947659567333519
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	20.596956274837616
The snotgreen sea.	5.95504205364476
The scrotumtightening sea.	5.95504205364476
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	14.786396833216765
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	33.40181911781661
You must read them in the original.	19.31999439027103
_Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.	10.162224931045655
Come and look.	17.225574683195212
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	13.166593877102466
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	15.969156318926531
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	5.065243053973324
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.	11.076552935767339
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	6.501073655185598
That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you.	9.204447547201806
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	25.009876097976413
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	14.872450755120612
I’m hyperborean as much as you.	10.908990105510805
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	10.874559123223877
And you refused.	19.289122266343515
There is something sinister in you....	5.548366444470281
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	7.0866617364823075
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	4.157229693800875
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	15.60736527463652
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	21.39949503876984
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.	13.569815555688367
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	11.371943699965973
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	6.779953215362319
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	9.364345398150451
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	9.195609331709957
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	14.556984653799997
—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice.	14.107328337464113
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	32.86612197738191
How are the secondhand breeks?	18.359662156380068
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	11.41329644203811
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.	16.98692510742101
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	16.858693394855624
Secondleg they should be.	10.554404256643833
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	6.6826152556093135
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	18.121795507406397
You’ll look spiffing in them.	9.489227019396525
I’m not joking, Kinch.	9.61027567692413
You look damn well when you’re dressed.	15.039462314226968
—Thanks, Stephen said.	4.6168437346026865
I can’t wear them if they are grey.	12.638027273425438
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	17.65665002210777
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.	12.032621374935601
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	6.762279856710714
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	14.887697516928966
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	33.6588945375876
p.	17.685021073205338
i.	32.13581597679176
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	12.822625352767608
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	10.15289447365196
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	12.013218734079302
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	8.221725932573145
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	9.504466830343377
Hair on end.	9.984191100479144
As he and others see me.	11.90208292349287
Who chose this face for me?	6.538745630257135
This dogsbody to rid of vermin.	7.907914236519451
It asks me too.	8.514509755641445
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.	12.654492063324177
It does her all right.	7.3059334230160085
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	5.625512374648339
Lead him not into temptation.	11.296873571782095
And her name is Ursula.	24.95748249297839
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.	17.56413270144845
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	8.860290119994431
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: —It is a symbol of Irish art.	11.690734915191573
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	8.591850270003613
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	16.409889440048445
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	12.102610768299222
he said kindly.	23.37726199077358
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	11.400952130520393
Parried again.	5.909382163877581
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	12.240734844870731
The cold steel pen.	16.33567991480922
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	13.30631707270977
He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman.	10.940332062422472
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	7.164463397519208
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	26.9403266223391
Hellenise it.	4.258023366747632
Cranly’s arm.	12.976952782873061
His arm.	12.429226669332564
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	13.248544276722889
I’m the only one that knows what you are.	20.17801387103311
Why don’t you trust me more?	12.399090174487785
What have you up your nose against me?	13.053251206359814
Is it Haines?	24.468378765106014
If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	9.500348514498635
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.	9.737067091110932
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	8.549006059421568
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears.	13.338142503018334
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.	8.754525311613664
I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	11.913540490743577
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	5.654356450416481
new paganism...	2.739065420347036
omphalos.	32.13581597679176
—Let him stay, Stephen said.	4.542925649210035
There’s nothing wrong with him except at night.	14.384071043254204
—Then what is it?	6.495948332185265
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	17.11666084987899
Cough it up.	4.908116716512725
I’m quite frank with you.	6.95433043987144
What have you against me now?	14.514278477684604
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	13.978338590674754
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	9.822168588694156
—Do you wish me to tell you?	18.385830119428082
—Yes, what is it?	8.453482298565943
Buck Mulligan answered.	10.0472061286583
I don’t remember anything.	7.639582425386718
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.	18.08909915076861
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	5.577036996745628
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?	24.805745673433435
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: —What?	12.26840890000176
Where?	14.036610527842967
I can’t remember anything.	7.386013880321848
I remember only ideas and sensations.	12.107345568102351
Why?	12.497976142926124
What happened in the name of God?	17.262696725572727
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	19.947040161771923
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	16.422404185726638
She asked you who was in your room.	32.39359423216341
—Yes?	25.13740288548873
What did I say?	21.010112394006637
I forget.	24.81632615462123
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead._ A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.	10.626421310968619
—Did I say that?	19.182062873619607
Well?	17.685021073205338
What harm is that?	7.545287656455477
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	9.883933432323873
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?	24.969809999812558
You saw only your mother die.	8.714440556726801
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	13.42942455836813
It’s a beastly thing and nothing else.	13.778890666945097
It simply doesn’t matter.	11.081541126080852
You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	14.608642748071764
Why?	12.497976142926124
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way.	14.903635259591729
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.	12.362924048149777
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	9.908297869167724
Humour her till it’s over.	11.324919287814392
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s.	7.983581956689778
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	14.381724804258244
I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	8.036282064005597
He had spoken himself into boldness.	13.052642310164256
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	21.07980473584426
—Of what then?	14.572036941433073
Buck Mulligan asked.	9.819963444641035
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	10.626851592513619
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	27.215197741019843
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	20.915627404856128
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	18.231514277167737
Sea and headland now grew dim.	6.14633179370776
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	14.149961677678203
A voice within the tower called loudly: —Are you up there, Mulligan?	22.327838039102815
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	9.488150822809821
He turned towards Stephen and said: —Look at the sea.	14.501818968422597
What does it care about offences?	18.752069898155586
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	17.621580718494677
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	6.14633179370776
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: —Don’t mope over it all day, he said.	14.309157341189461
I’m inconsequent.	24.08682475129976
Give up the moody brooding.	15.609339338240865
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love’s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	10.298100325135083
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	14.947946947565217
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	7.716472369757602
White breast of the dim sea.	15.000873277418235
The twining stresses, two by two.	5.94990065493008
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	4.525227685280991
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	6.262276127949248
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	14.49953742673495
Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	15.186591764712333
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	13.250739660833634
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	14.57784263120018
She was crying in her wretched bed.	14.512834717184596
For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.	19.522941929827624
Where now?	7.942397141020434
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	5.54609648382192
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	17.039975112592582
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	9.594487129663719
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	8.120448727366957
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys.	20.301577813136927
Memories beset his brooding brain.	5.483102864076354
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	20.547685170543783
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	11.929452633042258
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.	16.513663006204084
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	3.9143675583373017
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	14.552727482829667
On me alone.	10.133274831778289
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	7.316524124689606
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	10.11727554714152
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	6.965705920070913
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	26.49896152136875
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._ Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	6.758422364666659
—Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.	9.8493527826859
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	8.603831722029526
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	18.04133354803709
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	34.631993524953096
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	4.29836632193855
It’s all right.	5.592046872441169
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.	9.71037188325029
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	6.891626116404842
For my sake and for all our sakes.	21.02925083751907
His head disappeared and reappeared.	11.222753485290216
—I told him your symbol of Irish art.	13.005478996889986
He says it’s very clever.	15.468350476713622
Touch him for a quid, will you?	7.961711291550018
A guinea, I mean.	13.163960247514405
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	9.587394817245102
—The school kip?	26.25960533022616
How much?	15.28412872216335
Four quid?	12.599684944605478
Lend us one.	10.484022561268715
—If you want it, Stephen said.	8.129697439431174
We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	9.312260961815129
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	8.949652011548354
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won’t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won’t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	9.10418849663748
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	8.072239149356275
Why should I bring it down?	17.17786919522031
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	16.18901973182987
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	18.229135676125665
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	12.658058026598109
I am another now and yet the same.	19.443552259736204
A servant too.	4.387016086573923
A server of a servant.	14.935047453159562
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	10.76933431198535
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	10.503596993980079
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	4.654604494923057
Haines, open that door, will you?	7.026625873574793
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	14.129458556286693
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	17.28824660026884
—Have you the key?	14.315088497461176
a voice asked.	8.139974284576594
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	6.281636843745513
Janey Mack, I’m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: —Kinch! —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	15.49807629436211
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	9.740828886849936
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	12.616318670544915
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	7.367885066864577
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	12.173715185755746
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	11.766471267406331
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	8.096511095005107
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	11.140850543058987
The grub is ready.	6.186442684388578
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	25.86437357065693
Where’s the sugar?	25.100228703273505
O, jay, there’s no milk.	14.686504634137185
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	20.777317058117106
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	22.70554974835358
he said.	3.724527490343976
I told her to come after eight.	18.039173582446878
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	16.412275414740723
There’s a lemon in the locker.	24.83147782487281
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	6.390186908667816
I want Sandycove milk.	14.578692014088714
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly: —That woman is coming up with the milk.	27.982423752816924
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	21.69947243140683
Sit down.	7.866648935156897
Pour out the tea there.	9.14920935319541
The sugar is in the bag.	20.219611718428762
Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	16.852918857702065
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._ Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	9.13085818398404
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.	7.524108308242199
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?	16.268939105441095
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice: —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	18.377881952817546
And when I makes water I makes water.	11.507822676878542
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	9.068000425253127
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.	15.891338019832158
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot._ He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	10.055801907418527
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	21.545597897024003
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	10.917773805997633
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	20.19368116467767
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows: —Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?	19.85492003756001
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	32.24233864819559
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	27.882737722812315
Your reasons, pray?	17.009546616257122
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	23.751100728331995
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	21.04173837996317
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.	12.53009790561072
—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly.	13.791702903028
Do you think she was?	30.67625827749565
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _—For old Mary Ann She doesn’t care a damn.	14.3188374381236
But, hising up her petticoats..._ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	11.962363545942717
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	5.968415348102963
Kinch, get the jug.	45.98471033016545
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.	26.910629413416622
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	2.4580414401392043
Glory be to God.	6.95716652941755
—To whom?	25.49262508376742
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	12.104391407339838
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	21.818775919604082
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	13.77141750733724
—How much, sir?	21.62277956022868
asked the old woman.	16.927730991218983
—A quart, Stephen said.	7.6090971507171705
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	13.631644090012559
Old shrunken paps.	11.148858409578036
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	14.547502612465514
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	12.530567139349001
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	14.76610567654824
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	14.881791909288891
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	9.04256796631786
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	11.657901207477352
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	10.765842762921256
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	10.423565567744326
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	11.375534200164525
—Taste it, sir, she said.	1.1955876062430482
He drank at her bidding.	20.89216979122409
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	13.338856558504123
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.	8.433983590720686
—Are you a medical student, sir?	11.050359347397698
the old woman asked.	12.976253751950857
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.	8.165033027522497
—Look at that now, she said.	2.3204312821065267
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	6.236313947861035
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	14.385623275019189
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.	24.689046312129776
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	11.3725793920362
—Do you understand what he says?	30.953079821790876
Stephen asked her.	8.237517173289245
—Is it French you are talking, sir?	10.716691473912167
the old woman said to Haines.	14.220083223517916
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	13.336119392268909
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	5.551533926962829
Is there Gaelic on you?	6.808385524364878
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	6.815456287164303
Are you from the west, sir?	35.508814188767566
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	15.840159262809161
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	13.52398597094322
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself.	14.20147958006792
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.	17.0620064264342
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	21.55411830190582
Wonderful entirely.	16.58211792698403
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	10.741633185267208
Would you like a cup, ma’am?	14.41002149643933
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	13.081877971824898
Haines said to her: —Have you your bill?	32.22813783422469
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?	13.149090328590718
Stephen filled again the three cups.	16.06567989492702
—Bill, sir?	7.009560141623047
she said, halting.	35.51207824275101
Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling.	8.64170527073733
That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	13.434760533292144
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	11.662447664856746
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	3.3463217372371243
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	11.757950632141478
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: —A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: —Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	19.712531143363464
All I can give you I give.	21.5674300556076
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	10.465910699369804
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.	5.296432433293203
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	3.821514344242881
Time enough.	11.943845981129963
Good morning, sir.	3.744215129923402
She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant: _—Heart of my heart, were it more, More would be laid at your feet._ He turned to Stephen and said: —Seriously, Dedalus.	16.04397892256956
I’m stony.	24.08682475129976
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	8.791023329643258
Today the bards must drink and junket.	7.733956077402238
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	9.900770819217858
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	16.79621973454419
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	5.699664266699097
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	16.41927687170692
Then he said to Haines: —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	13.792669124141792
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	15.086101907666846
Speaking to me.	4.985604041519075
They wash and tub and scrub.	8.38613991257032
Agenbite of inwit.	7.496728605607897
Conscience.	32.13581597679176
Yet here’s a spot.	12.90635566718131
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	11.81312043412257
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	17.14993898182966
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	16.34676028978656
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	17.25530868555804
—Would I make any money by it?	7.285746307621941
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: —I don’t know, I’m sure.	14.071327850083785
He strolled out to the doorway.	16.13081497313115
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: —You put your hoof in it now.	9.901529991556098
What did you say that for?	21.86537193485889
—Well?	31.579380399266167
Stephen said.	4.142530577726673
The problem is to get money.	15.115601970832135
From whom?	11.725328032605423
From the milkwoman or from him.	7.698833548753367
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	14.386812109515647
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	16.099689760094442
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.	11.943837921484773
—From me, Kinch, he said.	9.397594070492655
In a suddenly changed tone he added: —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.	13.534341955227504
Damn all else they are good for.	14.64620919346826
Why don’t you play them as I do?	15.506090236196098
To hell with them all.	7.913419839145834
Let us get out of the kip.	24.305418196330738
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: —Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	14.395747472157364
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	7.156676636947912
—There’s your snotrag, he said.	5.785311736738395
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	16.88043203921023
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	15.499859518090618
God, we’ll simply have to dress the character.	12.69113700055613
I want puce gloves and green boots.	13.0252484844669
Contradiction.	32.13581597679176
Do I contradict myself?	9.910497547215114
Very well then, I contradict myself.	20.354867193349214
Mercurial Malachi.	16.688409521161915
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	6.978577587354654
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	12.30154314415281
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	13.992482418356786
Come out, Kinch.	22.495012129727524
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	9.951299395077912
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: —And going forth he met Butterly.	9.469585942758668
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	15.019212341946028
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	17.155684753133126
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: —Did you bring the key?	20.55844121540195
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	11.101377243830566
He walked on.	6.2943887622623915
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	13.291811450460553
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: —Do you pay rent for this tower?	14.88059556150248
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	3.3349693304117567
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	9.923119691105972
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	11.9518170198242
Martello you call it?	6.145774566524289
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	7.553132476000978
But ours is the _omphalos_.	15.245211494169302
—What is your idea of Hamlet?	19.81188583063393
Haines asked Stephen.	8.65944294561986
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	14.002511498037432
I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up.	11.654145153020824
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	16.139876844140833
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: —You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	12.744130254172015
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	15.412579190331524
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	12.190876152196857
Is it some paradox?	20.782035072401037
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	2.9271314425470503
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	19.80002943075132
It’s quite simple.	18.56969917201688
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	12.39472052439244
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	18.21054533462539
He himself?	15.782923272247585
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear: —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	13.261526057304243
And it is rather long to tell.	23.61172911405553
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	17.18969398472105
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	4.3972789853634335
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	18.00093655969934
_That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?	7.895061325772189
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.	16.190767951308544
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	10.671868359519989
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	10.17868320928195
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	10.595922088686606
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	18.4804624702341
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	25.049360215790838
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	17.90062788158504
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	15.26501012989841
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	10.045851001568407
He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	15.43900743534774
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.	16.80879923096914
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	8.84284253478721
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._ He held up a forefinger of warning.	15.49525732331597
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again._ He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	13.025736521406968
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy...	9.88492482397349
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	9.808300484923045
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.	12.48814128994629
He’s rather blasphemous.	21.740343448100965
I’m not a believer myself, that is to say.	10.258777146037634
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow, doesn’t it?	5.618850945410725
What did he call it?	9.873592085626587
Joseph the Joiner?	16.92538249648606
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	10.333350353090255
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	26.969553322714287
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	18.000996232642944
—You’re not a believer, are you?	7.959657725532631
Haines asked.	11.495592740981188
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	28.617564336599646
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	8.107980674925669
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	10.592286848215215
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	10.064495314140027
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	7.122337438499186
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	14.087796172308613
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	15.885595839789843
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	11.726157632056486
Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it?	6.292071928752239
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God.	11.628074489729803
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?	18.019933517116133
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	12.305246674114931
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	23.20151666215354
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	13.18433936003461
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	14.815316004643776
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	15.130993169273562
He wants that key.	14.815032623546891
It is mine.	23.282279161847164
I paid the rent.	16.906247839029827
Now I eat his salt bread.	10.117045638760818
Give him the key too.	11.805946736477816
All.	25.50621404370786
He will ask for it.	6.67495628244433
That was in his eyes.	13.591072276906008
—After all, Haines began...	6.404391889640748
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	23.097302764440613
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	16.98818712812541
You are your own master, it seems to me.	10.416499109415124
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	22.94560526636769
Haines said.	5.46199924432213
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	15.131101928575964
Kneel down before me.	5.850199956097028
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	18.023196462241735
Haines said again.	13.640005637436854
What do you mean?	11.839674394825947
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	11.65097143231422
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	15.006112377180768
An Irishman must think like that, I daresay.	14.781421877240131
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	8.044702123025486
It seems history is to blame.	7.020604065088357
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	6.491387731787817
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	11.044994752004742
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	9.799413678183937
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	11.953839673458441
Idle mockery.	13.943843522115227
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	14.844033494199273
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	5.598066556521952
I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	10.733522231872223
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.	9.426048135526395
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.	11.171992045327132
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.	21.242720587833155
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	21.307792198702153
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.	6.584426486529229
It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	14.054174302285332
It’s nine days today.	14.767948498222104
The man that was drowned.	18.17943331799219
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	12.132688422330046
Here I am.	15.646297494290323
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	20.115176529103117
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	13.056569966777689
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	13.750712180670522
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?	20.812128410177312
—Down in Westmeath.	15.331125603964113
With the Bannons.	19.16681357793786
—Still there?	13.43945876593051
I got a card from Bannon.	30.375633752710634
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	9.45908797508751
Photo girl he calls her.	6.47123433765101
—Snapshot, eh?	4.82999269833261
Brief exposure.	16.58211792698403
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	10.06104074785427
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	5.927272269508815
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	12.14928456815071
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	13.656580854003542
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	23.22082410970464
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	17.752866056027344
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	10.735593653269763
—Going over next week to stew.	6.143808783769307
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	14.315369389381152
—Spooning with him last night on the pier.	21.471553325445843
The father is rotto with money.	6.626536687226258
—Is she up the pole?	28.774331707948498
—Better ask Seymour that.	4.099129907397037
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	3.3049779751197996
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: —Redheaded women buck like goats.	17.444514889221164
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	14.257714425396786
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	9.434313728696265
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	29.642039507866592
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	16.638032582207543
—Are you going in here, Malachi?	19.887724946223774
Make room in the bed.	9.327732016657858
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	13.431105196066294
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	17.52907830870802
—Are you not coming in?	15.955575245290369
Buck Mulligan asked.	9.819963444641035
—Later on, Haines said.	6.794534958797736
Not on my breakfast.	15.973223768025468
Stephen turned away.	16.004020272061062
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.	7.76566265099414
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	10.473498981038608
Stephen handed him the key.	14.88695215546088
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	11.477858027254612
—And twopence, he said, for a pint.	23.42040308814619
Throw it there.	8.278347429735794
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	16.498199175577295
Dressing, undressing.	11.148858409578036
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	28.434354760470782
Thus spake Zarathustra.	11.148858409578036
His plump body plunged.	7.622878559556313
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	11.173032292419967
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	24.62990009688816
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	11.806251405945757
Half twelve.	11.089130599646298
—Good, Stephen said.	6.342164942950427
He walked along the upwardcurving path.	11.516003727670723
Liliata rutilantium.	14.45922143842678
Turma circumdet.	12.212364007875731
Iubilantium te virginum.	8.9860352863664
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	15.021675649041896
I will not sleep here tonight.	9.32529016128631
Home also I cannot go.	7.153912958980944
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	3.5371229670173334
Turning the curve he waved his hand.	4.84114208714437
It called again.	4.883734682030202
A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round.	18.86222203794724
Usurper.	32.13581597679176
[ 2 ] —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	11.064352001003035
—Tarentum, sir.	3.9643324688742196
—Very good.	10.481190591817722
Well?	17.685021073205338
—There was a battle, sir.	10.020786600864511
—Very good.	10.481190591817722
Where?	14.036610527842967
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.	12.539745727915394
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	17.727545833265044
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	9.950996040229922
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	6.980429726748808
What’s left us then?	19.698837107240017
—I forget the place, sir.	30.17402327238407
279 B.	6.971921761057613
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	15.946215517521727
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for._ That phrase the world had remembered.	15.003178692072131
A dull ease of the mind.	9.882727269782084
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	9.572591938676252
Any general to any officers.	11.296873571782095
They lend ear.	6.576650952291391
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	5.27682830845161
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	27.42474637227964
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?	8.77280257353846
—I know, sir.	10.801238145517697
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	5.05806036463498
—Wait.	14.590476318694487
You, Armstrong.	19.731488354467285
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	16.261863723997223
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel.	9.584425409979486
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly.	6.505472344001324
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips.	16.25481451293729
A sweetened boy’s breath.	12.316700231403818
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	13.098884376936043
Vico Road, Dalkey.	8.55639188197318
—Pyrrhus, sir?	7.674270431744198
Pyrrhus, a pier.	34.44054923281554
All laughed.	9.573690248878348
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	5.829401928940252
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	8.239415873113758
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	12.135195208571492
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	24.903519599623422
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	9.455588681374682
A thing out in the water.	17.206005038156537
A kind of a bridge.	15.49586819924392
Kingstown pier, sir.	3.9730853592788216
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	10.742480190974774
Two in the back bench whispered.	16.544130760446706
Yes.	9.732442163148734
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	8.612882069326073
All.	25.50621404370786
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	7.513437144162763
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	11.395988193850322
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	3.7499243770260686
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	26.071038003039796
The words troubled their gaze.	6.866264033930339
—How, sir?	16.16779447995175
Comyn asked.	6.175031302735487
A bridge is across a river.	8.004257155785652
For Haines’s chapbook.	26.431179229370375
No-one here to hear.	11.656543755534372
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	14.440536584053634
What then?	9.573690248878348
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise.	13.989585841698366
Why had they chosen all that part?	10.582300520953146
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	19.49181163784874
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	14.429575802282587
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	8.924985174651496
They are not to be thought away.	11.918577330272893
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	19.749343749695782
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	10.984042386671407
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	19.266712781658228
—Tell us a story, sir.	9.567330045818343
—O, do, sir.	13.399211999931124
A ghoststory.	16.58211792698403
—Where do you begin in this?	14.594751893266183
Stephen asked, opening another book.	10.305195152495912
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.	6.903454480201353
—Go on then, Talbot.	11.228744675711768
—And the story, sir?	14.423551398312428
—After, Stephen said.	4.857232370481945
Go on, Talbot.	13.95214975529448
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	9.427068974204403
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	10.651570207981436
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	11.60333229850556
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	7.036872919037387
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	10.364302109785656
Thought is the thought of thought.	22.763882368833325
Tranquil brightness.	13.943843522115227
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	23.90059585635757
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	5.4806254342210305
Talbot repeated: _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might..._ —Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	8.921581124413258
I don’t see anything.	13.91734230068371
—What, sir?	18.154879270655073
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	6.852726507957096
His hand turned the page over.	13.736227840412687
Of him that walked the waves.	7.691457542102005
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine.	9.833626100558911
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	11.134276677220575
To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s.	19.280424081189995
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms.	20.79559376340678
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	15.681209731652478
My father gave me seeds to sow.	13.08714495959177
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	7.806372724750457
—Have I heard all?	17.127683117696378
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
Hockey at ten, sir.	3.9584685813869185
—Half day, sir.	6.494910363259308
Thursday.	20.244295502353957
—Who can answer a riddle?	13.240018627416774
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	5.416325411194342
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: —A riddle, sir?	7.723503724714769
Ask me, sir.	4.6059855595674835
—O, ask me, sir.	10.802085749225842
—A hard one, sir.	12.903454966066231
—This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	12.057679993389883
’Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	11.894706707863678
What is that?	8.897663952733545
—What, sir?	18.154879270655073
—Again, sir.	5.0160674462962245
We didn’t hear.	7.071794463414509
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	15.18082002459508
After a silence Cochrane said: —What is it, sir?	11.451657735924304
We give it up.	6.049801959006155
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	15.707216211629325
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	9.312407943042087
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: —Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	11.413108910082649
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	14.25078199495599
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	8.373861781548177
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	6.932864146355754
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.	8.44296215740212
He held out his copybook.	26.899505158037513
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	17.65121519328631
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	7.704972284684189
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	18.04836957526661
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	20.540833424831927
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	15.477604128869496
Futility.	32.13581597679176
—Do you understand how to do them now?	17.566067088084672
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	4.413007673976454
Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board, sir.	16.071229754859544
—Can you do them yourself?	11.5983521447163
—No, sir.	5.04976211744074
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed.	11.212629470336243
Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart.	20.265787182273712
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	24.01611647126627
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	7.716681871792911
Was that then real?	20.33847581516464
The only true thing in life?	11.996749088100318
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	7.317309621992127
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	20.165415596997384
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	15.865481832652375
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	10.561086530125378
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	15.612910924180161
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.	9.914874219390306
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	8.079925696362952
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	29.31836419324761
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	9.278261036160856
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	9.416258623526355
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	10.831413432800215
—Do you understand now?	11.30476769102933
Can you work the second for yourself?	25.458194642724067
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data.	5.039775617670823
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	10.723228972454413
_Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive.	11.303343629405108
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	8.854115438144717
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	18.390525684474287
My childhood bends beside me.	4.247841964681215
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	15.189965021140353
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	11.109943570392652
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	8.974452639837681
The sum was done.	6.845167398669259
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	12.199371102236366
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
Thanks, Sargent answered.	7.930272398778111
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	11.882291749514934
—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.	19.593887468208543
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	25.374232763093758
—Sargent! —Run on, Stephen said.	6.939132747359681
Mr Deasy is calling you.	7.758629003998609
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	13.223093727266871
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	9.440080060814665
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	1.725587925957617
He turned his angry white moustache.	11.648804581290637
—What is it now?	14.07361501107464
he cried continually without listening.	8.955488840623074
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	6.585276989118735
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	11.67795260629851
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly: —What is the matter?	19.422152969526394
What is it now?	14.13441197400164
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	9.585452654051881
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	12.896193988207104
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	15.993293021233466
As it was in the beginning, is now.	18.968685054118655
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	11.127592777203416
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	8.590790521491156
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	25.56915442930893
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	9.089020583831488
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.	4.507976637036395
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong.	14.252031657512893
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	12.194741750023118
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	7.9207646399896525
And now his strongroom for the gold.	15.300284519762847
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	13.369204024128337
An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	9.307755372703665
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	17.21109553915741
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	9.987967203659329
These are handy things to have.	7.191849437605857
See.	18.793139189616713
This is for sovereigns.	17.117008145485595
This is for shillings.	13.24118115227426
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	11.148858409578036
And here crowns.	14.525728433648423
See.	18.793139189616713
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	9.192898558351036
—Three twelve, he said.	4.150932407686964
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	9.76105292309814
—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	6.151847228971593
You have earned it.	6.933395342140363
Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells.	28.282957673742175
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	18.41934307033811
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	9.068246783516878
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	5.764724245027588
You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	12.482171497802632
You just buy one of these machines.	12.974159642383569
You’ll find them very handy.	14.369283887939742
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	5.005645036762383
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	22.84726246273671
Three times now.	6.724720173082869
Well?	17.685021073205338
I can break them in this instant if I will.	24.806751008202827
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	12.213931547095452
You don’t know yet what money is.	5.778663621646738
Money is power.	8.080465848484218
When you have lived as long as I have.	15.53044115562018
I know, I know.	13.261501263434598
If youth but knew.	5.801773357316895
But what does Shakespeare say?	9.854015906917333
_Put but money in thy purse._ —Iago, Stephen murmured.	12.509542105521952
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.	26.230117875914218
—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said.	9.573402951484189
He made money.	10.312593522108475
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	12.639091438136816
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	26.12060743086233
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?	19.058816139878502
The seas’ ruler.	9.072081681998874
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	17.536917863156585
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	23.75317145406951
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	16.154521194491352
That’s not English.	18.03049477631269
A French Celt said that.	4.472661950050151
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	12.180348087915611
—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	15.78425664605914
_I paid my way._ Good man, good man.	12.374596596455516
_—I paid my way.	10.970085247147056
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel that?	16.412475679716053
_I owe nothing._ Can you?	6.997044120423764
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	17.793667855097915
Curran, ten guineas.	10.277215718224017
McCann, one guinea.	21.943309815688128
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	11.069006701752665
Temple, two lunches.	22.285149194782047
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board.	11.85123113754221
The lump I have is useless.	12.517586991683498
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	20.44439111547384
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	17.798732051979027
—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously.	21.537664174916333
But one day you must feel it.	10.331008656761265
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	10.666850682662036
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	17.56374101465635
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	12.920441870548776
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	13.221746504457997
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.	12.715246137989677
I remember the famine in ’46.	9.50898889582664
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	13.56072867909664
You fenians forget some things.	5.028291818418275
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	6.062520842810636
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	4.101978546749398
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters’ covenant.	11.002821868865341
The black north and true blue bible.	9.926461765363332
Croppies lie down.	5.669497175335421
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	11.296873571782095
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	10.588516959556918
On the spindle side.	12.000312834358382
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	20.954461187900623
We are all Irish, all kings’ sons.	13.823819061590184
—Alas, Stephen said.	3.0452396092909093
—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	12.337292732388866
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	14.281796072595958
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin.	5.857009397755579
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	5.039775617670823
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	4.527637153435295
Day!...	2.201367084227408
Day!...	2.201367084227408
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin.	7.6869423498313365
Lal the ral the ra.	8.68745168372438
Lal the ral the raddy.	8.03835114938011
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	7.119735380986374
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	56.1343111026689
I have a letter here for the press.	32.56905214992466
Sit down a moment.	14.374293332989946
I have just to copy the end.	15.588131509286464
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	27.42431553304242
—Sit down.	5.521842410738406
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common sense._ Just a moment.	8.374283533755085
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	13.779885683393104
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	8.611398535667501
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ _Repulse_, the duke of Westminster’s _Shotover_, the duke of Beaufort’s _Ceylon_, _prix de Paris_, 1866.	9.46160267896149
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	16.136850741167923
He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	13.728064625256305
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	13.079851521179535
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question..._ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	10.724074769600946
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	9.941814739218874
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	15.102092558543127
Again: a goal.	17.069946159397386
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	13.930267879172266
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	12.061432575647522
Jousts.	32.13581597679176
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	5.0965544461928545
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.	13.742276903226806
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	17.09140402873424
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	10.932887014673238
Stephen stood up.	5.274946864842512
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	14.809526492143789
It’s about the foot and mouth disease.	12.276986051674896
Just look through it.	5.231153914616817
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	14.293398481539416
May I trespass on your valuable space.	8.824572099411686
That doctrine of _laissez faire_ which so often in our history.	6.559823102274001

To come to the point at issue.	19.541411167412004
—I don’t mince words, do I?	21.07121910338557
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	8.987532300799971
Foot and mouth disease.	6.691843718401972
Known as Koch’s preparation.	19.455884189298065

Allimportant question.	9.105249025485831
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	19.631083458535752
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	12.369037846692887
And it can be cured.	21.80361640680111
It is cured.	29.368544992620652
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	6.6175352885372085
They offer to come over here.	7.464710413027684
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	19.96306112879539
Now I’m going to try publicity.	16.531858853258534
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	10.004653570898402
intrigues by...	3.624412641305564
backstairs influence by...	3.39180688408973
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	13.429748296517198
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	27.69148679840795
England is in the hands of the jews.	29.1347134602807
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	19.262545909947455
And they are the signs of a nation’s decay.	37.79413552244187
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength.	12.247032073599176
I have seen it coming these years.	10.96033800484188
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	13.880752453109041
Old England is dying.	8.592917319534681
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	15.107808699955596
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	10.083158376056845
The harlot’s cry from street to street Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.	7.241588848994059
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted.	12.430632789522798
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	13.12899908444205
—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	20.003399041178444
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	23.790247967557754
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	7.512675179812894
Gabble of geese.	7.791124599957709
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	9.285507473333247
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	9.410120302125758
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	9.307497706344837
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	5.636211105707435
Time surely would scatter all.	3.965268253004198
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	5.666330730292452
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	11.008563371004364
—Who has not?	31.69529538638817
Stephen said.	4.142530577726673
—What do you mean?	22.557134308939467
Mr Deasy asked.	9.651153501825009
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	16.613581693012353
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly.	5.636211105707435
Is this old wisdom?	15.331125603964113
He waits to hear from me.	8.465590745658464
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	15.556702777802423
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	20.034030123198814
A whirring whistle: goal.	6.708426236547828
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	13.518994208021347
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	10.10764187194011
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	8.185012593637689
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: —That is God.	13.273670359564766
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! —What?	9.107134341971681
Mr Deasy asked.	9.651153501825009
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	15.077875834850415
Looking up again he set them free.	11.561733687045736
—I am happier than you are, he said.	8.430759677622886
We have committed many errors and many sins.	8.163952900102624
A woman brought sin into the world.	4.9181448762793805
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	11.840583620598183
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	10.793912318715677
A woman too brought Parnell low.	8.622756692332196
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	12.471868853069187
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	13.91034679148884
But I will fight for the right till the end.	41.51598651557793
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	7.477474848336423
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	9.163833231015003
—Well, sir, he began.	25.534878499643334
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	12.263290056304678
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	13.247163902560793
Perhaps I am wrong.	26.60056054469368
—A learner rather, Stephen said.	6.132091941079637
And here what will you learn more?	14.792199632381969
Mr Deasy shook his head.	8.538032239404519
—Who knows?	21.840534306811765
he said.	3.724527490343976
To learn one must be humble.	16.61779183547663
But life is the great teacher.	27.508967767934596
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	6.74710954123456
—Yes, Mr Deasy said.	4.543644907596127
You have two copies there.	6.865060552389773
If you can have them published at once.	11.1662379036769
_ Telegraph.	13.943843522115227
Irish Homestead._ —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	18.627504517580665
I know two editors slightly.	12.746947494310803
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	10.466715263096734
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	13.51479642963232
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	15.403777445662756
What are they?	15.793542629113343
_—The Evening Telegraph..._ —That will do, Mr Deasy said.	8.188565041541258
There is no time to lose.	25.76950663338049
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	32.19338177808287
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	7.49156563450975
Thank you.	6.017557420495328
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	13.316483483631544
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	18.15219391050668
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	12.385843127175677
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	15.018913407292231
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	15.6801554366272
Still I will help him in his fight.	23.965354082030203
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	18.360475711285716
—Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	10.820995064414317
No more letters, I hope.	42.77393304478691
—Just one moment.	11.252894776276031
—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.	8.490859353954308
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	10.47927269451446
—I just wanted to say, he said.	14.047861673145869
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	15.446257923120337
Do you know that?	11.026155934625253
No. And do you know why?	23.50499665671833
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	12.449799351945842
—Why, sir?	13.443023342200485
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	18.505016529626214
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	11.377848118295653
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	12.725467754437027
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	17.413906724892165
That’s why.	17.070924675557535
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	10.165093790186056
[ 3 ] Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	15.428651357172821
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	17.216389330613623
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	5.039775617670823
Limits of the diaphane.	33.48286549266287
But he adds: in bodies.	15.75866752541998
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	23.51880280672528
How?	17.685021073205338
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	7.819697506214895
Go easy.	12.599684944605478
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	8.695493272965207
Limit of the diaphane in.	13.080333122494746
Why in?	12.599684944605478
Diaphane, adiaphane.	9.70564496856689
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	22.047455457408347
Shut your eyes and see.	11.47076225801574
You are walking through it howsomever.	14.039888438850488
I am, a stride at a time.	16.837251801443273
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	9.217931939825554
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	23.89555498021362
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	31.615306189943755
Open your eyes.	9.774053531395007
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	10.08404802116395
My ash sword hangs at my side.	6.290255561264375
Tap with it: they do.	14.00250689294661
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	29.890084908046344
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	11.646546564801485
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	11.61024106749668
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	7.533246457037691
Wild sea money.	5.767102192370904
Dominie Deasy kens them a’.	11.069876943092078
Rhythm begins, you see.	4.961368044784407
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	5.636211105707435
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	10.418702610315464
Open your eyes now.	6.949795683303347
I will.	14.145629011262553
One moment.	7.851822056789469
Has all vanished since?	8.55639188197318
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	17.715873384848837
_Basta!_ I will see if I can see.	27.577727740180446
See now.	5.230698116280242
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	12.266413896307558
They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	11.205720685010837
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	21.169607788050406
Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s gamp poked in the beach.	21.563331201877112
From the liberties, out for the day.	16.665561024484074
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	10.563175424184783
Creation from nothing.	7.3798142271350775
What has she in the bag?	25.700137624474685
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	6.636279109725772
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	11.8471258494738
That is why mystic monks.	11.560051694835812
Will you be as gods?	32.32058805979951
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	16.698390727929876
Hello.	16.067907988395877
Kinch here.	5.839984039894037
Put me on to Edenville.	24.277029317538922
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	9.039652352862918
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	4.816428770996284
She had no navel.	16.69234441567135
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	6.698265676461437
Womb of sin.	7.502460966055441
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	18.318724015206058
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	31.162271493611353
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will.	14.04104759942344
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	10.290937598394853
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	5.636211105707435
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	12.694523433462695
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	14.98371446534442
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	10.738881478616044
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	10.251232271663149
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	12.116173079870507
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	9.302993100510209
They are coming, waves.	20.825165765189997
And after?	25.958207904662284
The Ship, half twelve.	11.799798068565877
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	15.408589285523984
Yes, I must.	22.6158455403209
His pace slackened.	11.148858409578036
Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not?	17.310898828291037
My consubstantial father’s voice.	8.792683352267396
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	14.036002581980563
No?	20.244295502353957
Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?	14.82154485833498
Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	9.302078697158906
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	21.610140227145187
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	20.300499884054624
The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	16.271304976856555
Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	9.167701009056236
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
No, sir.	6.945860026631445
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	13.209559586547636
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	14.70561822368406
—It’s Stephen, sir.	14.854977353733732
—Let him in.	15.312099146845503
Let Stephen in.	6.789270956270911
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	4.718439775287827
—We thought you were someone else.	12.150479893267914
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	8.408365721762818
Cleanchested.	32.13581597679176
He has washed the upper moiety.	13.711414002858135
—Morrow, nephew.	8.55639188197318
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	5.570879451493807
A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_.	10.732614040494331
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.	5.918345160641638
—Yes, sir?	6.0327450640522695
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother.	11.296741813347829
Where is she?	17.848197711178024
—Bathing Crissie, sir.	4.48121756417241
Papa’s little bedpal.	23.63440198493018
Lump of love.	7.165004417912972
—No, uncle Richie...	5.626488683708275
—Call me Richie.	11.406622102943356
Damn your lithia water.	6.419915703441435
It lowers.	16.58211792698403
Whusky! —Uncle Richie, really...	9.337818371069778
—Sit down or by the law Harry I’ll knock you down.	14.584745232332766
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	10.834356312851094
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	13.734060129008128
—He has nowhere to put it, you mug.	20.12148860498257
Bring in our chippendale chair.	9.296554516997084
Would you like a bite of something?	23.03425484670292
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here.	5.558160212139341
Sure?	32.13581597679176
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	16.26166785817689
_All’erta!_ He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_.	9.766200373552275
The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	17.964899824811724
Listen.	18.793139189616713
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	13.752139050858645
This wind is sweeter.	8.55639188197318
Houses of decay, mine, his and all.	14.417132925194451
You told the Clongowes gentry you had an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army.	10.048612334996987
Come out of them, Stephen.	32.29904830273258
Beauty is not there.	10.781709811082735
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	13.97598549528623
For whom?	11.725328032605423
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	12.429181482464694
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	15.65574714918086
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	11.148858409578036
The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws.	9.628665894038013
Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?	11.20583398743151
Paff! _Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.	4.415108031451106
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	9.065239879923205
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	9.876624557233303
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	8.339772147883615
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	10.72239046789743
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	17.011507672128864
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	13.68458494225178
Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor.	9.91882712664601
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain.	4.329584121636599
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.	11.463596877478697
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	23.129188944006984
Isle of saints.	22.4476276362089
You were awfully holy, weren’t you?	5.833578230640167
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	16.825880842510667
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	11.063896007031941
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about that, eh?	17.2890421451999
What else were they invented for?	12.40307753898837
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	6.157180165388014
I was young.	48.87313661740427
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	9.917471949599047
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one.	6.8435462101609845
Books you were going to write with letters for titles.	10.576878706780985
Have you read his F?	26.182936443601594
O yes, but I prefer Q.	22.409204313420947
Yes, but W is wonderful.	22.804485764033366
O yes, W.	9.126305007497717
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	11.589950406790736
Someone was to read them there after a few thousand years, a mahamanvantara.	35.181438767450715
Pico della Mirandola like.	5.932670779128349
Ay, very like a whale.	30.832293531949954
When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once...	11.687889580737956
The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	10.764746456904122
His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	7.6239714164593435
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man’s ashes.	8.261064494195251
He coasted them, walking warily.	18.91982033048555
A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough.	10.440723074803834
A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst.	5.69954042035486
Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.	10.011107344005316
Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners.	7.673452984131013
He halted.	28.833364133203595
I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s.	14.50686399618487
Am I not going there?	17.94744146878678
Seems not.	8.291058963492015
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse.	13.347928622805057
_—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_ _—C’est le pigeon, Joseph._ Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.	6.710925682520242
Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris.	9.203169171391123
My father’s a bird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump bunny’s face.	7.789664047026803
But he must send me _La Vie de Jésus_ by M.	6.570865167969486
Léo Taxil.	16.58211792698403
Lent it to his friend.	16.07652000264232
_—C’est tordant, vous savez.	8.31071345672942
Moi, je suis socialiste.	7.082569710069092
Je ne crois pas en l’existence de Dieu.	5.6248671985990235
Faut pas le dire à mon père._ _—Il croit?_ _—Mon père, oui._ _Schluss_.	7.656706599869189
He laps.	16.58211792698403
My Latin quarter hat.	4.881549161006283
God, we simply must dress the character.	8.48496623918195
I want puce gloves.	14.385876804178864
Of what in the other devil’s name?	23.015576594529

Eating your groatsworth of _mou en civet_, fleshpots of Egypt, elbowed by belching cabmen.	4.469167722420217

You seem to have enjoyed yourself.	13.151631541621438
Proudly walking.	16.58211792698403

Forget: a dispossessed.	23.01039248151184
Hunger toothache.	13.943843522115227
_Encore deux minutes_.	11.148858409578036
Look clock.	9.85978631029179
Must get.	26.544097885073867
_Fermé_.	32.13581597679176
Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back.	3.51950293168768

O, that’s all right.	6.800626161932548
Shake hands.	10.084389989650608

Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: _Euge! Euge!_ Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the slimy pier at Newhaven.	6.816725600856143
_Comment?_ Rich booty you brought back; _Le Tutu_, five tattered numbers of _Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge_; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show: —Mother dying come home father.	5.487082687551914
The aunt thinks you killed your mother.	4.5603914272854595
That’s why she won’t.	8.202083688176359
Then here’s a health to Mulligan’s aunt And I’ll tell you the reason why.	9.62881940352499

There was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call it his postprandial.	15.611652926129322
Well: _slainte!_ Around the slabbed tables the tangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges.	5.283941795951765
His breath hangs over our saucestained plates, the green fairy’s fang thrusting between his lips.	11.613865228638103

_O, O_.	16.92538249648606
He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.	14.761333510467226
O, O the boys of Kilkenny...	10.855051918050743
Weak wasting hand on mine.	7.995689957002809
Remembering thee, O Sion.	22.51246954709372
He had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.	9.993783979937495
The new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of seeds of brightness.	9.482413583642886
Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship, am I?	13.626095531846378
He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil.	18.161253568104414
Turn back.	6.061679814198452
Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in new sockets.	14.829595405980017
The cold domed room of the tower waits.	15.499585389013609
Through the barbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor.	7.019216234511584
Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	4.327579698308606
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	12.064158923488332
Who to clear it?	7.516551296649075
He has the key.	21.283206228493004
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	9.546080378990013
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	22.148892552397808
Call: no answer.	9.337084047615518
He lifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders.	16.49077845285258
Take all, keep all.	10.692078939173838
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	10.31449337871182
So in the moon’s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore’s tempting flood.	17.760928759793295
The flood is following me.	4.678211753590872
I can watch it flow past from here.	8.354211236967966
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	18.415051542124907
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	11.452088470416044
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	11.636541731241941
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	16.244640760308993
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier’s prose.	9.518415286559312
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	3.0435655957948637
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	12.269191055652788
Hide gold there.	4.629492620734669
Try it.	5.418114139953336
You have some.	35.46970625944773
Sands and stones.	9.528265622403506
Heavy of the past.	13.659057862260777
Sir Lout’s toys.	23.939344502441422
Mind you don’t get one bang on the ear.	13.080637762188818
I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	10.372964250708371
Feefawfum.	32.13581597679176
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	5.504583264405476
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	7.1452649547834906
Lord, is he going to attack me?	21.319667613215216
Respect his liberty.	11.148858409578036
You will not be master of others or their slave.	20.649298579070326
I have my stick.	18.497737336650566
Sit tight.	19.8459753406449
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	13.751996951404728
The two maries.	16.92538249648606
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	7.441903981169187
Peekaboo.	32.13581597679176
I see you.	8.963532925736855
No, the dog.	85.56579761775654
He is running back to them.	12.357529675806026
Who?	12.75310702185393
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	11.926544868385005
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	5.021673410401617
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	6.66723895227714
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	7.646623587602156
Famine, plague and slaughters.	7.082569710069092
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	16.261183421645594
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	17.509881930463795
I spoke to no-one: none to me.	12.335093605796061
The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	14.46181674427142
Dog of my enemy.	23.644784485866833
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	7.2557363777996216
A primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear.	11.63255943756263
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	30.75010448724185
Pretenders: live their lives.	4.693143992018457
The Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	10.491433581614034
All kings’ sons.	5.690760678172217
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	6.66914314356841
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping.	14.913885581693645
But the courtiers who mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house.	8.375266800869316
House of...	6.734598412980264
We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	13.45449902658967
Would you do what he did?	46.438147590964334
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	26.53739543671438
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	11.109015663652638
Would you or would you not?	15.926955911818427
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden’s rock.	13.079362483029366
They are waiting for him now.	15.449043431978383
The truth, spit it out.	6.965626466838734
I would want to.	12.533061682541213
I would try.	31.56612247735249
I am not a strong swimmer.	36.02390857348215
Water cold soft.	11.148858409578036
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	18.398362379059606
Can’t see! Who’s behind me?	13.584847897751706
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	9.824389002860773
If I had land under my feet.	12.48090633265073
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	29.485347522464245
A drowning man.	5.119071363328073
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	14.617472481756913
I...	3.455220067893515
With him together down...	6.109458880891641
I could not save her.	17.328966261390867
Waters: bitter death: lost.	5.571609376461432
A woman and a man.	21.555033497714003
I see her skirties.	27.896045745643566
Pinned up, I bet.	53.83394246861942
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	9.655262313768862
Looking for something lost in a past life.	11.613499870945724
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull.	10.932163873878682
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	9.71307536088079
He turned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks.	15.417234180461689
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	7.3246789396743655
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	10.88058466027018
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	7.310748906600719
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	9.600734745562894
Cocklepickers.	32.13581597679176
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	11.307590284546727
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	13.095539811236273
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	20.261970238010377
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop.	14.482932558125112
The carcass lay on his path.	11.648379369985708
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.	15.191507632717299
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	8.208646943888798
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.	12.350720519679523
—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	13.803321333384929
He slunk back in a curve.	16.39510567679562
Doesn’t see me.	5.946686333434805
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	8.620696877648335
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	7.081019546876484
The simple pleasures of the poor.	25.214715906479796
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	6.201815762130691
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	18.22613956495405
He rooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.	13.881008737805876
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	5.416824565355415
Open hallway.	13.943843522115227
Street of harlots.	8.860608804869138
Remember.	25.50621404370786
Haroun al Raschid.	11.576843182705467
I am almosting it.	9.533400769217664
That man led me, spoke.	19.751315138591117
I was not afraid.	65.40317030068479
The melon he had he held against my face.	18.280278273001766
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	6.5432824295768865
That was the rule, said.	12.40840128528023
In. Come.	11.346596935485902
Red carpet spread.	14.786396833216765
You will see who.	14.640852465590738
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	15.626132679777937
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	8.600381501170789
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	9.23393101376197
Spoils slung at her back.	8.223594176968302
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	6.423608736311263
About her windraw face hair trailed.	6.14633179370776
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	8.132670168653561
When night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	7.539387659783796
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.	8.53775715071325
Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her rancid rags.	12.89717073826463
Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	22.36454106281725
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	2.21694174894494
Couch a hogshead with me then.	6.964744817118187
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	12.673814333803099
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	6.702462031186156
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	10.56245049709857
Language no whit worse than his.	8.936026052110318
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	5.427329358618068
Passing now.	5.230698116280242
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	7.990533969637423
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	11.704781514541938
I am not.	18.504394325831854
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	15.951613401126298
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	10.458688481221854
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	9.504140897774462
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	10.207533981261987
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	10.405354398661235
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	9.917157898026261
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	4.737713951738864
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	10.375351202259932
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	10.606452229868768
My tablets.	16.58211792698403
Mouth to her kiss.	22.665941637567062
No. Must be two of em.	28.486882644030228
Glue em well.	6.576650952291391
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	8.939928320065185
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	4.793244637472922
Paper.	32.13581597679176
The banknotes, blast them.	6.119976789167551
Old Deasy’s letter.	12.1288921872042
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	16.657390376880198
That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	23.83949448406845
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	19.086309898807745
Why not endless till the farthest star?	12.296972072622872
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	12.189921212477234
Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	10.292763156384929
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	7.361616726465689
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	21.31053124979384
Who watches me here?	11.37318665176595
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	6.236488976956184
Signs on a white field.	26.478226770802824
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	10.94667584230605
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	10.926614440928997
Hold hard.	14.433750202917158
Coloured on a flat: yes, that’s right.	12.739672585497871
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	11.383430552153795
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	15.010478074193275
Click does the trick.	6.201128553272905
You find my words dark.	7.002936862754004
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	23.351121484951562
Flutier.	32.13581597679176
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	15.585843974055335
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	17.12109708917606
Into the ineluctable modality of the ineluctable visuality.	15.364581163144724
She, she, she.	0.27840552812085034
What she?	8.732813016406928
The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	9.088791205627118
Keen glance you gave her.	7.3733765271975065
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	21.523015927350382
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	15.370878475868672
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	15.238680627574016
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	6.276898696143357
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	6.14633179370776
Where are your wits?	20.04451395463994
Touch me.	6.777985144107338
Soft eyes.	6.061679814198452
Soft soft soft hand.	5.427425532297499
I am lonely here.	11.768386695367974
O, touch me soon, now.	14.457090284380671
What is that word known to all men?	21.402959174524685
I am quiet here alone.	11.7137189149881
Sad too.	5.167893237494866
Touch, touch me.	4.828060253731372
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	9.25942692484886
That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	15.845448878874798
_Et vidit Deus.	11.148858409578036
Et erant valde bona_.	8.55639188197318
Alo! _Bonjour_.	11.148858409578036
Welcome as the flowers in May.	23.17508273559423
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	4.19295206845801
I am caught in this burning scene.	21.09259558613212
Pan’s hour, the faunal noon.	27.843412272987724
Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.	9.336709137213596
Pain is far.	12.82704132222452
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	13.675471598062947
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm.	5.752644564736474
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	6.705548840850334
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	13.692624131441443
_Tiens, quel petit pied!_ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its name.	7.794119181901047
His arm: Cranly’s arm.	8.500438879283182
He now will leave me.	4.247841964681215
And the blame?	29.53978124586774
All or not at all.	5.567456773432679
My ashplant will float away.	4.228263459765334
I shall wait.	12.170613362525879
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	21.703374785203614
Better get this job over quick.	5.861274592830989
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	6.312510755008921
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	7.725844885005519
And, spent, its speech ceases.	10.709494135793626
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	4.797373025228908
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	6.418849811289632
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	8.724654155210292
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	29.075628828751416
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	8.90101885185608
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	6.567455204997135
Five fathoms out there.	6.674130766286921
Full fathom five thy father lies.	7.517103730703015
At one, he said.	4.760584439963949
Found drowned.	12.599684944605478
High water at Dublin bar.	8.062437557823301
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	9.711378109563567
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	7.3979896842035044
There he is.	4.005353764641883
Hook it quick.	7.791124599957709
Pull.	32.13581597679176
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	4.6525935760813955
Easy now.	5.230698116280242
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	5.504583264405476
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	4.298352638979698
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	4.155491802845591
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	10.98266095638168
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	11.228692808479716
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	8.184039435915194
Old Father Ocean.	11.148858409578036
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	6.575701054137248
Just you give it a fair trial.	15.250207390634554
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	8.55639188197318
Come.	14.44968689830552
I thirst.	12.599684944605478
Clouding over.	7.145629591813955
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	7.49435896048237
Thunderstorm.	32.13581597679176
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	6.376302397926301
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	9.141045152283523
Where?	14.036610527842967
To evening lands.	8.728873364464768
Evening will find itself.	8.793027323644484
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	15.596292537024999
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	16.987700564662223
All days make their end.	4.8580086216389375
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	11.762914368582642
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	15.058414790706497
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	7.334618856964561
_Già_.	25.50621404370786
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	12.957719834860322
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	10.945227777102392
_Già_.	25.50621404370786
My teeth are very bad.	5.363676376488523
Why, I wonder.	29.416951029743608
Feel.	25.50621404370786
That one is going too.	18.219619962739372
Shells.	32.13581597679176
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	26.81617784643691
That one.	12.603357909211086
This.	22.281730317965827
Toothless Kinch, the superman.	30.20839300013149
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	16.579617019914966
My handkerchief.	11.725328032605423
He threw it.	6.35928844598229
Did I not take it up?	20.50014063525508
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	15.994976054692506
No, I didn’t.	14.357908011230677
Better buy one.	6.070287361257721
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	12.981842438143744
For the rest let look who will.	11.252420420432493
Behind.	32.13581597679176
Perhaps there is someone.	13.687345623756702
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	19.97796930808092
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	10.312646170849213
— II — [ 4 ] Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.	7.055749573220017
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes.	6.739910021037791
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	9.850855646595223
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	18.195916426529784
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	10.499842143974137
Made him feel a bit peckish.	22.742392611269942
The coals were reddening.	8.55639188197318
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	8.72597511587365
She didn’t like her plate full.	8.23358256014279
Right.	16.79925355716022
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	17.362778778294807
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	7.5324369419370845
Cup of tea soon.	15.225898073846668
Mouth dry.	11.089130599646298
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.	8.581671535094468
—Mkgnao! —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	13.498359773127605
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	8.663339056026498
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	6.439517246972131
Prr.	25.50621404370786
Scratch my head.	9.73599075328332
Prr.	25.50621404370786
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	6.027228450870242
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	21.624803828147396
He bent down to her, his hands on his knees.	21.33573677563609
—Milk for the pussens, he said.	6.607331050006748
—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	8.163516499007894
They call them stupid.	20.04451395463994
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	7.323914151990497
She understands all she wants to.	5.72205638779849
Vindictive too.	5.167893237494866
Cruel.	25.50621404370786
Her nature.	9.85978631029179
Curious mice never squeal.	8.55639188197318
Seem to like it.	4.6292351897953665
Wonder what I look like to her.	22.58424664386711
Height of a tower?	22.060328200886367
No, she can jump me.	1.717879989580834
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	20.894548808318937
Afraid of the chookchooks.	33.48286549266287
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	24.76965862934334
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	7.899868851150894
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	10.431044071176816
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	7.92121878152137
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	15.505770573926284
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	10.383271313882174
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after.	11.78604159523837
Why?	12.497976142926124
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	21.233095738016026
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	13.025423805953261
He listened to her licking lap.	12.87051392003671
Ham and eggs, no.	10.835574471608364
No good eggs with this drouth.	8.061156047594487
Want pure fresh water.	7.678283884692887
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.	12.70645553515136
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	17.277693042511835
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.	5.826245627826833
While the kettle is boiling.	16.39379487881766
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	7.468050827425873
Why are their tongues so rough?	8.747943063179333
To lap better, all porous holes.	13.821899716518647
Nothing she can eat?	13.00375475757884
He glanced round him.	6.1477967770803
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	16.96471333363445
She might like something tasty.	11.675914154005923
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	7.114754865308831
Still perhaps: once in a way.	7.358695102647031
He said softly in the bare hall: —I’m going round the corner.	12.430209158768914
Be back in a minute.	11.112127482830816
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: —You don’t want anything for breakfast?	15.94834211787716
A sleepy soft grunt answered: —Mn. No. She didn’t want anything.	8.075354651491667
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	17.95365980687013
Must get those settled really.	8.188323181489343
Pity.	22.281730317965827
All the way from Gibraltar.	25.078160826614276
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	5.891521341701929
Wonder what her father gave for it.	8.695418503462136
Old style.	11.089130599646298
Ah yes! of course.	12.82847866782936
Bought it at the governor’s auction.	20.012709226712442
Got a short knock.	12.777965903318442
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	13.419463464701362
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
At Plevna that was.	6.729384080321538
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.	10.90000254535613
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	19.213179354962207
Now that was farseeing.	37.33733811732062
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	13.358453387075
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	7.124763581548046
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	8.012412486367179
Course they do.	9.065236870586771
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha.	14.28973448569441
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	5.227705564653194
White slip of paper.	5.328547774456747
Quite safe.	13.943843522115227
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	20.112730435125616
Not there.	7.8669916930878205
In the trousers I left off.	16.491753176370636
Must get it.	16.65294822162275
Potato I have.	9.053113386662488
Creaky wardrobe.	16.58211792698403
No use disturbing her.	6.490139110417894
She turned over sleepily that time.	7.678905890842094
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	17.29951836205357
Looked shut.	10.595029903244942
All right till I come back anyhow.	20.251280124698773
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	15.37864158084597
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.	8.767475904055601
Be a warm day I fancy.	20.862864369371795
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	6.402377100652859
Black conducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat.	11.63061799255892
But I couldn’t go in that light suit.	17.313333180888158
Make a picnic of it.	7.4712427767178085
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	6.601412173775791
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	10.012094809033592
Makes you feel young.	14.881603352552682
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	15.751366733029716
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.	11.800807707219258
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	19.08565760306172
Wander through awned streets.	6.791212737248195
Turbaned faces going by.	7.484601108505241
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	6.539997360912916
Cries of sellers in the streets.	21.460065552333457
Drink water scented with fennel, sherbet.	6.439517246972131
Might meet a robber or two.	7.489334932155435
Well, meet him.	9.606414888211503
Getting on to sundown.	26.459331711063264
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	11.172621047688251
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	19.071836073836494
I pass on.	9.833137491644065
Fading gold sky.	7.791124599957709
A mother watches me from her doorway.	14.626686008314943
She calls her children home in their dark language.	13.542551124879145
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	5.636211105707435
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new garters.	9.431158827586462
Strings.	32.13581597679176
Listen.	18.793139189616713
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	10.780179837708978
I pass.	16.61508692820113
Probably not a bit like it really.	27.606989810365008
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	18.732775787038285
Sunburst on the titlepage.	31.480130803433042
He smiled, pleasing himself.	6.755736900345483
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	11.906245239116656
He prolonged his pleased smile.	5.097223948368648
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	6.459035057918641
He approached Larry O’Rourke’s.	7.841739884405399
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	9.667171079240656
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	8.474697707087751
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	19.476939056809442
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n.	20.63469708941422
g.	22.281730317965827
as position.	13.943843522115227
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	14.599743786327203
Baldhead over the blind.	31.59072519592613
Cute old codger.	11.148858409578036
No use canvassing him for an ad.	11.348134650800738
Still he knows his own business best.	14.974123257660002
There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket.	9.269583464111195
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	14.216827168843588
Do you know what I’m going to tell you?	7.93039871855573
What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?	20.026038029472222
Do you know what?	16.728819287510653
The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.	13.618819399528421
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	12.117368546743046
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: —Good day, Mr O’Rourke.	14.72042258395806
—Good day to you.	10.949094429222546
—Lovely weather, sir.	5.482647001961208
—’Tis all that.	7.310955587782119
Where do they get the money?	23.150252112613458
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	12.29838536076585
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	7.56160311955713
Then think of the competition.	26.46268766184737
General thirst.	12.599684944605478
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	7.084304499855479
Save it they can’t.	7.267538039303474
Off the drunks perhaps.	6.374538640071603
Put down three and carry five.	7.986653951737082
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	17.56999080508464
On the wholesale orders perhaps.	8.670986354236527
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	14.821552423596716
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job, see?	12.279746264633765
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	21.617409485624936
Say ten barrels of stuff.	10.879715630402368
Say he got ten per cent off.	7.910401742660917
O more.	7.145629591813955
Fifteen.	22.281730317965827
He passed Saint Joseph’s National school.	13.416281512198406
Brats’ clamour.	11.148858409578036
Windows open.	8.425917152462297

At their joggerfry.	16.92538249648606
Slieve Bloom.	5.692550280399153
He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	17.05217251863281
Fifteen multiplied by.	9.49475999028879
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	12.79390767229951
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.	5.769401412472827
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	12.783053061274227
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	21.928272644225355
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	20.366201139071457
Chapped: washingsoda.	11.148858409578036
And a pound and a half of Denny’s sausages.	20.353497365609048
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	17.79091444901044
Woods his name is.	10.67514800518509
Wife is oldish.	11.148858409578036
New blood.	10.595029903244942
No followers allowed.	9.70564496856689
Strong pair of arms.	20.014346647009422
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	16.32771445712763
She does whack it, by George.	15.148984953616555
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	8.780059443435771
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	8.76249967599586
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	13.28588473884608
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias.	10.158253318656023
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	7.082569710069092
Moses Montefiore.	16.58211792698403
I thought he was.	9.278379855664472
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	10.526821753702652
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	21.597175994899477
A young white heifer.	10.794662732664037
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	8.89766299553055
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	13.494768415411949
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	5.321952094838546
—Now, my miss, he said.	6.511444117084179
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	8.018657017172222
—Thank you, my miss.	10.787909732825527
And one shilling threepence change.	8.123732307563886
For you, please?	39.61497205726112
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	18.27489679074626
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	15.548534263755888
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	10.736690458402228
Hurry up, damn it.	7.590330274499721
Make hay while the sun shines.	18.215441378298497
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	9.707495591365836
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	21.318952086348524
Sodachapped hands.	7.085323528730332
Crusted toenails too.	4.387016086573923
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	4.6053545689685045
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	4.262086951486752
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane.	9.937765054020176
They like them sizeable.	16.383704346744192
Prime sausage.	16.58211792698403
O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood.	20.162894435124674
—Threepence, please.	5.778787916368525
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	5.320225496362817
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	11.785656004544647
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	8.397757124083796
—Thank you, sir.	4.356863316541317
Another time.	5.672954291597353
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	4.317510854966674
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	9.11637140766986
No: better not: another time.	7.925183199847139
—Good morning, he said, moving away.	10.119774795326071
—Good morning, sir.	4.139380263667999
No sign.	10.595029903244942
Gone.	17.685021073205338
Agendath Netaim: planters’ company.	8.97035682252049
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	4.057701737550962
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	6.717826135804198
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	6.974842395999027
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	7.099142504202737
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	4.804899744189562
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	21.294403737323606
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	20.816066816711103
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	15.749143464173114
Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W.	6.019161918892869
15.	10.22983825673218
Nothing doing.	19.8459753406449
Still an idea behind it.	5.170478380514821
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	13.826382212313113
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	16.58211792698403
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	7.533246457037691
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	4.398357393179949
I have a few left from Andrews.	18.10894745930359
Molly spitting them out.	5.524654866159643
Knows the taste of them now.	9.825046426681675
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	8.120448727366957
Citrons too.	5.167893237494866
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade.	14.51304588593718
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	21.085339595267666
Pleasant evenings we had then.	10.954864995162243
Molly in Citron’s basketchair.	25.546669635393556
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	15.606174285351292
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	14.185924711685272
Always the same, year after year.	8.754516829249843
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	5.29689219286312
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	6.384495042020181
Must be without a flaw, he said.	9.349811110370517
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	17.236896668066095
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	10.639999588330708
There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	20.24285599247185
How do you?	8.52809131584439
Doesn’t see.	6.846409488828663
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	20.319251454982627
His back is like that Norwegian captain’s.	10.087402755171734
Wonder if I’ll meet him today.	19.535105567786943
Watering cart.	10.19448965235056
To provoke the rain.	7.864944919268103
On earth as it is in heaven.	19.27905640333577
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	8.568224611023886
Grey.	32.13581597679176
Far.	18.793139189616713
No, not like that.	15.556166127399653
A barren land, bare waste.	12.663892988748916
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	11.879984410968783
No wind could lift those waves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters.	5.379220895579342
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	10.868182775673262
All dead names.	7.791124599957709
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	21.53973604865249
Old now.	5.230698116280242
It bore the oldest, the first race.	16.251857449981124
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	8.691899002008212
The oldest people.	7.034454096093026
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	10.81768998733932
It lay there now.	4.796121998083514
Now it could bear no more.	5.464075665599853
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	14.975758470560558
Desolation.	32.13581597679176
Grey horror seared his flesh.	5.282963251924015
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	14.353294979105863
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	6.934037526542599
Well, I am here now.	8.5305787608025
Yes, I am here now.	9.653495414075731
Morning mouth bad images.	8.55639188197318
Got up wrong side of the bed.	7.653338403945393
Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises.	11.31463874141253
Blotchy brown brick houses.	6.347442741854127
Number eighty still unlet.	8.55639188197318
Why is that?	6.501213011680011
Valuation is only twentyeight.	12.116599241714928
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	4.458178366614379
Plasters on a sore eye.	13.480041262676265
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	11.567644458303574
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	8.01192856955856
Yes, yes.	9.428950605685886
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	8.202219635920072
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	13.102473199201366
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	26.307465371644145
He stooped and gathered them.	4.637149370029624
His quickened heart slowed at once.	4.249173210053155
Bold hand.	6.103335874593452
Mrs Marion.	9.256197713267152
—Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	5.96083917679802
—Who are the letters for?	33.93432519368222
He looked at them.	7.5988915027336255
Mullingar.	18.793139189616713
Milly.	25.50621404370786
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	25.025146312525017
And a letter for you.	15.454937471384662
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	8.3641548724276
—That do?	18.538714376322005
he asked, turning.	16.695500605535987
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	18.30918540077529
—She got the things, she said.	2.132296261557396
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	13.67169396556366
—Hurry up with that tea, she said.	1.940618630337613
I’m parched.	24.08682475129976
—The kettle is boiling, he said.	5.218438659005382
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	9.754855843109548
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: —Poldy! —What?	19.81029639345135
—Scald the teapot.	13.439721399175724
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	16.282347526306875
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	13.232966996086446
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	13.751359011740215
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	7.033097548066152
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.	13.784129857703672
Say they won’t eat pork.	9.098055478706591
Kosher.	22.281730317965827
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	11.08381028433195
Pepper.	32.13581597679176
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	16.551145781278716
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	13.957232347925268
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls.	6.090627579914028
The tea was drawn.	9.645223575437983
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	8.360525981047548
Silly Milly’s birthday gift.	16.74316344145325
Only five she was then.	16.0687438908805
No, wait: four.	15.590460696625527
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	10.710023512924973
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	10.68534268367185
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	31.992856133841055
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	5.575195129654245
I’d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.	9.879211017983318
Poor old professor Goodwin.	16.95542487140192
Dreadful old case.	7.184257632960914
Still he was a courteous old chap.	19.63000739936368
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	13.090677369456934
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	22.00161685083419
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	17.724320350664275
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed.	15.982460457253113
Sex breaking out even then.	5.214395447309023
Pert little piece she was.	5.8404349112305605
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	13.51551172091454
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	7.094581474842027
Everything on it?	9.416260929536165
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	13.752032166907041
Yes.	9.732442163148734
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	19.068448410409246
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	17.18974191766766
—What a time you were! she said.	14.26107976707112
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	11.1267475903321
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.	12.554839695623249
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	20.52746622852341
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	7.278982478435335
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	10.548295738375039
—Who was the letter from?	55.84278814200957
Bold hand.	6.103335874593452
Marion.	16.067907988395877
—O, Boylan, she said.	1.790456943929301
He’s bringing the programme.	17.965974618989236
—What are you singing?	19.368596576776948
—_Là ci darem_ with J.	3.320962667533418
Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.	5.460625859352644
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	11.555754986809971
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	3.8782606590191286
Like foul flowerwater.	11.148858409578036
—Would you like the window open a little?	30.081493746437033
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: —What time is the funeral?	12.268292006836436
—Eleven, I think, he answered.	22.31386311262216
I didn’t see the paper.	9.33635835991564
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	16.281474208928223
No?	20.244295502353957
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	9.09451709492612
—No: that book.	31.730521597078226
Other stocking.	11.725328032605423
Her petticoat.	16.58211792698403
—It must have fell down, she said.	2.691668553149779
He felt here and there.	7.38543391960141
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	8.082305941357252
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	13.072793367280767
Not in the bed.	14.571080666446806
Must have slid down.	7.715890545436008
He stooped and lifted the valance.	13.90062682461605
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	16.139293604949973
—Show here, she said.	0.8352214312043434
I put a mark in it.	10.858576263651097
There’s a word I wanted to ask you.	18.503791566223242
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	10.597845287362563
—Met him what?	12.344686655971206
—Here, she said.	0.5836508592444162
What does that mean?	7.86167088889649
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	9.121930709638656
—Metempsychosis?	27.943134074106364
Who’s he when he’s at home?	20.894396799100903
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	16.10624870249853
It’s Greek: from the Greek.	24.490095998815498
That means the transmigration of souls.	5.714969085937428
—O, rocks! she said.	9.3697839681292
Tell us in plain words.	13.993570544662964
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	8.700052123020452
The same young eyes.	11.861442499711856
The first night after the charades.	23.809128791217784
Dolphin’s Barn.	14.765422284008473
He turned over the smudged pages.	24.782549031907774
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	33.88694501198862
Hello.	16.067907988395877
Illustration.	32.13581597679176
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	10.82639741088797
Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.	22.56744868875618
Sheet kindly lent.	9.70564496856689
_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	11.707469659164552
Cruelty behind it all.	9.755776124487756
Doped animals.	13.943843522115227
Trapeze at Hengler’s.	5.124969891436079
Had to look the other way.	20.24177881340854
Mob gaping.	16.58211792698403
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides.	9.068177630875024
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	10.969351907067557
Our souls.	15.079680280383519
That a man’s soul after he dies.	13.000631559038307
Dignam’s soul...	7.123627702667859
—Did you finish it?	9.998043292069037
—Yes, she said.	0.4535504787415153
There’s nothing smutty in it.	7.933177903264831
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	24.416187903234526
—Never read it.	7.407771456643864
Do you want another?	25.21762206516868
Get another of Paul de Kock’s.	6.017803601721598
Nice name he has.	20.25549334975826
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	14.871493166087568
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	9.710286907571424
Reincarnation: that’s the word.	11.302649540829524
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	16.01210918797614
They call it reincarnation.	21.71503673163128
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	14.494736558895376
They say we have forgotten it.	15.349734416346013
Some say they remember their past lives.	7.974221530101632
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	5.938692916589939
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	20.958335884504766
An example would be better.	12.294230410330742
An example?	23.60097507926347
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	9.126453942989004
Tea before you put milk in.	11.671604491054218
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	14.24241871304562
Three and six I gave for the frame.	34.60673943919228
She said it would look nice over the bed.	15.938376743535137
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	13.983786396477536
He turned the pages back.	18.888946704662075
—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	9.931676416108628
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	14.391935673863342
What they called nymphs, for example.	12.139759784730996
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	15.943133156295648
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	9.101619500151363
—There’s a smell of burn, she said.	2.111732226062182
Did you leave anything on the fire?	39.75877521956179
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.	14.138656359269435
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs.	13.723310708085966
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	18.741701600739418
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.	13.473211376395737
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	9.207745700502622
Cup of tea now.	7.055525338615843
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	17.337308190896803
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	13.711198252442518
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	10.255024379071365
Done to a turn.	27.1007988924894
A mouthful of tea.	8.343517899855843
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	9.412037705582158
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	26.744189385536767
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	13.75253131598472
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	20.599732496423645
It suits me splendid.	6.791212737248195
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	23.133583287668674
I got mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing.	12.792190406825302
They are lovely.	23.56755842364717
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	16.035642100358235
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	29.37825874266673
Will send when developed.	7.622878559556313
We did great biz yesterday.	7.108476678798343
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	11.663135839255812
We are going to lough Owel on Monday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic.	18.81994940426599
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	11.775668660402424
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	28.763589850619763
There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.	22.721793972323763
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls.	10.023604056499936
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	9.267878808224328
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	4.538262119861056
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	7.490825030421342
Byby.	32.13581597679176
M.	9.034798973650673
Fifteen yesterday.	11.725328032605423
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	8.031460090393345
Her first birthday away from home.	10.290825006112923
Separation.	32.13581597679176
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	8.050205738760997
Jolly old woman.	11.60834038157769
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	8.906343035605472
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live.	28.677014178005933
Well, God is good, sir.	16.04496615270684
She knew at once.	8.215642090459832
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	17.564883297984967
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	9.67764814348837
Excuse bad writing.	9.011073697575434
Hurry.	25.50621404370786
Piano downstairs.	12.599684944605478
Coming out of her shell.	26.723419734255806
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	20.626386446589365
Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.	6.794845180790641
Saucebox.	32.13581597679176
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	6.649877961597008
Twelve and six a week.	13.195318411985753
Not much.	15.713579045204575
Still, she might do worse.	1.9352095290643703
Music hall stage.	9.70564496856689
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	11.591928188058887
Then he read the letter again: twice.	15.642787163451542
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	19.855939822975976
But if not?	10.71573899178232
No, nothing has happened.	21.45504755300259
Of course it might.	25.19692107141268
Wait in any case till it does.	11.102352891758173
A wild piece of goods.	11.18186130689126
Destiny.	25.50621404370786
Ripening now.	5.230698116280242
Vain: very.	14.786396833216765
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	15.316192186248207
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	13.81175581897682
Anemic a little.	25.715873203234434
Was given milk too long.	9.751362372887451
On the _Erin’s King_ that day round the Kish.	28.18498712192059
Damned old tub pitching about.	4.650629818995271
Not a bit funky.	30.788002050094263
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	11.468526983556195
All dimpled cheeks and curls, Your head it simply swirls.	5.696150133587341
Seaside girls.	9.573690248878348
Torn envelope.	11.089130599646298
Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	17.99287213188875
Friend of the family.	32.798142972792576
Swurls, he says.	13.769427253847963
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	7.890115226525725
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	5.151760145081913
Milly too.	7.35535231672267
Young kisses: the first.	14.75416519729206
Far away now past.	10.444974283712192
Mrs Marion.	9.256197713267152
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	12.79579483396347
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	7.11955362999192
Will happen, yes.	6.644418781011872
Prevent.	32.13581597679176
Useless: can’t move.	11.913522925222372
Girl’s sweet light lips.	12.010817721723287
Will happen too.	5.81836797873934
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	5.575724866327124
Useless to move now.	8.142772103461041
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	11.461279451786758
Full gluey woman’s lips.	10.018741130481411
Better where she is down there: away.	9.97666195248798
Occupy her.	5.297514951622471
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	5.538988243880292
Might take a trip down there.	7.7203008003522005
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	9.267805822878675
Six weeks off, however.	11.561573995214088
Might work a press pass.	10.113649538982045
Or through M’Coy.	7.353428449288822
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	12.312848025598983
She looked back at him, mewing.	24.62512873877517
Wants to go out.	17.378248499818056
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	10.379778030797493
Let her wait.	8.121876069319235
Has the fidgets.	27.826094575270936
Electric.	32.13581597679176
Thunder in the air.	10.31264983659334
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	19.53607567577861
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	23.625097804912514
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	10.144882934427775
The cat mewed to him.	0.6054360658485421
—Miaow! he said in answer.	10.218150986746782
Wait till I’m ready.	16.26423754714219
Heaviness: hot day coming.	5.028291818418275
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	13.304320859440123
A paper.	11.160212072753245
He liked to read at stool.	15.014022756915546
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I’m.	7.516956404906911
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	18.89256095200495
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	9.652184930328096
The cat went up in soft bounds.	19.874494871530487
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	16.835809811964545
Listening, he heard her voice: —Come, come, pussy.	18.50364933174599
Come.	14.44968689830552
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	21.086707466998064
No sound.	8.928586892958878
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	9.179021834156018
The maid was in the garden.	20.658105080752378
Fine morning.	7.343391160577563
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	6.437645303653949
Make a summerhouse here.	6.702518786295366
Scarlet runners.	16.58211792698403
Virginia creepers.	16.58211792698403
Want to manure the whole place over, scabby soil.	10.559908257889319
A coat of liver of sulphur.	8.623641624178141
All soil like that without dung.	12.39342202401345
Household slops.	16.58211792698403
Loam, what is this that is?	20.995417077102523
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	17.136018763672755
Mulch of dung.	14.734401266318299
Best thing to clean ladies’ kid gloves.	12.850823358665226
Dirty cleans.	16.58211792698403
Ashes too.	5.167893237494866
Reclaim the whole place.	11.55681461732919
Grow peas in that corner there.	9.673818848499343
Lettuce.	32.13581597679176
Always have fresh greens then.	4.261963328418416
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	10.102177045409267
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	8.747943063179333
He walked on.	6.2943887622623915
Where is my hat, by the way?	28.44175896690079
Must have put it back on the peg.	39.05311810150237
Or hanging up on the floor.	7.633362199021948
Funny I don’t remember that.	8.764309140925723
Hallstand too full.	7.554588130286805
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	17.951584800072922
Picking up the letters.	12.01421806590867
Drago’s shopbell ringing.	24.25781657281104
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	9.092773209268037
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	19.131329180594683
Just had a wash and brushup.	20.657502822765498
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	11.762781717452851
Tara street.	5.9334534652198325
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	7.987340185634905
Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has.	9.640235394064895
Agendath what is it?	4.765872772309
Now, my miss.	15.767039189073081
Enthusiast.	32.13581597679176
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	14.863509254292802
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	13.93492273201345
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	27.34362077574746
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	6.782828835339037
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	10.681042105009128
The king was in his countinghouse.	26.991964955148045
Nobody.	22.281730317965827
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	15.491900078028163
Something new and easy.	11.406622102943356
No great hurry.	8.4492546945381
Keep it a bit.	13.203124981063048
Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_.	15.610370990989598
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London.	8.43716672596299
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	17.447273505535453
Three and a half.	23.104320738596737
Three pounds three.	12.267173033419523
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	6.122125512921573
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	8.943545952221378
Hope it’s not too big bring on piles again.	6.682961762095424
No, just right.	26.49450000792708
So. Ah! Costive.	18.438130219088396
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	7.082569710069092
Life might be so.	13.42995717934482
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	14.516543198221257
Print anything now.	4.429616469187592
Silly season.	16.58211792698403
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	18.760772438028127
Neat certainly.	11.725328032605423
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	12.5810947398106
Begins and ends morally.	8.55639188197318
_Hand in hand_.	9.70564496856689
Smart.	32.13581597679176
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	13.087517432460844
Might manage a sketch.	8.55639188197318

Invent a story for some proverb.	14.197153187315322
Which?	22.281730317965827
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	15.725512094721369
Dislike dressing together.	6.576650952291391
Nicked myself shaving.	11.148858409578036
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	8.37613346018242
Timing her.	5.297514951622471
9.15.	7.280421352089334
Did Roberts pay you yet?	8.15711262413999
9.20.	7.280421352089334
What had Gretta Conroy on?	9.980003968332298
9.23.	7.280421352089334
What possessed me to buy this comb?	17.146847145393043
9.24.	7.280421352089334
I’m swelled after that cabbage.	17.14236949441056
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	16.170687429216706
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	6.911749177536173
Morning after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the hours.	16.186598999074917
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	16.568489871266323
Washing her teeth.	11.475226020742946
That was the first night.	18.22572316681199
Her fansticks clicking.	11.148858409578036
Is that Boylan well off?	13.198297032300136
He has money.	13.714991548795956
Why?	12.497976142926124
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	16.490786756377787
No use humming then.	7.678703005418613
Allude to it.	4.538148138509351
Strange kind of music that last night.	9.99687544944419
The mirror was in shadow.	18.241554714784606
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	7.2297853258577565
Peering into it.	4.596421568079402
Lines in her eyes.	6.82389510955056
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.	10.80588007429534
Evening hours, girls in grey gauze.	14.287251020993013
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	4.688824754206254
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	18.13694144830093
Still, true to life also.	12.068743228171984
Day: then the night.	9.128115353959881
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	5.604279109643138
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	10.763658818955813
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	15.040193330928242
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	19.763585905295177
What time is the funeral?	16.010832292376474
Better find out in the paper.	16.00930638350927
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	15.633512551060713
The bells of George’s church.	8.219228374395431
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	8.702502065651242
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	2.6072767950770928
There again: the overtone following through the air.	10.31175430495011
A third.	16.58211792698403
Poor Dignam! [ 5 ] By lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past Windmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.	8.46143366548805
Could have given that address too.	6.147268604342003
And past the sailors’ home.	12.035372648362516
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	17.66383127004567
By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	13.052450432580137
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	7.891018530836772
Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.	16.39790087880246
O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of roses.	31.262533754886377
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	5.949857990637068
Come home to ma, da.	18.024249022349295
Slack hour: won’t be many there.	7.4497646937208595
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	16.8172501676653
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	11.76410324428125
And past Nichols’ the undertaker.	10.004769267141597
At eleven it is.	4.797252748298179
Time enough.	11.943845981129963
Singing with his eyes shut.	12.902456815920626
Corny.	32.13581597679176
Met her once in the park.	11.613511344750272
In the dark.	14.252994497799454
What a lark.	14.65971381891122
Police tout.	16.58211792698403
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	9.059764458010502
O, surely he bagged it.	6.937225295081254
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	17.784916997507825
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	5.36073266026311
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	6.40264144501689
Rather warm.	11.089130599646298
Tea.	20.244295502353957
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	12.419854746466536
Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though.	23.539821560586898
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	8.56583815608293
Very warm morning.	5.810797357552968
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	8.342813733111385
Just there.	5.52737264232801
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	16.246655020167655
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	8.561460549796276
So warm.	11.089130599646298
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	8.957295592436191
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	19.51267408500211
The far east.	8.4492546945381
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	6.7372792201085465
Wonder is it like that.	11.962950663626357
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand’s turn all day.	11.990159863649565
Sleep six months out of twelve.	13.58842060137769
Too hot to quarrel.	9.645223575437983
Influence of the climate.	46.28117993514938
Lethargy.	32.13581597679176
Flowers of idleness.	11.148858409578036
The air feeds most.	11.535784605995017
Azotes.	32.13581597679176
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	7.124763581548046
Sensitive plants.	13.943843522115227
Waterlilies.	32.13581597679176
Petals too tired to.	5.949092050151644
Sleeping sickness in the air.	10.169085928048844
Walk on roseleaves.	14.786396833216765
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	13.976797882979897
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	31.24152128120144
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	21.754717591518776
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	11.144795343295351
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	27.58564629768861
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	13.82553011320236
It’s a law something like that.	8.514602553259673
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	6.682645455241974
The college curriculum.	9.70564496856689
Cracking curriculum.	13.943843522115227
What is weight really when you say the weight?	21.441427669067373
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	4.728119987625914
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	5.169007288245158
They all fall to the ground.	10.753916717640855
The earth.	11.992428326154721
It’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	25.842463808716253
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	13.704575519550746
How did she walk with her sausages?	19.92875656908776
Like that something.	21.924977268731116
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	12.925415951423066
Careless air: just drop in to see.	10.719808858001112
Per second per second.	6.327585443752556
Per second for every second it means.	10.49591346976939
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	19.215249705905894
Too late box.	17.7644442851617
Post here.	5.839984039894037
No-one.	6.293544309231302
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	20.84136686129838
—Are there any letters for me?	12.913939380490971
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	10.340218035175573
No answer probably.	6.576650952291391
Went too far last time.	6.101468826260244
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	19.92739470690345
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	14.549769298423897
Henry Flower Esq, c/o P.	4.459943504663317
Westland Row, City.	10.960493113210834
Answered anyhow.	8.291058963492015
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	7.480149865662712
Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?	30.869323667953434
Castoff soldier.	16.58211792698403
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	9.211656835963057
No, he’s a grenadier.	26.020334600759632
Pointed cuffs.	12.599684944605478
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	10.433482208192435
Redcoats.	32.13581597679176
Too showy.	16.58211792698403
That must be why the women go after them.	13.422642688642792
Uniform.	32.13581597679176
Easier to enlist and drill.	6.4148509902083335
Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	15.91829528630999
Griffith’s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	9.468492807074208
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	7.167642060954763
Mark time.	5.672954291597353
Table: able.	11.148858409578036
Bed: ed.	11.148858409578036
The King’s own.	18.440079548519318
A mason, yes.	5.25126214756393
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	12.906415033328747
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	15.562698532788634
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	18.263387583980336
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think.	7.519312224281061
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	9.678553199857312
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	8.022821841859292
Hair?	32.13581597679176
No. M’Coy.	16.90498330902296
Get rid of him quickly.	16.282551046997437
Take me out of my way.	10.84389221338281
Hate company when you.	7.793809657895674
—Hello, Bloom.	5.1148614776105195
Where are you off to?	26.12930337973893
—Hello, M’Coy.	9.230578933227987
Nowhere in particular.	10.820317394403332
—How’s the body?	31.73201446253492
—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.	4.30241031015184
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: —Is there any...	14.996214854210002
no trouble I hope?	17.721138192069
—O, no, Mr Bloom said.	6.1206611581092565
Poor Dignam, you know.	14.573221079237
The funeral is today.	4.522114276990975
—To be sure, poor fellow.	9.360071745169382
So it is.	6.207093956394691
What time?	11.029822407684417
A photo it isn’t.	5.662010454042656
A badge maybe.	9.70564496856689
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	16.586513568536176
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said.	12.755897375002482
Eleven, is it?	5.568237344395895
Who was telling me?	6.663853890911756
Holohan.	32.13581597679176
You know Hoppy?	24.870879440204675
—I know.	10.444921885364204
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	23.91604642019948
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	10.826247043826713
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	18.47537488713587
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	16.351396687950686
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	16.951493147031503
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	15.753520979125765
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	11.551754615839355
Handsome is and handsome does.	6.236313947861035
Reserved about to yield.	18.513228906818494
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	7.0289695697446355
Possess her once take the starch out of her.	7.840831625286586
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	19.84857672356855
Just down there in Conway’s we were.	21.501962642375414
Doran Lyons in Conway’s.	5.170499462670643
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	12.748815885239306
In came Hoppy.	14.786396833216765
Having a wet.	12.82704132222452
Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.	14.51289303927026
Clearly I can see today.	9.448921616613704
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	4.131327230923143
Talking of one thing or another.	7.257426894043325
Lady’s hand.	9.367537915263238
Which side will she get up?	6.736108799404557
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I said.	10.146869760478753
_Poor little Paddy Dignam_, he said.	4.431422370744135
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	17.687695336501605
High brown boots with laces dangling.	6.724069982302605
Wellturned foot.	9.85978631029179
What is he foostering over that change for?	13.395607826226174
Sees me looking.	12.938273209511474
Eye out for other fellow always.	16.233512487528536
Good fallback.	16.58211792698403
Two strings to her bow.	12.292957467746193
—_Why?_ I said.	5.42020966408128
_What’s wrong with him?_ I said.	13.671014409247004
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	4.597859695725158
He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head.	15.485909024760797
Getting up in a minute.	13.48695258002195
—_What’s wrong with him_?	14.74659481734431
He said.	8.467571453076141
_He’s dead_, he said.	7.545724367884117
And, faith, he filled up.	14.797126299763175
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	13.698634017152093
I said.	4.216005791797964
I couldn’t believe it when I heard it.	15.549963155877858
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	14.6874403542856
_He’s gone.	11.213702443429103
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	27.325301373127758
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	5.914256797080897
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	9.558781169750409
Lost it.	4.258023366747632
Curse your noisy pugnose.	10.82639741088797
Feels locked out of it.	4.585328916152403
Paradise and the peri.	29.59036270144484
Always happening like that.	4.906751761991351
The very moment.	11.99015734771016
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	7.249594456942565
Her friend covering the display of.	5.453259273164273
_Esprit de corps_.	11.148858409578036
Well, what are you gaping at?	17.276798857781092
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	10.478936051059806
Another gone.	7.746137034861855
—One of the best, M’Coy said.	6.5484181026718575
The tram passed.	8.080465848484218
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	15.425557333807454
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	16.479697817832758
—Wife well, I suppose?	15.261585437616613
M’Coy’s changed voice said.	7.829254524656776
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	4.956355161211825
Tiptop, thanks.	6.806654094191331
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree’s Potted Meat?	7.098937301892615
Incomplete.	22.281730317965827
—My missus has just got an engagement.	8.434431876637367
At least it’s not settled yet.	11.336670320575777
Valise tack again.	4.883734682030202
By the way no harm.	8.937650520267622
I’m off that, thanks.	11.848868843630175
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	12.929432410186141
—My wife too, he said.	8.025933823297246
She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	20.321045736450724
—That so?	9.445642156049578
M’Coy said.	3.2561573329766187
Glad to hear that, old man.	12.15392333413117
Who’s getting it up?	14.31758138773595
Not up yet.	6.674853365842211
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	23.947004403998985
No book.	8.909322665144582
Letter.	32.13581597679176
Cat furry black ball.	6.347442741854127
Torn strip of envelope.	9.265860191790876
Love’s Old Sweet Song Comes lo-ove’s old...	7.535925074617015
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	12.61159438953978
_Sweeeet song_.	16.58211792698403
There’s a committee formed.	18.41040405663051
Part shares and part profits.	5.217715084143799
M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	16.169296778987636
—O, well, he said.	7.145125519090081
That’s good news.	17.995392992396358
He moved to go.	15.723603179407007
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	5.920766202754204
Meet you knocking around.	7.124763581548046
—Tell you what, M’Coy said.	5.738773026833928
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	15.589382917753374
I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see.	12.33065256513526
There’s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	12.17320032741985
You just shove in my name if I’m not there, will you?	16.61341060336067
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	10.994530118256256
That’ll be all right.	5.384188536640565
—Right, M’Coy said brightly.	10.271493425582111
Thanks, old man.	6.344042516127897
I’d go if I possibly could.	16.4708356162419
Well, tolloll.	31.64221603700983
Just C.	6.817466119191894
P.	8.450228160453479
M’Coy will do.	10.745492022060171
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	17.326657542886387
Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze.	8.926827094567283
The quick touch.	7.791124599957709
Soft mark.	12.599684944605478
I’d like my job.	15.03783088155052
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	12.07015996330294
Leather.	32.13581597679176
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	4.96635755534808
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	18.548335089347223
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	12.884160365822048
My missus has just got an.	7.616259841819281
Reedy freckled soprano.	9.70564496856689
Cheeseparing nose.	9.105249025485831
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	20.921138145870213
No guts in it.	5.284386786998173
You and me, don’t you know: in the same boat.	21.42809724301455
Softsoaping.	32.13581597679176
Give you the needle that would.	13.20458954738218
Can’t he hear the difference?	21.688024444342886
Think he’s that way inclined a bit.	15.029032670643373
Against my grain somehow.	7.622878559556313
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	3.1734587097290934
I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.	10.586095783355647
Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again.	6.175232839850305
Your wife and my wife.	15.360874263264613
Wonder is he pimping after me?	16.637465693206003
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	26.20490060995941
Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	5.722448374050734
Clery’s Summer Sale.	24.25781657281104
No, he’s going on straight.	18.64331444582886
Hello.	16.067907988395877
_Leah_ tonight.	13.626029315150411
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	8.860608804869138
Like to see her again in that.	17.517675122683432
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	4.61180788725943
Male impersonator.	16.58211792698403
Perhaps he was a woman.	11.752019374750503
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	8.55639188197318
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	9.467399809358387
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	10.759633512324005
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	32.859063814346506
And Ristori in Vienna.	8.55639188197318
What is this the right name is?	23.607815675871265
Rachel, is it?	4.400727130390941
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	16.38947103766894
Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	22.091604109912527
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	10.650994102004177
Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face.	11.26021497508912
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	10.458191941217622
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	20.155358119481726
No use thinking of it any more.	17.63533735045535
Nosebag time.	5.672954291597353
Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow.	9.042827000097814
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	9.680194268050453
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	12.62218431327684
Their Eldorado.	16.58211792698403
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	9.912343741080898
Too full for words.	4.65484632043177
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	20.34792357122414
Might be happy all the same that way.	12.959933120351312
Good poor brutes they look.	7.172071192384885
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	8.518774243498672
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	20.606694838384744
Might just walk into her here.	6.106654991865926
The lane is safer.	8.55639188197318
He passed the cabman’s shelter.	20.93609233239319
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	9.219055078283592
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	10.832745485815552
_Voglio e non_.	11.576843182705467
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	16.479438320982233
Sociable.	32.13581597679176
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	12.518551296048786
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	5.486794520881352
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	29.92312103076263
No-one.	6.293544309231302
Meade’s timberyard.	36.40397348016953
Piled balks.	16.58211792698403
Ruins and tenements.	11.148858409578036
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	9.309002025370761
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	6.666614715360799
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	11.365740534463924
Pity to disturb them.	5.702729507240002
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	10.757875099739174
Open it.	4.258023366747632
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s school.	15.613820175825651
She liked mignonette.	11.148858409578036
Mrs Ellis’s.	5.370145232280811
And Mr?	23.60097507926347
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	26.686648211420195
A flower.	11.725328032605423
I think it’s a.	19.191265429848837
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	8.747943063179333
Not annoyed then?	7.184257632960914
What does she say?	18.241556825383043
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	13.290103329074803
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	29.426137345573895
Why did you enclose the stamps?	13.791791809108515
I am awfully angry with you.	7.873275354277819
I do wish I could punish you for that.	8.513097360020788
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	4.6748599771447505
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	16.710861286820286
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	5.126934527825768
I do wish I could do something for you.	9.544436262997282
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	14.043267211177119
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	21.113041755606705
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	16.567851891082537
I think of you so often you have no idea.	24.415678134854573
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	13.945306187152267
I feel so bad about.	12.318947306902063
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	15.273163426264027
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	12.86867447352073
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	21.809621753410877
O how I long to meet you.	9.778157367158705
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	8.26534269291948
Then I will tell you all.	6.393405481965622
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	16.33104315129852
today.	10.711938658930588
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	5.987904433199842
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	9.5743371972415
I want to know.	10.600357245881012
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	8.30058155206229
Language of flowers.	17.7644442851617
They like it because no-one can hear.	10.823921742410022
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	12.284790695686674
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	10.707937484254815
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume.	5.529148639259441
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	23.00669021697782
Weak joy opened his lips.	6.104158520175053
Changed since the first letter.	19.768463309897154
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	17.203411358303324
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	7.75417436300532
Thank you: not having any.	17.234616374458916
Usual love scrimmage.	11.148858409578036
Then running round corners.	9.265860191790876
Bad as a row with Molly.	15.341392725452458
Cigar has a cooling effect.	11.519843604823418
Narcotic.	32.13581597679176
Go further next time.	4.030509328174743
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	8.502059009327345
Brutal, why not?	9.153959672330487
Try it anyhow.	6.983164666998037
A bit at a time.	6.858363402224286
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	12.435777713772573
Common pin, eh?	7.586580549496008
He threw it on the road.	12.531440268538702
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	10.230093435706616
Queer the number of pins they always have.	7.81646085905204
No roses without thorns.	8.55639188197318
Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head.	5.802753759950736
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	17.08734611577014
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	11.29374197770966
She didn’t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	5.186242808384355
It?	32.13581597679176
Such a bad headache.	10.801436512200727
Has her roses probably.	5.511493857370463
Or sitting all day typing.	12.174389731164593
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	8.15711262413999
What perfume does your wife use.	4.809057478700453
Now could you make out a thing like that?	9.89665288646237
To keep it up.	4.0131996867906015
Martha, Mary.	30.485154050353856
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	7.8688235661859744
He is sitting in their house, talking.	38.18743779617544
Mysterious.	32.13581597679176
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	23.389577250024026
To keep it up.	4.0131996867906015
Nice kind of evening feeling.	17.024688790701596
No more wandering about.	8.961727349563276
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	6.044734432732454
Forget.	32.13581597679176
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	11.324091198722137
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	14.867537492424074
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	18.723690710780986
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	6.591690268879404
Tell her: more and more: all.	12.42776744263172
Long long long rest.	8.530241785901962
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	8.482516867594885
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	15.380676675990902
Henry Flower.	32.90353673118972
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	22.318013202413972
Simple bit of paper.	10.933527503611517
Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a million in the bank of Ireland.	9.07418708758432
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	9.557450078367005
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	6.4148509902083335
A million pounds, wait a moment.	10.05609486927184
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	8.075827199539884
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	6.582649433970959
Yes, exactly.	33.573038484498824
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	10.06762001311815
What am I saying barrels?	10.942481552856682
Gallons.	32.13581597679176
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	6.564183505408269
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	8.419774584664848
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	14.610528780897324
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	16.078793614934398
Damn it.	6.060353919085306
I might have tried to work M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	22.775069945404166
Same notice on the door.	11.759203463547745
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	5.065806343315331
on saint Peter Claver S.	2.9924284680455084
and the African Mission.	30.315068979748837
Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	16.92947307119254
The protestants are the same.	9.598002780928914
Convert Dr William J.	5.204789004610139
Walsh D.D. to the true religion.	32.07834054310483
Save China’s millions.	23.939344502441422
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	16.007490276203463
Prefer an ounce of opium.	8.033053861831862
Celestials.	32.13581597679176
Rank heresy for them.	4.3526937332296125
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	20.795893644811574
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	9.479694648657185
Josssticks burning.	13.943843522115227
Not like Ecce Homo.	12.116599241714928
Crown of thorns and cross.	5.483102864076354
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	8.104825326171756
Chopsticks?	32.13581597679176
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	15.485365855838182
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.	11.046494546344993
They’re taught that.	7.640060021197329
He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	15.064211838537211
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	9.446015687257564
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	12.776157677260963
Still life.	6.267451463649378
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	13.647050611761179
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	6.676329412438455
Something going on: some sodality.	16.850430854175755
Pity so empty.	9.70564496856689
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	11.80775336448121
Who is my neighbour?	40.30423550059478
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	14.062187550860598
That woman at midnight mass.	12.405431681345863
Seventh heaven.	9.573690248878348
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	8.42704244679547
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	14.179197577133182
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	17.836939778503588
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	10.997397681902397
Her hat and head sank.	17.73611541186592
Then the next one.	8.281542335224962
Her hat sank at once.	5.682924610158373
Then the next one: a small old woman.	22.00603554361431
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	17.820745791204338
Latin.	20.244295502353957
The next one.	5.360407719055297
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	7.601736620762672
_Corpus:_ body.	21.128431842091228
Good idea the Latin.	11.903653148734897
Stupefies them first.	7.540198132695
Hospice for the dying.	33.81429488780579
They don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	7.8640253385982595
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	15.1897528949563
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	4.181105654162411
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	9.94987858399828
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	13.023829391691924
These pots we have to wear.	17.028941864190205
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	8.811943182646214
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	19.592947349864666
Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	13.499581992154399
Look at them.	15.148855652546416
Now I bet it makes them feel happy.	13.243517293518599
It does.	15.713579045204575
Yes, bread of angels it’s called.	22.296018464500566
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	19.21048427156446
First communicants.	16.58211792698403
Hokypoky penny a lump.	9.881447583615618
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	18.08073579774777
They do.	7.415748579130837
I’m sure of that.	9.71051893383014
Not so lonely.	15.147112134211074
In our confraternity.	11.148858409578036
Then come out a bit spreeish.	34.54777310746358
Let off steam.	11.148858409578036
Thing is if you really believe in it.	6.10946501485775
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	8.667623234039935
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	5.636211105707435
Hence those snores.	11.148858409578036
Blind faith.	9.324810169522841
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	16.183562157553112
Lulls all pain.	8.080465848484218
Wake this time next year.	10.929260865141895
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	15.882121874791896
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	9.338733986143302
He wouldn’t know what to do to.	9.135162325902227
Bald spot behind.	6.7825679092034745
Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her.	20.910171827865614
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	15.355665436287905
And the other one?	31.48447673416227
Iron nails ran in.	4.472921952985524
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	7.575015643327513
Do not deny my request.	10.62185485102048
Dusk and the light behind her.	21.77117690105008
She might be here with a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly.	23.510025802222177
Their character.	9.324810169522841
That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	17.876518499007354
This very church.	10.333135095970073
Peter Carey, yes.	6.082309149825239
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	33.33379741873968
Denis Carey.	16.58211792698403
And just imagine that.	8.848714368217864
Wife and six children at home.	7.403434820132154
And plotting that murder all the time.	5.304889931301552
Those crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking about them.	12.912767893474786
They’re not straight men of business either.	8.428141600079597
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no.	9.082730943685105
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	17.608448282353084
Yes: under the bridge.	22.806423327743847
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	16.891946919496466
Wine.	25.50621404370786
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic).	10.159524178709832
Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	13.716808708941775
Cold comfort.	16.58211792698403
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	6.782065506816708
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	20.368589024796226
Quite right.	6.760847130337436
Perfectly right that is.	4.8978765005502085
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	55.360439129191654
Not going to be any music.	11.960608093877084
Pity.	22.281730317965827
Who has the organ here I wonder?	23.755567591107035
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	11.133370202758167
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	24.8712412695518
Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first.	9.879197270048271
Christ or Pilate?	11.148858409578036
Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it.	12.919551576813575
Music they wanted.	11.869655286702958
Footdrill stopped.	9.573690248878348
Could hear a pin drop.	11.887043879645557
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	9.462141498849306
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est homo._ Some of that old sacred music splendid.	21.134848038763014
Mercadante: seven last words.	4.104419002732159
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	8.61824031756784
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	9.91671553678904
Palestrina for example too.	7.38135760082083
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	12.580243791283495
Benedictine.	32.13581597679176
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	25.386252693851638
What kind of voice is it?	13.993245149188123
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	15.837946086691359
Connoisseurs.	32.13581597679176
Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.	7.905779765541528
Kind of a placid.	27.982280672032747
No worry.	13.943843522115227
Fall into flesh, don’t they?	6.895020479124564
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	8.92603991679288
Who knows?	11.787611917640778
Eunuch.	32.13581597679176
One way out of it.	8.00182164724609
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	16.161784208520775
All crossed themselves and stood up.	5.81926668074714
Mr Bloom glanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats.	21.260383072573518
Stand up at the gospel of course.	15.257980460668517
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	15.664262343671805
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	20.454513611100506
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: —O God, our refuge and our strength...	12.395371235584204
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	17.69842186512898
English.	20.244295502353957
Throw them the bone.	13.09543740367485
I remember slightly.	18.84860199560054
How long since your last mass?	15.494216080823717
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	6.791212737248195
Joseph, her spouse.	11.808262129976102
Peter and Paul.	9.70564496856689
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	18.855577955382042
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	6.941465400243283
Confession.	32.13581597679176
Everyone wants to.	7.497150935147164
Then I will tell you all.	6.393405481965622
Penance.	32.13581597679176
Punish me, please.	14.558899104243356
Great weapon in their hands.	8.515719962974645
More than doctor or solicitor.	7.082569710069092
Woman dying to.	9.076116477297878
And I schschschschschsch.	21.434076424131987
And did you chachachachacha?	18.513228906818494
And why did you?	14.718316318856457
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	17.680435481730143
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	4.551469731814324
Husband learn to his surprise.	19.455470641016007
God’s little joke.	21.745869147450023
Then out she comes.	8.279211252996465
Repentance skindeep.	16.58211792698403
Pray at an altar.	11.695655343542443
Hail Mary and Holy Mary.	12.210261620413673
Flowers, incense, candles melting.	7.3326503106833325
Hide her blushes.	11.148858409578036
Salvation army blatant imitation.	8.55639188197318
Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	6.27891609374865
How I found the Lord.	12.56569724382669
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	13.482871186842939
And don’t they rake in the money too?	22.53466331144825
Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	16.81809665318542
Monasteries and convents.	9.70564496856689
No browbeating him.	3.871661339954168
He had his answer pat for everything.	13.923864940051526
Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church.	9.083032534121196
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	11.774269566640703
The priest prayed: —Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	9.973209027578571
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	15.1745200252662
All over.	7.145629591813955
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	8.747943063179333
Better be shoving along.	10.475680930706165
Brother Buzz.	12.599684944605478
Come around with the plate perhaps.	11.959251858355207
Pay your Easter duty.	8.279211252996465
He stood up.	5.7863006764245775
Hello.	16.067907988395877
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	14.202417227733855
Women enjoy it.	3.757377520435574
Never tell you.	4.428321051961038
But we.	19.72397270152566
Excuse, miss, there’s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	10.13774057254348
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	7.874244312418092
Glimpses of the moon.	13.299556143267564
Annoyed if you don’t.	7.365367838991009
Why didn’t you tell me before.	11.777033845340219
Still like you better untidy.	12.76058203136771
Good job it wasn’t farther south.	12.556689937510146
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	12.938991014877843
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	14.087862938833437
Trams: a car of Prescott’s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	23.46312898218812
Notice because I’m in mourning myself.	9.677206828707412
He covered himself.	7.221075026994251
How goes the time?	7.774743204127173
Quarter past.	9.324810169522841
Time enough yet.	11.475226020742946
Better get that lotion made up.	13.707569831038834
Where is this?	21.08898611348586
Ah yes, the last time.	17.239644954190773
Sweny’s in Lincoln place.	12.113520837586194
Chemists rarely move.	8.4492546945381
Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.	10.98994648127602
Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of the flood.	19.604757768383838
Huguenot churchyard near there.	5.204789004610139
Visit some day.	9.360292465827968
He walked southward along Westland row.	9.440525331196023
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	24.589549646425414
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	18.65018334841158
Bore this funeral affair.	9.014958998660607
O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault.	19.316385638701924
When was it I got it made up last?	28.88285268117268
I changed a sovereign I remember.	9.892870376715411
First of the month it must have been or the second.	19.459130902760407
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	27.7539671696512
The chemist turned back page after page.	6.230043996796445
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	6.404856064803889
Shrunken skull.	10.595029903244942
And old.	12.959306904414468

Why?	12.497976142926124

Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	8.500603240282352
—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	5.247577383042064
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	8.570599364878534
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	14.199132778768181
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	22.36390317336787
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	7.194411455905688
Skinfood.	32.13581597679176
One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it?	12.642815290089388

Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	16.64829692144869
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	11.140594010613487
Also I think I.	7.860852600105423
Yes I.	5.909382163877581
Do it in the bath.	18.375569948935944
Curious longing I.	4.883734682030202
Water to water.	5.95504205364476
Combine business with pleasure.	7.988708651301034
Pity no time for massage.	15.58689254725735
Feel fresh then all the day.	8.207336653678237
Funeral be rather glum.	7.622878559556313
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	4.671391927436129
That was two and nine.	13.647526065209375
Have you brought a bottle?	33.72163347753953
—No, Mr Bloom said.	3.567130678681989
Make it up, please.	13.958492482821606
I’ll call later in the day and I’ll take one of these soaps.	22.55922381562677
How much are they?	11.810166852626947
—Fourpence, sir.	3.9643324688742196
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	15.731947198926248
Sweet lemony wax.	8.949652011548354
—I’ll take this one, he said.	6.473495073038772
That makes three and a penny.	17.147552390315525
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	4.671391927436129
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	14.595608913904739
—Good, Mr Bloom said.	5.792349873044187
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	19.56949933461306
At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said: —Hello, Bloom.	10.238873681499847
What’s the best news?	10.13947231539477
Is that today’s?	23.678148759766326
Show us a minute.	20.33542264449682
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	11.40895174328502
To look younger.	9.70564496856689
He does look balmy.	12.116599241714928
Younger than I am.	11.34858339266478
Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	14.033478155492823
Wants a wash too.	5.5696738731967566
Take off the rough dirt.	23.933229088221868
Good morning, have you used Pears’ soap?	10.875493560206767
Dandruff on his shoulders.	14.708925076965626
Scalp wants oiling.	11.148858409578036
—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	11.535655977998628
Where the bugger is it?	6.60382882907763
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	8.139210965117606
Barber’s itch.	39.76832468340524
Tight collar he’ll lose his hair.	9.079040538325723
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	9.420367570511015
—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	8.039797605859038
—Ascot.	16.58211792698403
Gold cup.	10.411942184745959
Half a mo.	14.734401266318299
Maximum the second.	14.76126416094522
—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	7.812287338661538
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	13.29082560667033
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
his sharp voice said.	2.9818945638638663
—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	17.212411021456298
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.	11.488332109047755
—I’ll risk it, he said.	7.134007517051631
Here, thanks.	15.691541324834178
He sped off towards Conway’s corner.	7.185175024310083
God speed scut.	12.872306092276881
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	16.699858841000943
Silly lips of that chap.	27.314796680027925
Betting.	32.13581597679176
Regular hotbed of it lately.	15.163639947163714

Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	5.946783646404766
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	5.140206045246131
Keeps a hotel now.	3.9649444280784425
They never come back.	8.897865541457259
Fleshpots of Egypt.	19.391350588187112
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	27.977082999839606
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	16.31436224235546
College sports today I see.	6.763286462807784
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	10.593276032726923
Damn bad ad.	8.080465848484218
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	29.75424415982834
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	8.287301307723801
Something to catch the eye.	8.446563637229275
There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge.	24.016757271050253
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	15.576325002994434
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	15.867510311796032
Heavenly weather really.	6.901633021014249
If life was always like that.	8.235353404832425
Cricket weather.	11.725328032605423
Sit around under sunshades.	7.622878559556313
Over after over.	5.685266147648296
Out.	22.281730317965827
They can’t play it here.	6.517826309753446
Duck for six wickets.	10.82639741088797
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	9.550907358100359
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	14.642273137535708
And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the floor.	11.364231958686776
Heatwave.	32.13581597679176
Won’t last.	19.398727947235027
Always passing, the stream of life, which in the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.	9.006067122593882
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	10.17294317521799
This is my body.	31.99063433955647
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	10.697368399723413
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	11.35492429694964
[ 6 ] Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	12.971146297046
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	10.70775236077236
—After you, Mr Bloom said.	5.8904318949188665
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: —Yes, yes.	15.569391425517377
—Are we all here now?	15.989030556753438
Martin Cunningham asked.	10.170375808260331
Come along, Bloom.	8.831138275212211
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	29.532214737819356
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	11.796697754739105
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	15.68620332866
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	11.993930490331362
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	16.02965936384294
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	11.726447824332602
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	13.716348720733079
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	9.515472206578714
Job seems to suit them.	6.0862859391686115
Huggermugger in corners.	8.080465848484218
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d wake.	8.50367698506189
Then getting it ready.	8.760543903616691
Laying it out.	6.881716661886867
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	9.337940611157348
Pull it more to your side.	15.184359110153542
Our windingsheet.	12.599684944605478
Never know who will touch you dead.	9.141224825306706
Wash and shampoo.	11.148858409578036
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	13.970971444721911
Keep a bit in an envelope.	23.83526306421617
Grows all the same after.	14.449963859341134
Unclean job.	8.909322665144582
All waited.	9.712135624511834
Nothing was said.	4.345796531477561
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	16.514558269930593
I am sitting on something hard.	16.087346288873228
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	35.060718810085696
Better shift it out of that.	5.66898031253064
Wait for an opportunity.	27.527975593893785
All waited.	9.712135624511834
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs.	10.246711445447078
A jolt.	16.58211792698403
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	11.12435726155187
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	9.143960441988943
At walking pace.	12.267173033419523
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	16.004988062301774
Tritonville road.	11.992428326154721
Quicker.	32.13581597679176
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	13.780577831113009
—What way is he taking us?	22.579844221480265
Mr Power asked through both windows.	8.888567849249162
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	2.606963729247433
Ringsend.	32.13581597679176
Brunswick street.	11.045865395615886
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	12.223074319259087
—That’s a fine old custom, he said.	6.168105479029006
I am glad to see it has not died out.	15.651484895861694
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	5.821651102127044
Respect.	32.13581597679176
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	18.80102831626593
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	8.298503072888948
—Who is that?	8.282934025737456
—Your son and heir.	17.629230191429446
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	12.076821017328216
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	9.955222050023568
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: —Was that Mulligan cad with him?	18.073178090130202
His _fidus Achates_! —No, Mr Bloom said.	5.58268817759147
He was alone.	17.589279053854323
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	18.461548273718098
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	8.131894904483678
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	7.216179363145407
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	41.327452264200076
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	8.983702204370905
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	10.65498217888351
Great card he was.	7.73885634873165
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.	12.809433830215719
Out on the rampage all night.	15.30830572397579
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	23.704007115861653
Wife ironing his back.	5.277409504723383
Thinks he’ll cure it with pills.	13.455226193843671
All breadcrumbs they are.	6.0533171231034855
About six hundred per cent profit.	10.886284035956425
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	72.16738227360834
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	10.210070114932666
His name stinks all over Dublin.	12.818324587100369
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	18.499860993379848
I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	5.506236726575048
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: —I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	11.339129892315935
A counterjumper’s son.	8.870015585463426
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s.	11.36938321582179
Not likely.	10.269333115996188
He ceased.	16.688409521161915
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	20.222275032993007
Noisy selfwilled man.	5.119071363328073
Full of his son.	20.975021413123347
He is right.	13.937537050260646
Something to hand on.	17.297107688914355
If little Rudy had lived.	8.95636601590391
See him grow up.	5.194156006803547
Hear his voice in the house.	12.983983012893772
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	9.362839579916102
My son.	11.458079205252007
Me in his eyes.	7.054374891265032
Strange feeling it would be.	9.912679526185327
From me.	6.777985144107338
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	21.058309691850756
And the sergeant grinning up.	7.569341078144219
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	15.906577150826667
Give us a touch, Poldy.	18.06611769974768
God, I’m dying for it.	6.951306755606589
How life begins.	9.70564496856689
Got big then.	5.475411844292782
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	7.316524124689606
My son inside her.	7.9470331594816
I could have helped him on in life.	13.713735538032092
I could.	19.661128013834677
Make him independent.	19.61075504569421
Learn German too.	4.387016086573923
—Are we late?	19.166125444351728
Mr Power asked.	6.642329128150424
Molly.	14.916124459691183
Milly.	25.50621404370786
Same thing watered down.	6.0150255824676435
Her tomboy oaths.	11.148858409578036
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl.	3.0698452387057635
Soon be a woman.	14.989264258575878
Mullingar.	18.793139189616713
Dearest Papli.	14.45922143842678
Yes, yes: a woman too.	15.995165157052078
Life, life.	11.161868617477724
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	18.10800931365951
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	5.744912221362323
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him.	24.778995119669908
Do you follow me?	7.77046025855316
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	12.331854441956947
—What is this, he said, in the name of God?	17.986478535760654
Crumbs?	32.13581597679176
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	6.433008496822461
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	9.565406576294475
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: —Unless I’m greatly mistaken.	14.64164273147329
What do you think, Martin?	13.21929300073537
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	7.296217472000161
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	19.983514943720355
Glad I took that bath.	13.55160658371545
Feel my feet quite clean.	10.879715630402368
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	8.246746288901617
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	21.12375656402184
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.	10.760762873006074
—Did Tom Kernan turn up?	16.003362041949128
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	11.67345333995246
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	7.781268128390221
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	17.97330093233463
—And Corny Kelleher himself?	24.63869611028699
Mr Power asked.	6.642329128150424
—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	5.437980661728484
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	10.241403923424375
He said he’d try to come.	10.775957947734108
The carriage halted short.	13.191130679373142
—What’s wrong?	22.309514528436374
—We’re stopped.	13.60573591630393
—Where are we?	17.874473430017936
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	17.056886068713787
—The grand canal, he said.	5.187980583157751
Gasworks.	32.13581597679176
Whooping cough they say it cures.	15.02995005119529
Good job Milly never got it.	6.767640046320568
Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions.	7.4188108045725905
Shame really.	9.105249025485831
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	7.3326503106833325
Only measles.	16.58211792698403
Flaxseed tea.	9.573690248878348
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	8.55639188197318
Canvassing for death.	7.96852283160563
Don’t miss this chance.	12.037600098830424
Dogs’ home over there.	6.770908968056376
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	12.273801313642586
Thy will be done.	10.176397880997635
We obey them in the grave.	11.500796460557854
A dying scrawl.	11.148858409578036
He took it to heart, pined away.	20.707985686534244
Quiet brute.	13.943843522115227
Old men’s dogs usually are.	9.89264796266442
A raindrop spat on his hat.	6.273864478353774
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	20.34589256575471
Apart.	32.13581597679176
Curious.	32.13581597679176
Like through a colander.	17.161975212587343
I thought it would.	12.861799573610202
My boots were creaking I remember now.	5.1476779876631
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.	11.59921980110932
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	7.065991254691408
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	7.294571246986249
There’s the sun again coming out.	15.936108240272937
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	16.415390446746294
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.	10.587215682385512
—We’re off again.	8.00102735734926
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	6.817463976480308
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	12.147740915381593
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	6.301458208345737
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	14.81162611563848
—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	17.119156017211417
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	22.210334793512917
—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	8.74692896061381
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience._ —Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	17.336520738890876
He’s dead nuts on that.	7.792744679456167
And the retrospective arrangement.	19.51120946319678
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?	15.490911126591314
Martin Cunningham asked.	10.170375808260331
—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	59.527227696461885
Where is it?	10.944814356930452
—In the paper this morning.	13.650695973484261
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	28.591281948958528
That book I must change for her.	8.005303716062981
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	53.12923912143511
Later on please.	8.995516578411697
Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	7.324042927030642
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s?	21.842471966392925
no, Sexton, Urbright.	13.150195605799722
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	7.267368775914661
Thanks to the Little Flower.	23.648705147193795
Sadly missed.	16.58211792698403
To the inexpressible grief of his.	11.42959814697093
Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness.	19.720612983886067
Month’s mind: Quinlan.	16.716825149542604
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	7.602428839115537
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	12.183394642129771
I tore up the envelope?	25.471813305166947
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	20.543951111427827
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	10.82639741088797
There all right.	6.700773942224406
Before my patience are exhausted.	6.886190773545318
National school.	8.928586892958878
Meade’s yard.	16.472721400485444
The hazard.	13.943843522115227
Only two there now.	3.790503689443717
Nodding.	32.13581597679176
Full as a tick.	23.702304233696502
Too much bone in their skulls.	23.6758457261396
The other trotting round with a fare.	27.354461613546547
An hour ago I was passing there.	8.289844876209276
The jarvies raised their hats.	9.27765108429473
A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window.	8.669627964632035
Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	10.575225942519404
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	9.823944723327804
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	17.34877217771476
Antient concert rooms.	8.949652011548354
Nothing on there.	4.163582632477429
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	22.308353413516276
Not much grief there.	5.8250533499834765
Quarter mourning.	10.595029903244942
People in law perhaps.	5.037968642863577
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence.	13.094663644871073
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	19.370016620434967
I said I.	11.100374922587568
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	13.730731630129982
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	10.82639741088797
Big powerful change.	7.554588130286805
Wet bright bills for next week.	6.709282204544886
_Fun on the Bristol_.	31.480130803433042
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	26.99232441985014
Have to stand a drink or two.	12.016485271174238
As broad as it’s long.	13.521384973191376
He’s coming in the afternoon.	56.71504320339501
Her songs.	13.943843522115227
Plasto’s.	7.188455713234743
Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust.	12.669491323236164
Who was he?	19.04488834381945
—How do you do?	8.420916616175605
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	18.64723818476206
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.	7.82906843526322
Yes, he does.	37.93081950610266
How do you do?	7.105472475674715
—Who?	8.672134463555837
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	5.30382272750122
There he is airing his quiff.	12.493531773931263
Just that moment I was thinking.	12.744251755962079
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	18.706077602548817
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	13.100825198489776
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	25.55697896447025
The nails, yes.	6.644418781011872
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	22.38475444293248
Fascination.	32.13581597679176
Worst man in Dublin.	8.666949580602813
That keeps him alive.	5.663077265938942
They sometimes feel what a person is.	6.690065718367972
Instinct.	25.50621404370786
But a type like that.	6.660193194468177
My nails.	12.599684944605478
I am just looking at them: well pared.	19.428068402485835
And after: thinking alone.	7.002936862754004
Body getting a bit softy.	15.832008036657031
I would notice that: from remembering.	19.74191615074176
What causes that?	5.119071363328073
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	11.369162885182442
But the shape is there.	19.877972270205852
The shape is there still.	7.903460374485725
Shoulders.	32.13581597679176
Hips.	32.13581597679176
Plump.	32.13581597679176
Night of the dance dressing.	25.728466267275014
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.	9.454692466818527
He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.	11.870381452800066
Mr Power asked: —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	24.417469508618286
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	13.315464813131204
I hear great accounts of it.	6.435604276811731
It’s a good idea, you see...	7.8413787436401385
—Are you going yourself?	10.855732902146512
—Well no, Mr Bloom said.	5.756046626715386
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	17.888777143231977
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	18.13714270251087
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	16.68525621452246
—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said.	4.193411418701225
Mary Anderson is up there now.	6.946813957827112
Have you good artists?	28.53880062687164
—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	3.8164083123353385
O yes, we’ll have all topnobbers.	17.612004962878903
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	10.73525836634143
The best, in fact.	15.741018195865523
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	15.220059280266499
Last but not least.	11.643617159591164
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	12.875325972899306
Smith O’Brien.	20.607036984099814
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	5.1187063333069105
Woman.	20.244295502353957
Must be his deathday.	32.20397686891505
For many happy returns.	6.347442741854127
The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	7.5922119462130535
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	21.343450535727715
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	32.89943426226147
Had his office in Hume street.	5.016442913905987
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	9.214688557205632
Relics of old decency.	17.506043105851454
Mourning too.	5.167893237494866
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	6.866894741615206
O’Callaghan on his last legs.	26.14940132131613
And _Madame_.	23.60097507926347
Twenty past eleven.	7.355503433762563
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	14.578773717678668
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	6.624526304842121
No: _vorrei e non_.	9.006896584245164
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	23.549007870744617
_Mi trema un poco il_.	8.033053861831862
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	13.173972201121078
A thrush.	11.035116586329268
A throstle.	12.212364007875731
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	9.467740572836137
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face.	8.912107491878624
Greyish over the ears.	13.913470670211531
_Madame_: smiling.	7.355503433762563
I smiled back.	7.56660192710096
A smile goes a long way.	7.539057008757387
Only politeness perhaps.	5.9045683139513
Nice fellow.	8.909322665144582
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	28.260375123278088
Not pleasant for the wife.	11.943327617507382
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	25.207194935248292
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	10.497965586857502
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	15.492016214012647
What is this she was?	16.481576452126607
Barmaid in Jury’s.	5.176684724664358
Or the Moira, was it?	8.884232623307447
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	20.381142808816488
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	5.567714137241194
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	13.601986089343809
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	8.423070224856584
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: —The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue.	17.20414264157209
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	19.826960811932665
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes.	13.088852956704633
He caressed his beard, adding: —Well, nearly all of us.	7.447872608363286
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.	16.644789244777474
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	16.380481990804757
—About the boatman?	15.331125603964113
Mr Power asked.	6.642329128150424
Isn’t it awfully good?	7.817631027741135
—What is that?	9.562956895716088
I didn’t hear it.	5.311782655932715
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both.....	13.898679009544944
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	3.5516425935969638
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	14.301633599975304
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	6.332242459653635
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	12.529054086255632
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	7.542537227943652
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	17.254432869861642
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	19.39911789668545
Is he dead?	17.250245446836605
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	9.273869893919226
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	17.041344713017654
Half the town was there.	10.350859524394833
But the funny part is.....	4.777478938313649
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life.	14.17366938529783
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.	7.90981470319096
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	24.11082975125138
Like a hero.	26.31056454048006
—Isn’t it awfully good?	6.3766602931465375
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	14.246913416933495
—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.	48.82574351830242
Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	16.65714950077506
Nelson’s pillar.	15.6120492026812
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	7.652953748054835
Mr Dedalus sighed.	28.707870938960482
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.	15.797903568060672
Many a good one he told himself.	12.192922951597458
—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers.	14.383361854697212
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.	14.90470561973372
He’s gone from us.	13.078884441722279
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	37.3729596502438
He went very suddenly.	12.597218487300793
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	2.606963729247433
He tapped his chest sadly.	13.027994730610777
Blazing face: redhot.	12.948480417700898
Too much John Barleycorn.	14.752059185197528
Cure for a red nose.	15.42912696179014
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	17.27455174593602
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	6.048059999208439
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	13.690939650779217
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	9.3856252819538
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.	9.361624488302672
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	5.397723108184739
—No suffering, he said.	5.107656368445276
A moment and all is over.	21.477129681165486
Like dying in sleep.	8.430905290128175
No-one spoke.	13.742052298259898
Dead side of the street this.	19.108789169098177
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	8.815401134753328
Why?	12.497976142926124
Some reason.	11.725328032605423
Sun or wind.	7.184257632960914
At night too.	7.716727102876302
Chummies and slaveys.	9.70564496856689
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	16.972519099573326
Foundation stone for Parnell.	8.592917319534681
Breakdown.	32.13581597679176
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	10.395446424422966
A tiny coffin flashed by.	5.734036716863125
In a hurry to bury.	32.27171268456086
A mourning coach.	9.70564496856689
Unmarried.	32.13581597679176
Black for the married.	20.45425622032805
Piebald for bachelors.	14.786396833216765
Dun for a nun.	39.89966068110615
—Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	3.3841729238840395
A child.	18.356479682413188
A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was.	10.12788753588536
Dwarf’s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	12.431833630801439
Burial friendly society pays.	7.622878559556313
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	11.904749800728494
Our.	25.50621404370786
Little.	32.13581597679176
Beggar.	32.13581597679176
Baby.	32.13581597679176
Meant nothing.	7.942397141020434
Mistake of nature.	7.309301069542232
If it’s healthy it’s from the mother.	25.998076144939724
If not from the man.	18.494016559273526
Better luck next time.	4.030509328174743
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	49.68758694102618
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	8.235939396772078
Rattle his bones.	5.949493396039027
Over the stones.	8.366212543914148
Only a pauper.	14.734401266318299
Nobody owns.	12.212364007875731
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	5.318042235915054
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	18.58311197267124
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	8.432090391153505
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	23.879653664953278
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	9.854767787487551
We must take a charitable view of it.	8.965552674196875
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	49.99950656199927
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	8.936246477568549
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	22.94995738440007
Martin Cunningham’s large eyes.	12.39538588464682
Looking away now.	5.874867589679902
Sympathetic human man he is.	4.771413159956671
Intelligent.	32.13581597679176
Like Shakespeare’s face.	6.235783862771728
Always a good word to say.	10.051712708999647
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	19.218644422919123
Refuse christian burial.	11.148858409578036
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	14.785393050699392
As if it wasn’t broken already.	17.025986070598304
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	8.181554481393132
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	15.629980615204811
He looked at me.	7.02794993601759
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	23.496182553724942
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	11.510733426878653
Leading him the life of the damned.	27.090830289442582
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	18.73849376817234
Monday morning.	10.45169215061762
Start afresh.	16.58211792698403
Shoulder to the wheel.	20.4361593810956
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	8.466543899444877
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.	14.987978462253077
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	9.614633890483795
He looked away from me.	12.554997745049901
Rattle his bones.	5.949493396039027
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	6.331990570299806
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	10.846374483135671
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	18.64101210114112
The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	16.66555059525818
Boots giving evidence.	9.70564496856689
Thought he was asleep first.	14.49641897112916
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face.	4.765626079409754
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	7.612307104180939
Verdict: overdose.	11.148858409578036
Death by misadventure.	9.70564496856689
The letter.	13.626029315150411
For my son Leopold.	15.972653812920843
No more pain.	15.392472668320469
Wake no more.	6.764405625241137
Nobody owns.	12.212364007875731
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	5.256485938561819
Over the stones.	8.366212543914148
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	7.69079824522402
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	9.800515065336919
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	6.985230020850028
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	11.395543845016007
The Gordon Bennett.	9.419633402740672
—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said.	44.70607614580782
That will be worth seeing, faith.	8.978158875433671
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	16.41405220000517
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	7.082569710069092
Kay ee double ell wy.	7.446912392688163
Dead March from _Saul._ He’s as bad as old Antonio.	10.05290383864518
He left me on my ownio.	14.947482205764723
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	15.80066306004753
Eccles street.	5.886902607692636
My house down there.	4.569251470590375
Big place.	7.6565712655234135
Ward for incurables there.	4.113484171719205
Very encouraging.	16.58211792698403
Deadhouse handy underneath.	11.148858409578036
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	11.155129819760068
They look terrible the women.	7.2088237413279
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	15.358579316004308
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	22.611238660403885
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	11.024102167978953
He’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me.	10.262694181192204
From one extreme to the other.	9.060270167376988
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	10.200071770029686
—What’s wrong now?	12.659379069054786
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	5.55857363041126
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	6.474970277201035
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.	3.2405526326580145
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	11.672217302207518
Tomorrow is killing day.	4.708763917884671
Springers.	32.13581597679176
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	5.962186178309365
For Liverpool probably.	6.576650952291391
Roastbeef for old England.	12.765970384946032
They buy up all the juicy ones.	12.475188808314813
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	11.924886924311627
Comes to a big thing in a year.	44.05475894808224
Dead meat trade.	8.080465848484218
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	12.21921343774756
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	8.699575604590565
The carriage moved on through the drove.	15.07673497166013
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	11.284572329753258
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	17.885996252217335
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	5.112401307017068
Quite right.	6.760847130337436
They ought to.	8.874988829723751
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	12.721462011284833
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all.	11.186103784030593
Don’t you see what I mean?	14.18671949352702
—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	52.457207716793896
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	11.56787964293341
—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	10.428741208038712
—Why?	13.619971502880057
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	26.184582946692746
Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	9.64907377806561
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.	11.953384335840585
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	17.69919280076728
Terrible! —First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	35.89342584553623
Gordon Bennett cup.	12.09278042839508
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	9.987065655756325
Bom! Upset.	11.148858409578036
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	10.738405817032323
Burst open.	8.425917152462297
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	11.305938720853902
Red face: grey now.	5.224964579019928
Mouth fallen open.	6.486525774962426
Asking what’s up now.	10.670916304269578
Quite right to close it.	12.842322895576832
Looks horrid open.	6.486525774962426
Then the insides decompose quickly.	10.882310100492612
Much better to close up all the orifices.	17.545422101529805
Yes, also.	44.30779749480505
With wax.	12.599684944605478
The sphincter loose.	8.949652011548354
Seal up all.	10.364746367671284
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	11.479912129264065
Dunphy’s corner.	12.045057207306549
A pause by the wayside.	19.26818878846717
Tiptop position for a pub.	14.262442415920802
Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	21.75465092693509
Pass round the consolation.	19.272500373276166
Elixir of life.	4.845299384305662
But suppose now it did happen.	12.000440646425314
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	10.32876711824721
He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose.	19.632188873440906
Depends on where.	11.869655286702958
The circulation stops.	9.70564496856689
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	14.195345968865958
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	20.352717202825954
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	4.8437533362795735
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	12.377705757684277
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	13.161770192045891
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	12.967903412191951
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	10.483866422795291
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	13.826972893412272
Aboard of the _Bugabu._ Their eyes watched him.	13.513961462013379
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	7.104526894260767
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	18.107628846758246
Or cycle down.	5.507247780205937
Hire some old crock, safety.	8.838374690091515
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady’s.	11.336051203174122
Developing waterways.	16.58211792698403
James M’Cann’s hobby to row me o’er the ferry.	12.208478015057143
Cheaper transit.	16.58211792698403
Houseboats.	32.13581597679176
Also hearses.	13.943843522115227
To heaven by water.	8.123115409930127
Perhaps I will without writing.	14.471942992647879
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	10.537362502190499
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	4.236660724043079
With turf from the midland bogs.	14.925910755334781
Salute.	32.13581597679176
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	9.419691928475043
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	5.544637701556884
Near it now.	4.401792574425153
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	10.262001054860491
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	29.178028395497535
—How is that?	7.7765428773933465
Left him weeping, I suppose?	9.310272704206852
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	31.236494941077595
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	6.143115518284324
Last lap.	16.688409521161915
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	8.665330132049261
In white silence: appealing.	8.643554063265618
The best obtainable.	19.16681357793786
Thos.	32.13581597679176
H.	11.300041881167411
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	6.14633179370776
Passed.	32.13581597679176
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	12.350582557210295
After life’s journey.	24.50259634032565
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	8.055666397100056
Mr Power pointed.	29.308973416739725
—That is where Childs was murdered, he said.	5.663327757139637
The last house.	10.031556282850808
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	40.41578298395164
A gruesome case.	7.184257632960914
Seymour Bushe got him off.	17.165578108355533
Murdered his brother.	12.92010796419937
Or so they said.	6.024877039644362
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	7.384871753050475
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	6.643647173067645
That’s the maxim of the law.	19.64771212516658
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	9.277260621192772
They looked.	14.509599876829208
Murderer’s ground.	16.425243310230034
It passed darkly.	14.786396833216765
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	4.505244291492234
Whole place gone to hell.	14.130421978820772
Wrongfully condemned.	12.599684944605478
Murder.	32.13581597679176
The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.	35.26690976532135
They love reading about it.	3.6718525224226575
Man’s head found in a garden.	19.147064182060998
Her clothing consisted of.	6.517995893201855
How she met her death.	10.708788523751656
Recent outrage.	16.58211792698403
The weapon used.	11.148858409578036
Murderer is still at large.	16.65386389110699
Clues.	32.13581597679176
A shoelace.	16.58211792698403
The body to be exhumed.	32.2006196976995
Murder will out.	4.868131376775024
Cramped in this carriage.	16.433515224543243
She mightn’t like me to come that way without letting her know.	14.994176937796327
Must be careful about women.	16.023538309784687
Catch them once with their pants down.	8.375342398003513
Never forgive you after.	10.50440553354314
Fifteen.	22.281730317965827
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	5.226774384508351
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	5.861274592830989
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	6.2154739356861874
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	9.772377199423936
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	16.51672878050025
He stepped out.	7.197966929280573
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	50.13039005755445
Change that soap now.	5.01684175790275
Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	8.635422670549247
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	15.663720029255337
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	6.8866773174831355
It’s all the same.	15.848652079253371
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	6.704281894143289
Pomp of death.	6.675390997486872
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	5.651759380209355
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	8.8082798166919
Dogbiscuits.	32.13581597679176
Mourners coming out.	6.595500872580404
He followed his companions.	16.784962469929734
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	10.41098957646513
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	19.55846034535248
He handed one to the boy.	13.591424587685747
Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?	18.094746500807766
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	6.87316829993207
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	7.4631000731294685
Coffin now.	5.230698116280242
Got here before us, dead as he is.	11.956885606700242
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	16.29188997838735
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	10.266636323004285
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	20.19255071359346
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	5.962286295860347
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	24.441380084374874
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	12.015767690015716
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	13.222759880432433
Thousands every hour.	8.949652011548354
Too many in the world.	9.688024101501652
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	12.2333262743863
Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	23.680576518395767
Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.	11.835444261791293
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	12.419409525944179
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	9.796573418993317
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	22.869567434698332
Who is that beside them?	17.783618557670156
Ah, the brother-in-law.	11.362504222183743
All walked after.	6.254259529238603
Martin Cunningham whispered: —I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	11.262663989568996
Mr Power whispered.	12.491252393081382
How so?	7.261515084584481
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	12.247765323290977
Had the Queen’s hotel in Ennis.	16.123521893833253
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	13.190469691549902
Anniversary.	32.13581597679176
—O God! Mr Power whispered.	20.407288506604853
First I heard of it.	10.804828669834398
Poisoned himself?	11.089130599646293
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum.	19.316034594252265
—Was he insured?	17.450123181298856
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	21.680934739443007
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	13.774767185464317
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	9.656580533616014
—How many children did he leave?	19.77102689891041
—Five.	16.58211792698403
Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.	22.877555806182617
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	10.478408096002186
Five young children.	8.080465848484218
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	29.247939736015002
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	14.561710467571446
Has the laugh at him now.	11.672820597182547
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	21.9560550184856
She had outlived him.	7.045554944526959
Lost her husband.	17.250245446836605
More dead for her than for me.	9.247471687107929
One must outlive the other.	7.587500293411725
Wise men say.	5.304856355629197
There are more women than men in the world.	6.781533433485674
Condole with her.	7.8245485720491015
Your terrible loss.	8.949652011548354
I hope you’ll soon follow him.	8.168309082848705
For Hindu widows only.	6.5432824295768865
She would marry another.	11.79493128520976
Him?	25.50621404370786
No. Yet who knows after.	15.220978942477249
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	20.367111728280115
Drawn on a guncarriage.	23.15415957719411
Victoria and Albert.	11.148858409578036
Frogmore memorial mourning.	7.791124599957709
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	29.44164839336798
Vain in her heart of hearts.	18.245107948222472
All for a shadow.	23.194776627886263
Consort not even a king.	14.939232702981094
Her son was the substance.	25.22872662725736
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	19.2946680684229
It never comes.	11.032610433977897
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	25.683710258393077
—How are you, Simon?	29.942758580496115
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	12.264514634359973
Haven’t seen you for a month of Sundays.	24.526312269469205
—Never better.	9.113466756756022
How are all in Cork’s own town?	23.266004033819723
—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	8.423581284235626
Same old six and eightpence.	16.79917422633974
—And how is Dick, the solid man?	23.776418887453616
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	7.512201095759401
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	14.3710481364156
Dick Tivy bald?	11.148858409578036
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	10.930484140198994
A few bob a skull.	9.014299109457026
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	7.520584931083602
Is that the eldest boy in front?	40.0414633523311
—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother.	16.692702615925317
John Henry Menton is behind.	7.93558974247591
He put down his name for a quid.	39.947895880435944
—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	39.752053237080325
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	9.837135940159614
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	21.991199426688503
—How did he lose it?	17.994787128758915
Ned Lambert asked.	6.973779479054919
Liquor, what?	7.277966954207259
—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	48.203756630300795
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	24.7887637936353
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	18.526679434404677
Both unconscious.	13.943843522115227
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	11.031253998658732
All he might have done.	16.863687054878447
I owe three shillings to O’Grady.	19.659522166590516
Would he understand?	12.872306092276881
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel.	17.27789004370941
Which end is his head?	21.460887099020365
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	23.88151646897723
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	9.023114230578036
Always in front of us.	9.060263187360558
Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel.	14.083257977996029
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	11.749712715539223
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	8.764585692596743
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.	10.007673280975322
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	14.88904935602664
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly.	15.313880929894689
Who’ll read the book?	33.68233749978552
I, said the rook.	31.487583474062607
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	27.160976405930064
I knew his name was like a coffin.	21.612389434573153
_Dominenamine._ Bully about the muzzle he looks.	12.494284429804933
Bosses the show.	6.4345972758613375
Muscular christian.	16.58211792698403
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	8.331296182346096
Thou art Peter.	14.734401266318299
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	14.952616335004766
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	19.737341678215117
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	9.873367461884873
Hhhn: burst sideways.	7.124763581548046
_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._ Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	7.81839801539644
Requiem mass.	11.089130599646298
Crape weepers.	16.58211792698403
Blackedged notepaper.	16.58211792698403
Your name on the altarlist.	30.374174614250677
Chilly place this.	6.486525774962426
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	27.13254977729318
Eyes of a toad too.	10.339205757032468
What swells him up that way?	13.602342912782763
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	7.108476678798343
Air of the place maybe.	28.846839900721175
Looks full up of bad gas.	11.188463824301515
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	14.186544409647103
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	15.972251052739136
Who was telling me?	6.663853890911756
Mervyn Browne.	16.58211792698403
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	12.76739313904979
Out it rushes: blue.	6.053836374621549
One whiff of that and you’re a goner.	15.154920165915929
My kneecap is hurting me.	3.4719550638859062
Ow. That’s better.	17.071421901122807
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	20.983853661057438
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	18.14026277132683
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	15.664741401565783
As you were before you rested.	20.70450453733763
It’s all written down: he has to do it.	12.238875241412057
_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._ The server piped the answers in the treble.	10.364224230082268
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	14.132756054598135
Up to fifteen or so.	12.593403768132497
After that, of course ...	8.094321652385174
Holy water that was, I expect.	16.383670752309218
Shaking sleep out of it.	4.585328916152403
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	11.488643395687252
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over.	15.069032383243092
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	22.543265191850946
On Dignam now.	4.429616469187592
_—In paradisum._ Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise.	18.941589426183683
Says that over everybody.	7.622878559556313
Tiresome kind of a job.	17.622683140600582
But he has to say something.	32.26782959596036
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	21.577760046733133
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	21.331326848183032
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law.	11.918988804971896
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	14.40322066243603
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket.	8.576640258556191
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	18.640444654975436
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	9.039913220940354
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	5.59876783362569
Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.	15.814634865350284
—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	55.65734751224438
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	22.165465168361642
—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’.	19.483533092842837
But his heart is buried in Rome.	14.806358835734887
How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon! —Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said.	21.960360645697858
I’ll soon be stretched beside her.	9.499582448053319
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	8.701344767030145
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	17.685867019802185
Mr Power took his arm.	20.54618757567353
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.	14.974939637495314
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	72.60803861702313
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	25.87427652990289
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	9.155048550763128
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	12.471785353842431
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	10.820642993122057
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	12.76504794637988
I suppose we can do so too.	17.99289155117531
We are the last.	17.63420523885456
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	8.88436193162311
They covered their heads.	8.099170129819411
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?	13.269898999113998
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	16.393027587942676
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	17.729020633135004
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	18.401354546352948
Mason, I think: not sure.	12.515025588349129
Beside him again.	5.825293501143994
We are the last.	17.63420523885456
Hope he’ll say something else.	11.361659008632115
Mr Kernan added: —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	8.925462872715075
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	22.672341148163955
The language of course was another thing.	19.466651248386437
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: —_I am the resurrection and the life_.	18.827023614952502
—It does, Mr Bloom said.	8.430096995319222
No touching that.	4.346761424078208
Seat of the affections.	32.586630699868415
Broken heart.	7.942397141020434
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	6.944874248303066
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	11.092440113630305
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	7.022136700210678
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	4.417637515444742
The resurrection and the life.	17.2829582964391
Once you are dead you are dead.	10.107599337008901
That last day idea.	10.840742877785722
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	14.222268559138755
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	13.207349499582559
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	13.245614329831247
Find damn all of himself that morning.	11.178013919640128
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	11.94781190099845
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	8.55639188197318
Troy measure.	16.58211792698403
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	9.758828206348792
—Everything went off A1, he said.	3.4596265101027557
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	19.233595514765494
Policeman’s shoulders.	13.916923428092344
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	7.48072345639922
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	11.397071816577027
Corny Kelleher said.	4.437192697424715
Mr Kernan assured him.	7.251209649859214
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	25.21713337168849
John Henry Menton asked.	7.6519723486071545
I know his face.	8.559258881627553
Ned Lambert glanced back.	12.686976351822723
—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	29.468855850060773
She’s his wife.	23.74139505228295
—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	11.752976147390411
I haven’t seen her for some time.	8.904121535641687
She was a finelooking woman.	14.065304108558864
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.	11.012525800910455
And a good armful she was.	15.977093701156676
He looked behind through the others.	19.577524343007088
—What is he?	11.57213237888469
What does he do?	14.199980831825183
Wasn’t he in the stationery line?	21.283237137423914
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	22.617093202250278
Ned Lambert smiled.	20.440776790769398
—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s.	10.623038158820192
A traveller for blottingpaper.	9.645223575437983
—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	16.59893454941244
—Has still, Ned Lambert said.	4.499441123408541
He does some canvassing for ads.	9.243486328109535
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.	10.313310459840022
The barrow turned into a side lane.	15.43347381146965
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	12.430538377711324
The gravediggers touched their caps.	13.696171993062013
—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	9.11877750805898
He never forgets a friend.	10.019704442041462
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence.	12.829084349489502
Mr Dedalus said: —I am come to pay you another visit.	22.930293350916727
—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	16.236947199570917
I don’t want your custom at all.	6.593422784912635
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	12.837790268157534
—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	30.510790561851657
—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	8.460724307512764
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	4.635922348830029
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	14.818657611201782
—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	18.473740467270893
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	16.0661531117462
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough.	13.750496692636203
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	21.3782239123454
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	10.65475967380398
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	22.16961161875083
He resumed: —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	11.353659098306581
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	11.170463399027705
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	12.039334533946498
—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	18.04011651263181
—I know, Hynes said.	7.265351311442401
I know that.	11.797357496708818
—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	5.97382731962384
It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	7.848652825175971
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.	22.728708547159076
All want to be on good terms with him.	8.69832915357824
Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.	11.745740531338186
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	10.510746942815556
No passout checks.	11.148858409578036
_Habeas corpus_.	16.58211792698403
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	19.42258614290651
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha?	12.673169321501527
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office.	13.135203415751894
Be the better of a shave.	29.451995246990915
Grey sprouting beard.	8.4492546945381
That’s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	16.806399401188198
And temper getting cross.	6.347442741854127
Silver threads among the grey.	17.527726030081816
Fancy being his wife.	10.323964879916478
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	9.778316097683682
Come out and live in the graveyard.	58.23154396010213
Dangle that before her.	8.018484272354899
It might thrill her first.	4.391284923206835
Courting death.	7.6565712655234135
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	10.769118783140598
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	11.879679162420171
Will o’ the wisp.	21.46814882168916
Gas of graves.	7.598925624375338
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	11.555363421510927
Women especially are so touchy.	10.42980595095267
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	15.216806012688245
Have you ever seen a ghost?	30.76246616489717
Well, I have.	16.602459526004594
It was a pitchdark night.	12.859488276701747
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	10.172814941493604
Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	8.629622179459352
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	10.82639741088797
Learn anything if taken young.	6.43831554485576
You might pick up a young widow here.	11.161105470397729
Men like that.	5.720506772135133
Romeo.	32.13581597679176
Spice of pleasure.	8.807084138068873
In the midst of death we are in life.	13.906178904028039
Both ends meet.	7.598925624375338
Tantalising for the poor dead.	23.950720327194873
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	17.764720240911394
Gnawing their vitals.	11.148858409578036
Desire to grig people.	5.829401928940252
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	15.798520056139724
Eight children he has anyway.	16.550834817936114
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	13.129458162674567
Holy fields.	13.943843522115227
More room if they buried them standing.	8.048987883469286
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t.	5.041449508909868
Standing?	32.13581597679176
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	16.40457999795899
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells.	10.118056721364814
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	7.838863391459187
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	7.255653542160594
Well, so it is.	11.012239150014187
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	17.086229724688668
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	4.166098603482747
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	4.214993699832323
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	10.775827472283572
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	5.60506109477007
Every man his price.	8.031415415994449
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	4.290698592734785
A bargain.	13.943843522115227
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	5.143251697027211
With thanks.	9.573690248878348
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	8.494865855728818
Charnelhouses.	32.13581597679176
Dreadful.	32.13581597679176
Turning green and pink decomposing.	10.42980595095267
Rot quick in damp earth.	5.8853470296891075
The lean old ones tougher.	10.102177045409267
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	17.77607577938597
Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them.	11.395353261936899
Then dried up.	4.6181456885980205
Deathmoths.	32.13581597679176
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	14.011713617920417
Changing about.	7.942397141020434
Live for ever practically.	14.305912271361507
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	10.95023787552351
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	14.15020225081586
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	9.356815029963508
Your head it simply swurls.	6.194709281870844
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	8.665330132049261
He looks cheerful enough over it.	4.337203632757775
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	14.365394158706602
Wonder how he looks at life.	14.07395118314626
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	7.193443123614439
The one about the bulletin.	15.922265172718266
Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning.	11.73924888038155
11 p.m. (closing time).	6.411713360303541
Not arrived yet.	6.674853365842211
Peter.	25.50621404370786
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in fashion.	14.601654351404134
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	6.634537092312915
Keep out the damp.	17.014376816630914
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	8.012467949355408
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	14.786396833216765
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	11.607698554458858
Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least.	27.84732674393576
_De mortuis nil nisi prius_.	7.082569710069092
Go out of mourning first.	17.156901066099504
Hard to imagine his funeral.	11.047986317930198
Seems a sort of a joke.	18.781343569900677
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	10.754389719519937
New lease of life.	3.9112058547395434
—How many have you for tomorrow?	26.9850262861954
the caretaker asked.	7.679586267764609
—Two, Corny Kelleher said.	4.97753657132308
Half ten and eleven.	8.69934914900054
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	14.928300235464992
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	10.187984638383904
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	15.987487301644313
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	6.688800542267971
Burying him.	4.4205234812194965
We come to bury Cæsar.	21.678650728056947
His ides of March or June.	7.3326503106833325
He doesn’t know who is here nor care.	9.927231637465301
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	20.745202891078982
Now who is he I’d like to know?	11.705011394105803
Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is.	8.312749446315655
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	8.78986518547937
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	10.306467106185035
Yes, he could.	41.719894169040344
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	14.940295244661739
We all do.	9.628445200946146
No, ants too.	10.241733809768919
First thing strikes anybody.	8.55639188197318
Bury the dead.	6.382719485288346
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	6.7583538578282525
Well then Friday buried him.	4.156207066836688
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	7.248407474801294
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	18.44579251792404
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	16.85042131333519
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	14.118577089065681
All gnawed through.	8.080465848484218
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	8.710953553434297
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.	16.709089415816813
Lay me in my native earth.	10.04085596111847
Bit of clay from the holy land.	22.03237529885996
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	14.3015780079671
I see what it means.	20.09203957880536
I see.	8.216557747377024
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	10.87290808133882
The Irishman’s house is his coffin.	11.060663049438206
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	7.607429543394193
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	20.60432610575973
Twelve.	32.13581597679176
I’m thirteen.	20.056693773545952
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	16.17006879020744
Death’s number.	30.411811864632135
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	18.597216353542045
He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear.	29.25086330003336
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	8.634849971673468
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	15.887482074336054
Tinge of purple.	12.872306092276881
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	14.974677799050657
Dressy fellow he was once.	17.697671261334545
Used to change three suits in the day.	10.15708576318325
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	12.120541529376029
Hello.	16.067907988395877
It’s dyed.	33.679588401656495
His wife I forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	9.637278387390703
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	16.569123012309337
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	37.064842433816445
Twenty.	32.13581597679176
Pause.	25.50621404370786
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	9.507406510200873
Far away a donkey brayed.	17.193973926318844
Rain.	25.50621404370786
No such ass.	9.70564496856689
Never see a dead one, they say.	16.340386853296344
Shame of death.	6.675390997486872
They hide.	16.58211792698403
Also poor papa went away.	7.378709510549182
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	12.092746873999198
Whisper.	20.244295502353957
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	13.580742770135563
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	16.55478544910564
Wellcut frockcoat.	13.943843522115227
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	14.230250699973677
Well, it is a long rest.	21.901510141638315
Feel no more.	6.764405625241137
It’s the moment you feel.	18.6465309232622
Can’t believe it at first.	17.702448093672924
Mistake must be: someone else.	8.635171091584443
Try the house opposite.	13.768777833538849
Wait, I wanted to.	15.276062983037662
I haven’t yet.	12.202359682388598
Then darkened deathchamber.	11.148858409578036
Light they want.	15.392472668320469
Whispering around you.	4.323639040703681
Would you like to see a priest?	26.340365742401797
Then rambling and wandering.	8.55639188197318
Delirium all you hid all your life.	7.538152238863543
The death struggle.	9.70564496856689
Press his lower eyelid.	9.014958998660607
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	17.039479339994102
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed.	16.36294324261067
Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman.	16.03191696897773
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	17.773726076593572
Last act of _Lucia.	16.097424622153333
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	7.082569710069092
Bam! He expires.	19.27532314904753
Gone at last.	13.811990564275721
Don’t forget to pray for him.	10.733361463884698
Remember him in your prayers.	26.20168586678609
Even Parnell.	11.725328032605423
Ivy day dying out.	4.289439783344825
Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.	17.76156882021722
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	11.231537659638848
Hoping you’re well and not in hell.	13.752045992587528
Nice change of air.	11.209739768375742
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	32.058235074394574
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	25.947298459339365
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	16.694222313044172
Someone walking over it.	3.031694010274119
Callboy’s warning.	35.429549483034535
Near you.	5.074739884440316
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	14.096758855711702
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	31.683547167497803
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	13.391674981065645
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	11.73326394398295
And if he was alive all the time?	20.445401787139723
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	16.542321477014763
Of course he is dead.	19.108464558441426
Monday he died.	14.841306764859908
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	15.05804461109737
Flag of distress.	11.148858409578036
Three days.	13.761408416393792
Rather long to keep them in summer.	11.764354602384635
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.	17.726713610320335
The clay fell softer.	8.55639188197318
Begin to be forgotten.	28.0635662305041
Out of sight, out of mind.	20.84828630471691
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	11.221651126864009
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	8.688873026160636
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	15.341062117725443
Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.	20.376333387201566
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	13.462152773928967
Ah, the names.	44.99239229088018
But he knows them all.	11.93736232511229
No: coming to me.	9.566225025965101
What is your christian name?	14.08109327014965
I’m not sure.	10.968354415314801
—L, Mr Bloom said.	3.0483563317505333
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too.	11.479884997362594
He asked me to.	7.339246423592978
—Charley, Hynes said writing.	9.170576250187205
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	24.19873099072344
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	23.620885890857128
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	8.38613991257032
Find out what they imagine they know.	10.304248985332013
He died of a Tuesday.	38.29321152317961
Got the run.	25.330981153319993
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	26.17014053331742
Charley, you’re my darling.	10.583477281645283
That was why he asked me to.	16.884217713081817
O well, does no harm.	13.773876422593466
I saw to that, M’Coy.	12.648501335169607
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	9.437118055559068
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	5.327284196067573
He looked around.	20.63184531471049
—Macintosh.	16.58211792698403
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	7.960811846809204
Where is he now?	10.02825683452318
—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	9.890120951469372
I don’t know who he is.	5.455004790187569
Is that his name?	25.199204478442727
He moved away, looking about him.	15.252652370900094
—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	11.491704772361855
I say, Hynes! Didn’t hear.	10.98172362337383
Where has he disappeared to?	7.0297413475556425
Not a sign.	20.168384724071032
Well of all the.	14.006328318903583
Kay ee double ell.	9.072081681998874
Become invisible.	12.599684944605478
Good Lord, what became of him?	19.135031184709113
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	9.278722461800808
—O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	21.779323415449653
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	20.07738770374896
It rose.	8.909322665144582
Nearly over.	7.145629591813955
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	9.589796858472853
All uncovered again for a few instants.	15.280924774103095
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump.	10.226297744301506
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	14.019777032858302
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	13.134185862379224
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	9.65763421728493
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	11.94507295234929
His navelcord.	16.58211792698403
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	10.206021671042455
Thanks in silence.	7.064331359377021
Sorry, sir: trouble.	18.01458231775655
Headshake.	32.13581597679176
I know that.	11.797357496708818
For yourselves just.	8.949652011548354
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	11.63297802374189
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said.	15.193587447424676
We have time.	10.780733561569525
—Let us, Mr Power said.	7.2026976442577295
They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts.	13.14766884943888
With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke: —Some say he is not in that grave at all.	15.480758809709846
That the coffin was filled with stones.	13.389308766269052
That one day he will come again.	14.799886910729711
Hynes shook his head.	4.344850096969795
—Parnell will never come again, he said.	7.527381792259453
He’s there, all that was mortal of him.	17.889382094529825
Peace to his ashes.	17.37803046974794
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands.	7.552857937368149
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	11.779739746847733
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	18.75279311135309
Does anybody really?	8.949652011548354
Plant him and have done with him.	10.140910464720102
Like down a coalshoot.	14.639199423003143
All souls’ day.	4.708763917884671
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave.	15.729029722618588
Ten shillings for the gardener.	29.772787155494434
He keeps it free of weeds.	8.728704322625479
Old man himself.	5.44464915617882
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	11.232902164052899
Near death’s door.	13.877938149374529
Who passed away.	5.4148951931014295
Who departed this life.	6.334048684466778
As if they did it of their own accord.	30.98041310576125
Got the shove, all of them.	7.048692428504562
Who kicked the bucket.	5.4137904912465835
More interesting if they told you what they were.	31.414963967506832
So and So, wheelwright.	12.492688860175997
I travelled for cork lino.	9.54325740212424
I paid five shillings in the pound.	20.483300920055477
Or a woman’s with her saucepan.	30.278414046916495
I cooked good Irish stew.	7.406703061026736
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	11.837478124337563
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	6.001831762531222
Old Dr Murren’s.	6.832040081465329
The great physician called him home.	8.858565384787024
Well it’s God’s acre for them.	13.837607540314812
Nice country residence.	12.872306092276881
Newly plastered and painted.	8.55639188197318
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	10.042315825124355
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	5.877689251470581
Better value that for the money.	14.513230726224016
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	9.644603644919691
Expresses nothing.	7.942397141020434
Immortelles.	32.13581597679176
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	9.160756260634097
Like stuffed.	16.58211792698403
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	7.093556868745557
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	5.536981024573339
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	5.631926284592315
Dead animal even sadder.	8.55639188197318
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	11.357401861278133
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	6.584984538175201
Heart on his sleeve.	29.421725399406412
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	12.032870448389797
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	9.448748356246103
Seems anything but pleased.	9.61695119128768
Why this infliction?	11.148858409578036
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	15.699337256658092
Apollo that was.	8.357030347423954
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	9.650047056839684
Faithful departed.	16.58211792698403
As you are now so once were we.	12.117421469235104
Besides how could you remember everybody?	19.44681013415001
Eyes, walk, voice.	11.81323678798236
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	54.85841531945896
After dinner on a Sunday.	16.97358897151184
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	4.688824754206254
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	24.916191904070683
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	9.088268192933832
For instance who?	16.243992361953403
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.	9.249802434018793
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	11.739448420936215
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	26.215913355435838
Some animal.	13.943843522115227
There he goes.	12.91024645768462
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	9.702095455186832
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	12.394499709862638
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	5.0724043610329925
Good hidingplace for treasure.	8.55639188197318
Who lives there?	6.674853365842211
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	9.835403582642366
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn’t he?	6.8910337419594185
Making his rounds.	19.61075504569421
Tail gone now.	5.874867589679902
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	16.45201154418699
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	8.519961371662728
Ordinary meat for them.	4.3526937332296125
A corpse is meat gone bad.	5.749415815067158
Well and what’s cheese?	21.689089785533895
Corpse of milk.	12.09278042839508
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	12.406297425475447
Cremation better.	8.732813016406928
Priests dead against it.	3.164323338770281
Devilling for the other firm.	27.37577691331808
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	7.3326503106833325
Time of the plague.	21.580879895045104
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	6.381254743248029
Lethal chamber.	13.943843522115227
Ashes to ashes.	7.554588130286805
Or bury at sea.	7.969583526803988
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	14.12968168634332
Eaten by birds.	8.080465848484218
Earth, fire, water.	10.295556780776668
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	19.12344033221277
See your whole life in a flash.	21.783149408805766
But being brought back to life no.	11.47526451663121
Can’t bury in the air however.	21.702797353514523
Out of a flying machine.	31.337810141466043
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	7.06591784454733
Underground communication.	16.58211792698403
We learned that from them.	8.902451396945894
Wouldn’t be surprised.	18.04648233049656
Regular square feed for them.	3.968181456552202
Flies come before he’s well dead.	11.717381533568062
Got wind of Dignam.	12.761887012709776
They wouldn’t care about the smell of it.	12.237215346978296
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	4.669024001841299
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	7.30960757756089
Back to the world again.	22.4937057630162
Enough of this place.	22.88743683387385
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	11.603290374397945
Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.	12.80678988457068
Poor papa too.	7.212452927051137
The love that kills.	12.116599241714928
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	11.000895093791806
Give you the creeps after a bit.	12.754711105811968
I will appear to you after death.	16.758243311578944
You will see my ghost after death.	7.303927762517464
My ghost will haunt you after death.	4.126211122816197
There is another world after death named hell.	14.118031095694535
I do not like that other world she wrote.	9.840366876876459
Feel live warm beings near you.	3.400187718802787
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	15.8823454337229
They are not going to get me this innings.	15.90255541483504
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	4.50802654074252
Solicitor, I think.	6.7896687153179816
I know his face.	8.559258881627553
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	8.520201562149014
Dignam used to be in his office.	21.943929636991673
Mat Dillon’s long ago.	9.408568100319236
Jolly Mat.	16.58211792698403
Convivial evenings.	16.58211792698403
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	10.776077724252472
Heart of gold really.	14.969777174298942
Yes, Menton.	38.56529407939595
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	7.544741005074173
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	18.89773263218441
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	8.856989741204748
Hate at first sight.	12.628269612391048
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	10.100368638223584
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	7.285563067516942
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	17.45608491365204
Carriage probably.	8.572509804002673
—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	8.19009227022577
They stopped.	9.573690248878348
—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	12.872989398018012
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	12.352247503032135
—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	13.568172772748138
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	10.775684285921526
He clapped the hat on his head again.	7.225319887618734
—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	6.450571158836437
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	13.96709635163582
—Thank you, he said shortly.	11.76140769155407
They walked on towards the gates.	22.906692892877146
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	15.022322771381235
Martin laying down the law.	12.483624289808596
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	9.653885017981285
Oyster eyes.	6.061679814198452
Never mind.	8.291058963492015
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	4.404056392864055
Get the pull over him that way.	6.14730738215638
Thank you.	6.017557420495328
How grand we are this morning! [ 7 ] IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross.	5.3185469104829055
The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company’s timekeeper bawled them off: —Rathgar and Terenure! —Come on, Sandymount Green! Right and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck moved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.	8.532096579851219
—Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	7.630985170388798
Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	10.308116189708532
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	6.9572865453899775
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	9.205417603260457
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s stores.	9.323367206990532
—There it is, Red Murray said.	11.473525956284
Alexander Keyes.	21.828163973441153
—Just cut it out, will you?	14.723113816747917
Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	18.21047643654613
The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again.	8.669782035608316
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.	14.849195906366681
Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	15.77530426477084
Scissors and paste.	9.70564496856689
—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	12.750902847795864
—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	16.65569965748277
—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	15.34091618364678
I’ll rub that in.	15.06775959719317
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered: —Brayden.	8.564630619400752
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.	9.853592319817318
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels.	23.424428481656804
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	10.703035577983009
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	3.8806848678357277
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	17.406928902800672
Welts of flesh behind on him.	4.886305172216848
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	6.884597227772886
—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	15.463653078744935
Red Murray whispered.	14.841306764859908
The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree.	11.225644371505012
Way in.	8.92033010833772
Way out.	5.885791345035451
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	13.480254015363688
Mary, Martha.	22.606296099225155
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	14.621902997972073
—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	4.080759596430884
—Yes, Red Murray agreed.	13.932659465102425
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	12.742222176064585
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	5.7730549696817235
Hand on his heart.	17.25596124400237
In _Martha._ Co-ome thou lost one, Co-ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN —His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	5.775560893712943

A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _—Freeman!_ Mr Bloom said slowly: —Well, he is one of our saviours also.	14.142524509133152
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	10.187011296030612
But will he save the circulation?	16.28544598352315

Thumping.	22.281730317965827
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	7.398308040477831
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti’s reading closet.	10.420884103302775

Working away, tearing away.	7.500022568989877

HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	8.075576823553426

Thump, thump, thump.	10.601794175163626
Now if he got paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they’d clank on and on the same, print it over and over and up and back.	17.007757238652932
Monkeydoodle the whole thing.	12.350176061049098
Want a cool head.	11.40837146430605
—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	9.92767095638867
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	14.379995583919925
Long John is backing him, they say.	9.536101693217729
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	19.841739729724726
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	14.975956807401923
—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	7.07593088445576
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	23.170327938651543
—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	11.345124682497154
—Did you?	11.089670942636046
Hynes asked.	6.175031302735487
—Mm, Mr Bloom said.	3.0483563317505333
Look sharp and you’ll catch him.	5.430442904370262
—Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	5.306442146819204
I’ll tap him too.	11.348951355944005
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.	13.301918745562832
Three bob I lent him in Meagher’s.	10.067910876434446
Three weeks.	12.599684944605478
Third hint.	16.58211792698403
—Excuse me, councillor, he said.	5.369090377545839
This ad, you see.	6.685089488175271
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	5.669346445996103
—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	8.579582368995498
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	3.9806256471753887
—But wait, Mr Bloom said.	6.545994121805597
He wants it changed.	12.584637471242038
He wants two keys at the top.	17.16565111557676
Hell of a racket they make.	18.288727447937365
He doesn’t hear it.	5.237124769275044
Nannan.	32.13581597679176
Iron nerves.	12.599684944605478
Maybe he understands what I.	7.692007826315155
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	14.837390469277448
—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	10.232520015289392
Let him take that in first.	22.153066433892672
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	15.117264773612927
Clank it.	3.7292824769790833
Clank it.	3.7292824769790833
Miles of it unreeled.	29.5372689814675
What becomes of it after?	18.552298321737485
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	8.341288911964169
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	14.861891625469534
HOUSE OF KEY(E)S —Like that, see.	5.215959574617653
Two crossed keys here.	4.267155220594657
A circle.	12.599684944605478
Then here the name.	10.601046642267587
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	10.017088542371027
So on.	5.175583470401267
Better not teach him his own business.	21.739834640435014
—You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants.	18.86066351688386
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	17.753637977840253
You see?	16.875528743607145
Do you think that’s a good idea?	22.613027498285934
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	7.846017934784312
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	26.505960891593748
Innuendo of home rule.	12.204095486154442
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	14.150233578843396
Catches the eye, you see.	10.8597334669969
Can you do that?	20.993203056206088
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him.	8.848808194994184
Better not.	15.434842766472132
—We can do that, the foreman said.	10.40569115119943
Have you the design?	30.614877722103827
—I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	7.76674621816534
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	18.748274241418695
He has a house there too.	13.334157012191893
I’ll just run out and ask him.	11.76469203370461
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	21.829805029181255
You know the usual.	61.45939129449519
Highclass licensed premises.	9.082836641605333
Longfelt want.	11.089130599646298
So on.	5.175583470401267
The foreman thought for an instant.	9.271479200237062
—We can do that, he said.	4.392826115770451
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	12.252928836502647
He began to check it silently.	11.856153873009374
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	13.909975527434343

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	21.612642726691707
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	26.758049570421377
Thank you.	6.017557420495328
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	14.422290969628415

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: —Wait.	6.6549223343656445
Where’s the archbishop’s letter?	28.355328013918715
It’s to be repeated in the _Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?	18.830654136931404
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	17.825306199458613
—Monks, sir?	11.222183406958152
a voice asked from the castingbox.	25.615215120022928
—Ay. Where’s Monks?	35.25381256626762
Time to get out.	12.384848784464431
—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a good place I know.	18.70661956521458
—Monks! —Yes, sir.	6.613601060602401
Three months’ renewal.	9.645223575437983

Old Monks, the dayfather.	37.31850480375404
Queer lot of stuff he must have put through his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches, divorce suits, found drowned.	8.751659547162078
Nearing the end of his tether now.	7.739726969879556

And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.	51.49905326665696
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	15.61812530081658
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	13.492131827824167
Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else.	8.878983497102066
That’s what life is after all.	11.791944051528468
How quickly he does that job.	8.738416607924647
Practice makes perfect.	9.70564496856689
Seems to see with his fingers.	19.91006187517821
Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing.	21.951966493274462
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	18.978259202568818
Better phone him up first.	8.086494225780127
Number?	32.13581597679176

Ah, the soap I put there.	33.781189384318274
Lose it out of that pocket.	11.24141113895659
Putting back his handkerchief he took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.	11.38782725798278
What perfume does your wife use?	7.032932967868121
I could go home still: tram: something I forgot.	11.582294081454743
Just to see: before: dressing.	10.37494549063353
No. Here.	24.22956501158733
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	11.3819302101289
Know who that is.	6.197280138152982
What’s up?	16.228913348355878
Pop in a minute to phone.	16.85781324536776
He entered softly.	10.01942386405799
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA —The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	8.91723454994109
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: —Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	16.755114124674204
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: —_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	10.868827274241562
What about that, Simon?	23.052891062769934
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	32.435390565706975
How’s that for high?	22.99568625661501
—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	32.35758261151405
O boys! O boys! —And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	27.713798154027018
—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	12.132926619704092
I don’t want to hear any more of the stuff.	20.842811059050128
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	11.17654911737561
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does.	19.75344725441817

—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	4.184087178087741
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
_Our lovely land_.	11.148858409578036
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT —Whose land?	6.20962318817785
Mr Bloom said simply.	14.081055388216878
—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	13.537052688291002
With an accent on the whose.	21.19546526666572
—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.	6.059820063143957
—Is it his speech last night?	14.94932013535601
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
Ned Lambert nodded.	21.08078377672747
—But listen to this, he said.	6.604088878875314
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	23.741232039749523
—Excuse me, J.	6.8313055534718625
O’Molloy said, entering.	18.54320780625022
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	12.668266342932483
—I beg yours, he said.	8.948944486074907
—Good day, Jack.	11.930461424721912
—Come in.	7.729905865674497
Come in.	5.958468043103521
—Good day.	11.823213467167257
—How are you, Dedalus?	36.68503120004503
—Well.	34.948329323206586
And yourself?	10.19448965235056
O’Molloy shook his head.	8.662588966000552

That hectic flush spells finis for a man.	5.914629734093496
Touch and go with him.	5.961899205021159
What’s in the wind, I wonder.	19.48605679309434
Money worry.	13.943843522115227
—Is the editor to be seen?	33.011499210428724
O’Molloy asked, looking towards the inner door.	14.653414170977195
—Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	4.694808095215814
To be seen and heard.	22.581554940728445
He’s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	14.765529389237956
O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	21.743241016111607
Practice dwindling.	16.58211792698403
A mighthavebeen.	16.58211792698403
Losing heart.	7.942397141020434
Gambling.	32.13581597679176
Debts of honour.	9.850079940221093
Reaping the whirlwind.	9.70564496856689
Used to get good retainers from D.	8.368350387371217
and T.	7.974602935354842
Fitzgerald.	32.13581597679176
Their wigs to show the grey matter.	10.689141178925714
Brains on their sleeve like the statue in Glasnevin.	12.931785463162859
Believe he does some literary work for the _Express_ with Gabriel Conroy.	14.866419369994444
Wellread fellow.	8.909322665144582
Myles Crawford began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	17.03320645773911
Weathercocks.	32.13581597679176
Wouldn’t know which to believe.	14.660204168389772
One story good till you hear the next.	11.423208374409795
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	18.200874371976017
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	7.451471765851405
—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	12.982398078951892
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks..._ —Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	8.74375539701771
Enough of the inflated windbag! —_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were..._ —Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	19.885438752221752
Blessed and eternal God! Yes?	10.481214468783717
Is he taking anything for it?	16.36268814401635
_—As ’twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio, unmatched, despite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions, for very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious pastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent glow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight..._ HIS NATIVE DORIC —The moon, professor MacHugh said.	7.561414884920476
He forgot Hamlet.	11.148858409578036
_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._ —O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	12.80025123042916
Shite and onions! That’ll do, Ned.	10.50175889153286
Life is too short.	19.66613575990139
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	11.089642686728265
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face.	10.631603011635603
—Doughy Daw! he cried.	5.368185860505962
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	7.035001884231832
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he?	13.762637510552192
Feathered his nest well anyhow.	4.766215968557041
Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor.	17.301995845867854
Hooked that nicely.	8.949652011548354
Entertainments.	32.13581597679176
Open house.	7.0274793145533945
Wetherup always said that.	6.332692275733339
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	27.418879038370523
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: —What is it?	8.899882955243395
—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.	9.882675873376426
—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	11.589996997269122
—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat.	47.42797567494438
I must get a drink after that.	12.468948427807105
—Drink! the editor cried.	4.782683799341021
No drinks served before mass.	5.627791510240851
—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	48.21286023192016
Come on, Ned.	15.915690888854995
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	10.062794193761222
The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.	14.630373599679142
—Will you join us, Myles?	15.41021362416098
Ned Lambert asked.	6.973779479054919
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! —Where was that, Myles?	12.65044765097821
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	26.418707893653405
—In Ohio! the editor shouted.	12.668863124735902
—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	15.608469954316229
Passing out he whispered to J.	6.884275071647244
O’Molloy: —Incipient jigs.	18.929958388913523
Sad case.	9.573690248878348
—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	7.15079843874981
My Ohio! —A perfect cretic! the professor said.	7.517115894387485
Long, short and long.	8.675170876653034
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	12.362678012743666
—Bingbang, bangbang.	8.55639188197318
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	16.78082627770126
—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	9.815428404437956
I just want to phone about an ad.	16.228365646592238
He went in.	12.525110846260953
—What about that leader this evening?	13.260753816781845
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	18.24149759629106
—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	10.307820170035734
Never you fret.	11.148858409578036
Hello, Jack.	14.35837839966574
—Good day, Myles, J.	11.127355613168548
O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	13.474355382689412
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	9.288016964947522
The telephone whirred inside.	8.48197985150906
Yes.	9.732442163148734
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	16.787417785399608
Sceptre with O.	6.3042630705602685
Madden up.	4.826182898933149
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	13.395462906982784
—Hush, Lenehan said.	2.761892664372275
I hear feetstoops.	23.73046605627381
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	16.443765424254913
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	12.232786987436738
—It wasn’t me, sir.	11.988804341336063
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	9.464934096583388
—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	10.761464356387208
There’s a hurricane blowing.	15.431862559081898
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	13.400056684393608
—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	8.377204873135874
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	6.292313609106787
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	9.545729325415335
—Him, sir.	5.613841494037567
—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	17.02616906376573
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	10.358224164230675
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: —Continued on page six, column four.	10.600015533128643
—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	14.005973442488637
Is the boss...?	11.326990327557574
Yes, _Telegraph_...	6.473635439776192
To where?	16.58211792698403
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	3.4961561395247536
Aha! I see...	8.759292345281764
Right.	16.79925355716022
I’ll catch him.	6.730548231004371
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	5.1449109583907635
—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	11.8157744800558
—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	11.950784371276667
Are you hurt?	27.080967686402566
I’m in a hurry.	21.000693584917865
—Knee, Lenehan said.	2.761892664372275
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: —The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	11.756761648942803
—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	3.957157073005634
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	22.808174979008452
O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	12.367388560979451
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	10.718867487828218
EXIT BLOOM —I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes’s.	10.271034396794468
Want to fix it up.	9.827202226711066
They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s.	14.810231719992046
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	15.818100839585803
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	14.658729513758535
—Begone! he said.	3.0617397882484845
The world is before you.	5.940143888126406
—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	12.387529508304437
O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	19.1862459127442
—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	14.799811542070067
Look at the young scamps after him.	10.520171928985386
Where?	14.036610527842967
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	18.227092721745347
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	14.016503814899082
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you’ll kick.	13.930482446775587
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	12.623888013735165
Small nines.	16.58211792698403
Steal upon larks.	11.148858409578036
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	7.076995035379274
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	12.850839348496583
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
Myles Crawford said with a start.	27.22691727528726
Where are the other two gone?	28.073650528974206
—Who?	8.672134463555837
the professor said, turning.	10.040013646178474
They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	12.620565270092447
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	14.110371633948146
Came over last night.	5.187017843341681
—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	6.238411237525394
Where’s my hat?	22.138760025418733
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	12.796811813611395
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	17.502644972184203
—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.	13.359214364240936
—Seems to be, J.	13.93778868266704
O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	12.364351328833285
Who has the most matches?	31.10992089034563
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	11.867725882396392
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	11.0858914443307
O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	9.710502641442295
—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	6.683174093501889
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	15.600370684082563
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’Twas empire charmed thy heart.	5.484439231711302
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	5.030838620854675
—Eh?	10.98663243565522
You bloody old Roman empire?	11.296873571782095
Myles Crawford said.	3.3263589130279745
He took a cigarette from the open case.	11.163210518934173
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: —Silence for my brandnew riddle! —_Imperium romanum_, J.	13.178432104485035
O’Molloy said gently.	10.495137746556615
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	5.504583264405476
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	10.426142844585433
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	12.76448935176376
—That’s it, he said.	9.305546331236224
We are the fat.	17.430483666944543
You and I are the fat in the fire.	25.800727370285227
We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	13.904254841606889
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME —Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	6.272809134042417
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	7.561132447940205
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: —What was their civilisation?	7.183763695232857
Vast, I allow: but vile.	17.727836559355776
Cloacae: sewers.	11.148858409578036
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	13.011752039501857
He gazed about him in his toga and he said: _It is meet to be here.	14.397575263204839
Let us construct a watercloset._ —Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said.	8.380828059691162
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream.	16.92882597497412
—They were nature’s gentlemen, J.	15.417608972948951
O’Molloy murmured.	23.721590993259774
But we have also Roman law.	9.427766850335066
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	8.113873551041905
—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles?	10.20926109669082
O’Molloy asked.	12.4692199305434
It was at the royal university dinner.	31.798334207026315
Everything was going swimmingly ...	4.424648021616854
—First my riddle, Lenehan said.	4.922752848367357
Are you ready?	29.368544992620652
Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from the hallway.	8.776829916034647
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	24.315552516255796
—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.	7.180079657434882
—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously.	8.776124675251985
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	8.38613991257032
—How do you do?	8.420916616175605
Come in.	5.958468043103521
Your governor is just gone.	5.6091446836895
???	19.8459753406449
Lenehan said to all: —Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	20.036973002525542
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	4.7187708815253195
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	13.560074760568028
—Who?	8.672134463555837
the editor asked.	11.537513340047795
Bit torn off.	5.507247780205937
—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	5.307919140184946
—That old pelters, the editor said.	8.341727108255958
Who tore it?	7.195682506160408
Was he short taken?	15.841716313415132
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	4.58160853566977
—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	9.665765853325393
Foot and mouth?	17.094504337465246
Are you turned...?	19.731922990561205
Bullockbefriending bard.	11.725328032605423
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT —Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	6.400530980133813
The letter is not mine.	15.4069817456219
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	6.768434366212275
—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	16.736906180685658
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	5.962186178309365
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face in the Star and Garter.	12.261392280021067
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	6.969852718510398
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	7.689474155087037
—Is he a widower?	25.298221761672522
—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	22.50235517675455
Emperor’s horses.	26.449468592235462
Habsburg.	32.13581597679176
Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	5.643988035579902
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	8.154438451937946
Going to be trouble there one day.	12.863756664793756
Wild geese.	10.595029903244942
O yes, every time.	12.447143324361669
Don’t you forget that! —The moot point is did he forget it, J.	12.56595229727686
Saving princes is a thank you job.	11.746616919439356
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	7.19151686353401
—And if not?	23.293772333634042
he said.	3.724527490343976
—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	14.207009751615592
A Hungarian it was one day...	10.867473943886795
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED —We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	5.509046072091167
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	37.67913747576577
We were never loyal to the successful.	29.503297556882732
We serve them.	4.513077947487733
I teach the blatant Latin language.	7.356113962671098
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	11.252122280456563
Material domination.	16.58211792698403
_Dominus!_ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	28.988114784120125
Lord Jesus?	16.58211792698403
Lord Salisbury?	16.58211792698403
A sofa in a westend club.	19.456650004334566
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	10.227244159283464
—The Greek! he said again.	16.241984038354786
_Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	12.571138743511929
_Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.	25.15338179473663
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	16.497733608301175
_Kyrie eleison!_ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	14.040097896417098
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	14.946064861734628
Yes, yes.	9.428950605685886
They went under.	25.420370515083327
Pyrrhus, misled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece.	8.498180460131037
Loyal to a lost cause.	16.320184916044674
He strode away from them towards the window.	12.1165267908232
—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	10.433793009384525
—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	8.982664214700202
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	28.348404208996413
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen’s ear: LENEHAN’S LIMERICK —_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	7.531553143753715
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	7.119405279704857
I can’t see the Joe Miller.	10.472754401891141
Whose mother is beastly dead.	5.547196611838576
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	11.028443323676804
—That’ll be all right, he said.	6.524357766442923
I’ll read the rest after.	15.907074676908188
That’ll be all right.	5.384188536640565
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	13.203256983511535
—But my riddle! he said.	8.27724228744805
What opera is like a railwayline?	14.184727162197024
—Opera?	16.58211792698403
Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.	10.665009699533663
Lenehan announced gladly: —_The Rose of Castile_.	12.539236881863246
See the wheeze?	26.44067941075762
Rows of cast steel.	9.06432141722416
Gee! He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	11.766457027802366
Mr O’Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	10.053185996238959
—Help! he sighed.	12.232387923396447
I feel a strong weakness.	30.102592818923732
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	14.254000053595448
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.	12.74491315841475
—Paris, past and present, he said.	7.6072102126707986
You look like communards.	15.204735768436997
—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	7.704201700963818
O’Molloy said in quiet mockery.	17.09665837461838
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	7.168299382498412
You look as though you had done the deed.	13.590438534085653
General Bobrikoff.	16.58211792698403
OMNIUM GATHERUM —We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	7.236186041860854
—All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	4.316905187821791
Law, the classics...	7.230261061037072
—The turf, Lenehan put in.	19.80231682777201
—Literature, the press.	17.892326959590672
—If Bloom were here, the professor said.	7.522508909213301
The gentle art of advertisement.	9.515286546905244
—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added.	14.078258508508288
The vocal muse.	8.949652011548354
Dublin’s prime favourite.	23.424428481656804
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	13.786682159267107
—Ahem! he said very softly.	9.406811071011719
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	20.60738865521191
The gate was open.	5.581921561892808
“YOU CAN DO IT!” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.	5.755130634925809
—I want you to write something for me, he said.	13.762998043797973
Something with a bite in it.	7.0075513402855965
You can do it.	7.592123456362141
I see it in your face.	8.799517130935264
_In the lexicon of youth_...	3.013430198397278
See it in your face.	5.156601670850956
See it in your eye.	6.80541363210069
Lazy idle little schemer.	5.8472744879066205
—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective.	6.688408642998439
Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory.	7.345885928077137
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	6.817152850028288
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	15.019059726627564
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.	10.485092416475522
—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	3.9335713052078956
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	19.284105389002136
—He wants you for the pressgang, J.	12.067672765500072
O’Molloy said.	5.627656876585404
THE GREAT GALLAHER —You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	13.545172913981048
We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	13.903979614877265
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	12.826406382522208
That was a pen.	42.89599791354383
You know how he made his mark?	23.268284985467847
I’ll tell you.	4.52872175735615
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	11.822395419267009
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	15.433924483974689
I’ll show you.	6.925787857744149
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	13.028531992738383
Remember that time?	19.16892235710477
Professor MacHugh nodded.	12.808961334324536
—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	8.824185390011763
Where it took place.	8.067278055461115
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	8.704124012073633
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	8.683281194075853
Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car.	4.304603954702636
Whole route, see?	7.126433808040107
—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	3.2048375405562806
Fitzharris.	32.13581597679176
He has that cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	16.50805920496225
Holohan told me.	4.783207357605977
You know Holohan?	24.870879440204675
—Hop and carry one, is it?	6.101835262934715
Myles Crawford said.	3.3263589130279745
—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	20.918708200885046
A night watchman.	11.148858409578036
Stephen turned in surprise.	16.681578471625155
—Gumley?	16.58211792698403
he said.	3.724527490343976
You don’t say so?	11.553546750429664
A friend of my father’s, is it?	12.933286628989762
Let Gumley mind the stones, see they don’t run away.	9.049915584195636
Look at here.	6.8411582062025245
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	12.058640984151955
I’ll tell you.	4.52872175735615
Inspiration of genius.	14.734401266318299
Cabled right away.	5.4148951931014295
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March?	20.16814193879407
Right.	16.79925355716022
Have you got that?	7.443772169003721
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	18.422918354346923
—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say.	9.744977264919422
Have you got that?	7.443772169003721
Right.	16.79925355716022
The telephone whirred.	13.251537962849325
A DISTANT VOICE —I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.	11.602468178434384
—B is parkgate.	8.55639188197318
—T is viceregal lodge.	6.542686432621648
C is where murder took place.	6.399055166010526
K is Knockmaroon gate.	6.050282722232762
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles.	23.973911905759675
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	13.010682482455088
—Hello?	20.711210005987766
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	7.510337741551564
Hello?...	2.3977583239910616
Who’s there?...	7.115471592765471
Yes...	5.025588824630671
Yes...	5.025588824630671
Yes.	9.732442163148734
—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	5.406378214407208
F.A.B.P. Got that?	11.062635383538948
X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	7.160026702601392
The professor came to the inner door.	12.713806297756237
—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	13.210466810786592
—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	22.666633899432636
X is Davy’s publichouse, see?	7.8525047352412845
CLEVER, VERY —Clever, Lenehan said.	2.6068879119174113
Very.	32.13581597679176
—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	20.025585366360488
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	17.713194428807423
—I saw it, the editor said proudly.	41.2776707546359
I was present.	30.025064981043258
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: —Madam, I’m Adam.	20.356113862424888
—History! Myles Crawford cried.	8.481096703446044
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first.	9.524089522081718
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	7.811439055960749
Out of an advertisement.	32.79367227920921
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	6.689568783746611
That gave him the leg up.	8.064308663619151
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._ Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld.	14.2438034060061
That’s press.	26.235135905182453
That’s talent.	35.36512466688197
—Hello?...	3.1620775241148396
Are you there?...	6.601151215113065
Yes, he’s here still.	18.106248913359757
Come across yourself.	6.901633021014249
—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	17.835946106018053
the editor cried.	7.808574906014599
He flung the pages down.	10.99795400338215
—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.	9.473823507470586
—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	4.824521832954021
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	9.322868605641968
—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	11.003023365684703
—O yes, J.	11.887442496909348
O’Molloy said eagerly.	11.346541392660368
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin.	13.925835563191443
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.	7.165730284287844
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! —They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	7.891854424165259
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.	22.80032334700071
Ah, bloody nonsense.	26.43745845364096
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	14.91900348869943
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	5.206925997699409
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	9.709428616405063
How do you know?	22.773021695635236
Why did you write it then?	23.33776799814924
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	6.954940221720194
Is the mouth south someway?	17.1100510858249
Or the south a mouth?	16.489048177311773
Must be some.	25.756215145833092
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	8.645527962338711
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	12.785511967046492

—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	5.623637678331076
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	2.615771504720943
O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	23.180621853567267
—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	14.54434577303204
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	7.090042881997116
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	8.107944149806624
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	14.63111812349757
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	14.280780860592651
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	37.09109475076547
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE —Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	7.441541508175023
Irish volunteers.	16.58211792698403
Established 1763.	7.0274793145533945
Dr Lucas.	16.58211792698403
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	8.668771409952772
Psha! —Well, J.	10.726580599317328
O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.	16.936099302928604
—Bushe?	16.58211792698403
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	12.836536373537529
He has a strain of it in his blood.	27.032393840543172
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	10.548391893533944
—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for ....	15.704828540115786
But no matter.	15.484180133068639
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: —One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	13.882437840357317
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	21.602642913054556
Bushe defended him.	3.871661339954168
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._ By the way how did he find that out?	15.272943237734609
He died in his sleep.	20.65075075256
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	20.16496165269997
—What was that?	10.371744616819749
the professor asked.	7.615876619276244
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM —He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	9.101197837030584
O’Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	14.421328955911674
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	18.11035315726284
—Ha. —A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	21.645969652345578
Silence! Pause.	12.872306092276881
O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	19.58377410835657
False lull.	16.58211792698403
Something quite ordinary.	11.148858409578036
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	9.396970025947777
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	13.59170114522793
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	4.113484171719205
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words: —He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._ His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	10.927002305134613
—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	9.455167262735694
—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	4.721691225980219
—You like it?	20.97623227467241
O’Molloy asked Stephen.	10.067197124774893
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	12.912225275677091
He took a cigarette from the case.	14.119717339594745
O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	11.165412395799166
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: —Muchibus thankibus.	8.073120884023451
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE —Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	7.458559404543426
O’Molloy said to Stephen.	10.444749446169771
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	12.3113112886042
E.	10.582866589593744
the mastermystic?	16.58211792698403
That Blavatsky woman started it.	3.2568755727831085
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	20.640051776186834
A.	9.643960518690632
E.	10.582866589593744
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	10.34035810280077
E.’s leg.	46.29827850268465
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	25.195809946956228
Speaking about me.	7.064581697615853
What did he say?	8.547946231134873
What did he say?	8.547946231134873
What did he say about me?	10.896085609318208
Don’t ask.	14.943253618082478
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	12.362045110416531
Wait a moment.	6.6625473516276505
Let me say one thing.	16.91230750670976
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	11.946957633733382
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	13.537897356037053
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	13.881307929758375
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	21.89682005771198
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	6.261867612735052
O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	16.336433247088493
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock.	23.692291431830586
Go on.	8.232132251817882
Well?	17.685021073205338
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement.	14.056574890624695
It was then a new movement.	27.789746153044394
We were weak, therefore worthless.	11.032716500795994
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	13.540866177752902
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	4.259879087680909
O’Molloy: —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	20.476221372072647
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	17.063601988198783
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	5.777124307164343
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	9.941782223294904
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	7.202491687537935
O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	20.181891331591764
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	7.63883704480051
Still seeking, he said: —When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	8.735282687438755
He raised his head firmly.	18.030907531253433
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	10.325456014214856
He began: _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	9.71005300773358
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._ His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	16.243095792517433
_And let our crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.	4.330667167500065
Look out.	5.885791345035451
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	19.30036640965656
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	14.123942540142052
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me._ FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	10.715817853947515
Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.	22.80003086901755
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	14.017259444339336
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	11.753836205505067
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	6.754227958880461
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity._ Nile.	14.207288850564865
Child, man, effigy.	15.702315260620544
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	7.137145018977675
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	6.481102227333678
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	7.398631385879144
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name._ A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	10.016593654429965
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	12.357087222428682
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw._ He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.	12.822900353649151
OMINOUS—FOR HIM! J.	3.54858631562593
O’Molloy said not without regret: —And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	9.757596887967551
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise, Lenehan added.	4.015579796285277
And with a great future behind him.	13.065353599205968
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	6.222764545652007
—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	16.675518110766834
Gone with the wind.	23.623337646029654
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	11.242437352864435
Miles of ears of porches.	8.665330132049261
The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	16.492399693344375
A people sheltered within his voice.	5.618275218004174
Dead noise.	11.089130599646298
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	14.332476922858994
Love and laud him: me no more.	10.335813594792763
I have money.	17.997203815780978
—Gentlemen, Stephen said.	3.0452396092909093
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	14.018784834555744
—You take my breath away.	13.933307493264566
Mr O’Madden Burke asked.	6.140167175069874
’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	8.659422714498312
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	17.199760282383206
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	25.924026535533386
The contrary no.	6.486525774962426
I declare it carried.	13.042044000554291
To which particular boosing shed...?	6.8429883610472295
My casting vote is: Mooney’s! He led the way, admonishing: —We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	11.390595206682617
Yes, we will not.	28.925329110583238
By no manner of means.	10.181112393342232
Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella: —Lay on, Macduff! —Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	16.072174319020327
Let us go.	14.178444820817186
Where are those blasted keys?	15.513375953917283
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	13.675335716611958
—Foot and mouth.	7.707575572547524
That’ll be all right.	5.384188536640565
That’ll go in.	14.351866534570041
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	14.71813284177817
LET US HOPE J.	4.113484171719205
O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: —I hope you will live to see it published.	23.93034289303882
Myles, one moment.	18.045022903150073
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	11.091309172129368
—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	8.90855741341178
That is fine, isn’t it?	6.4436977748479585
It has the prophetic vision.	18.28585903234099
_Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.	10.577705340133983
Kingdoms of this world.	11.754869946538891
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	8.666167909153916
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: —Racing special! Dublin.	11.728750378515985
I have much, much to learn.	35.23335640595691
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	7.7688644813143535
—I have a vision too, Stephen said.	10.91189657383401
—Yes?	25.13740288548873
Crawford will follow.	11.148858409578036
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: —Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	11.009661556829922
—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.	8.307630131309846
—Where is that?	9.329257870574237
the professor asked.	7.615876619276244
—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	3.5035858202545382
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	5.636211105707435
Against the wall.	10.071070012156087
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	8.061948826630701
Frantic hearts.	12.599684944605478
Akasic records.	23.60097507926347
Quicker, darlint! On now.	4.9640053075664365
Dare it.	4.258023366747632
Let there be life.	5.6595854092343245
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.	12.22647838442622
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	11.218895824297007
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	13.186291303132617
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	15.945970346292288
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	12.644144656185267
—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	3.3350672012601565
LIFE ON THE RAW —They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	5.654867170770659
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	14.205284298919938
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	14.317780140516913
Glory be to God.	6.95716652941755
They had no idea it was that high.	18.03736435594349
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	6.209623188177851
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	9.160814710335739
—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	8.41551410097853
Vestal virgins.	11.089130599646298
I can see them.	12.519919203931353
What’s keeping our friend?	19.940224213530477
He turned.	38.131143338215516
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	8.673236994520686
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	12.860924341518075
O’Molloy.	25.70135441036497
—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	13.987201379606805
RETURN OF BLOOM —Yes, he said.	3.6970922231647863
I see them.	12.571336521239791
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: —Mr Crawford! A moment! —_Telegraph_! Racing special! —What is it?	10.67870505785324
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	13.171369992172943
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face: —Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR —Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	10.917376339430717
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	7.487355532013146
He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	16.428846998967103
After he’ll see.	12.049619738904799
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	24.479376207139932
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	17.323338571230835
I can have access to it in the national library.	19.704996423123134
House of keys, don’t you see?	10.090736084131434
His name is Keyes.	16.087374499820037
It’s a play on the name.	22.773807845340578
But he practically promised he’d give the renewal.	9.046370528201223
But he wants just a little puff.	19.52592772704117
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	32.05643669255302
K.M.A. —Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	22.853970540442276
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	13.585742961044694
Tell him that straight from the stable.	22.092300269660953
A bit nervy.	18.329227630491133
All off for a drink.	8.29485731209073
Arm in arm.	8.852658007216636
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	23.71033998572298
Usual blarney.	16.58211792698403
Wonder is that young Dedalus the moving spirit.	13.713652821868727
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	18.752190099672074
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	19.01744777546948
Been walking in muck somewhere.	6.929188866881258
Careless chap.	10.19448965235056
What was he doing in Irishtown?	15.800408750774864
—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par.	14.584047389996783
He’d give the ad, I think.	10.684634369110917
I’ll tell him...	6.8650345627806795
K.M.R.I.A. —He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	7.804597592113903
Any time he likes, tell him.	10.092963070808667
While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.	12.743797811021055
RAISING THE WIND —_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	7.9001779893372905
I’m up to here.	16.005811949707716
I’ve been through the hoop myself.	14.599023937633941
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	26.767164188618615
Sorry, Jack.	13.417466440764061
You must take the will for the deed.	28.009217278834615
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	21.651924669901405
O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	19.482011326289484
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	19.976370718429955
—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	15.338579031549179
—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	13.906805408510476
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.	8.811108042368906
SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID —That’s new, Myles Crawford said.	6.536704541487978
That’s copy.	35.36512466688197
Out for the waxies’ Dargle.	15.015321941313369
Two old trickies, what?	6.389764969880084
—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	17.25342274131016
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.	5.886550417762961
But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...	10.550758969011378
THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES —Easy all, Myles Crawford said.	3.6997166173156675
No poetic licence.	9.70564496856689
—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	15.707203714145752
—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	7.23806662633449
I like that.	6.063664006684156
I see the idea.	41.680996166658254
I see what you mean.	34.573581568989475
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF —It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	9.580343111091945
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	13.007614586798534
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	15.55874834974778
Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.	8.597257896640267
—Finished?	16.58211792698403
Myles Crawford said.	3.3263589130279745
So long as they do no worse.	13.88581450401634
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS.	5.504583264405476
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	11.148858409578036
ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.	7.082569710069092
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	16.997568493384314
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	11.986770364395124
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	28.847751458052098
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	10.61114674844265
Poor Penelope.	12.599684944605478
Penelope Rich.	23.60097507926347
They made ready to cross O’Connell street.	7.107623774156407

One and eightpence too much.	5.622904284508907
Hhhhm.	32.13581597679176
It’s the droll way he comes out with the things.	16.947623032949917
Knows how to tell a story too.	14.889046037645967
They wheeled lower.	14.786396833216765
Looking for grub.	18.329227630491133
He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball.	11.099515374559232
Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com.	5.970958933473835
Not a bit.	13.88581866556832
The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers.	10.807647279941435
Not such damn fools.	8.55639188197318
Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin’s King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern.	14.628419166486813
Live by their wits.	13.439721399175724
They wheeled, flapping.	13.698634017152093
The hungry famished gull Flaps o’er the waters dull.	4.2747447651948915
That is how poets write, the similar sounds.	14.033246270334656
But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse.	8.942677504656983
The flow of the language it is.	17.874781568760277
The thoughts.	10.19448965235056
Solemn.	32.13581597679176
Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.	12.519476612621055
—Two apples a penny! Two for a penny! His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand.	13.208272051407649
Australians they must be this time of year.	8.441889962152173
Those poor birds.	8.080465848484218
He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey.	11.467625480945198
See that?	6.267451463649378
The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey.	11.444195501705517
Gone.	17.685021073205338
Every morsel.	16.58211792698403
Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands.	7.439067927210072
They never expected that.	5.527052382837463

Wonder what kind is swanmeat.	14.64417236462177
Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.	13.722137580002071
I’m not going to throw any more.	9.604027972376322
Penny quite enough.	9.755383796628395
Lot of thanks I get.	14.05083171408554
Not even a caw.	19.66629825204986
They spread foot and mouth disease too.	4.6107052869164615
If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that.	5.889345210549799
Eat pig like pig.	7.622878559556313
But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty?	12.515994272980915
How is that?	6.242410509230411
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.	9.507086340561479
Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation.	21.515298332394472
How can you own water really?	9.028403472407344
It’s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace.	16.31847053232873

O! Eh?	21.23988525489042
No...	9.114635616592578
No. No, no.	20.90541886548148
I don’t believe it.	5.019929672285954
He wouldn’t surely?	17.08291274407657
No, no.	11.927758547445022
Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes.	12.73395187451981

Par it’s Greek: parallel, parallax.	9.166691040261261
Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration.	18.30753623225784
O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice.	18.24504198975312
Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.	13.814089193501319
She’s not exactly witty.	27.89443095808452
Blurt out what I was thinking.	10.977203354114925
Still, I don’t know.	9.681004952165901
She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice.	13.114707869860766
He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was singing into a barrel.	15.328991474952057
Now, isn’t that wit.	13.692221928384576
They used to call him big Ben.	15.34963669353243
Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone.	5.69275518240559
Appetite like an albatross.	13.439721399175724
Get outside of a baron of beef.	12.403505895983939

It all works out.	5.427425532297499
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards.	6.211082753761507
Bargains.	32.13581597679176
Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered.	18.393545523674437
He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H.	7.528832122972958

Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked.	9.370240705690057
Our staple food.	8.4492546945381
Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street.	12.234207859110835
Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly.	9.06896120212932
They are not Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men.	15.260646462032366
Doesn’t bring in any business either.	13.600845636896512
I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper.	4.011660235725624
I bet that would have caught on.	15.09999133401051
Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once.	6.550800420461826
Everyone dying to know what she’s writing.	19.364531589315842
Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing.	8.373560223178389
Have a finger in the pie.	42.9473876293958
Women too.	4.526169077416095
Curiosity.	32.13581597679176
Pillar of salt.	9.213318307935475
Wouldn’t have it of course because he didn’t think of it himself first.	16.351508565492274
Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid.	17.504637106271407
His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s potted under the obituaries, cold meat department.	10.420644946029894
You can’t lick ’em.	11.831656125544656
Our envelopes.	16.58211792698403
Hello, Jones, where are you going?	16.268288965885517
Can’t stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser _Kansell,_ sold by Hely’s Ltd, 85 Dame street.	11.145748416231447
Well out of that ruck I am.	13.645504809922222
Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents.	24.04478786989637
Tranquilla convent.	14.45922143842678
That was a nice nun there, really sweet face.	13.763686245165685
Wimple suited her small head.	5.719627020284742
I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes.	13.836877782197817
Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman.	9.2820205957258
I disturbed her at her devotions that morning.	8.07880944029447
But glad to communicate with the outside world.	11.760499171604396
Our great day, she said.	0.8806965927945696
Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.	7.043476078588657
Sweet name too: caramel.	15.22173120040065
She knew I, I think she knew by the way she.	19.51053972095889
If she had married she would have changed.	25.972008689372526
I suppose they really were short of money.	9.542285297538413
Fried everything in the best butter all the same.	13.733233973051513
No lard for them.	4.3526937332296125
My heart’s broke eating dripping.	18.225938960519347
They like buttering themselves in and out.	10.014937986130409
Molly tasting it, her veil up.	11.69423088301183

How long ago is that?	12.223362314548924
Year Phil Gilligan died.	6.347442741854127
We were in Lombard street west.	7.527323433434366
Wait: was in Thom’s.	7.746785708455016
Got the job in Wisdom Hely’s year we married.	10.518740285016111
Six years.	9.105249025485831
Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that’s right the big fire at Arnott’s.	8.955188736905711

Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman.	21.087058014835296
Couldn’t hear what the band played.	18.583058195601012
For what we have already received may the Lord make us.	9.689057542987381
Milly was a kiddy then.	10.776903079119855
Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs.	14.402263776014538
Mantailored with selfcovered buttons.	6.791212737248195
She didn’t like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf.	10.074037626273018
As if that.	14.36678848653273
Old Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	11.694836873278419
Flies’ picnic too.	3.933142572693838
Never put a dress on her back like it.	11.62099033306243
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	13.280283811768578
Just beginning to plump it out well.	14.745378670098955
Rabbitpie we had that day.	17.37291599003771
People looking after her.	6.776964122212439
Happy.	22.281730317965827
Happier then.	6.817466119191894
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	19.139084956365505
Dockrell’s, one and ninepence a dozen.	17.745230897952776
Milly’s tubbing night.	14.481811493177156
American soap I bought: elderflower.	11.93585552671273
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	32.10593333978855
Funny she looked soaped all over.	6.943175160587353
Shapely too.	5.167893237494866
Now photography.	16.58211792698403
Poor papa’s daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	17.18044501866118
He walked along the curbstone.	15.36831939414859
Stream of life.	4.845299384305662
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed?	24.182726309196706
Weak eyes, woman.	19.59745554895661
Pen something.	8.732813016406928
Pendennis?	32.13581597679176
My memory is getting.	10.82639741088797
Pen ...?	9.413552088657418
Of course it’s years ago.	16.156851609917762
Noise of the trams probably.	16.875134579871006
Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he sees every day.	19.795775112490208
Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	12.972791144222265
Seeing her home after practice.	9.54325740212424
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	15.761297800394184
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	11.794542856300422
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	14.093274418222826
He and I behind.	17.19074657181136
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	25.77467090567749
Lucky it didn’t.	6.327772525450383
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	14.05113979292773
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	23.50260923582636
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot.	18.967671656199144
His farewell concerts.	11.148858409578036
Positively last appearance on any stage.	8.728704322625479
May be for months and may be for never.	14.025142907606115
Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up.	11.859169251070337
Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	7.255653542160594
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	9.484266095340946
She did get flushed in the wind.	11.23138432604051
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	10.157153788286456
And the mulled rum.	17.16984587791094
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	16.138140189738614
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	7.665076485463351
Always warm from her.	6.1193580268217325
Always liked to let her self out.	7.672958075441412
Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins.	9.86096722379839
Happy.	22.281730317965827
Happy.	22.281730317965827
That was the night...	10.153382539127549
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	13.44969321628159
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	21.44770385579107
—No use complaining.	28.762954200150126
How is Molly those times?	10.686094495677366
Haven’t seen her for ages.	14.166972429903941
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	15.604554162472674
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	12.018409201191325
—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?	10.008853121883035
In a photographer’s there.	18.398320521119622
Getting on like a house on fire.	15.403470954136727
How are all your charges?	23.87371363615575
—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.	14.068406685988318
How many has she?	15.634109298935872
—You’re in black, I see.	15.226227207800585
You have no...	8.268066594862447
—No, Mr Bloom said.	3.567130678681989
I have just come from a funeral.	22.762579432198493
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	31.213244724751412
Who’s dead, when and what did he die of?	31.649666621224238
Turn up like a bad penny.	16.63660139573802
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	11.507661195363687
I hope it wasn’t any near relation.	12.858168888445201
May as well get her sympathy.	12.403375689282338
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	4.896830048932352
An old friend of mine.	11.175538727442909
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	8.544327996333061
Heart trouble, I believe.	23.03169236473823
Funeral was this morning.	6.798615624033688
Your funeral’s tomorrow While you’re coming through the rye.	15.487429607299097
—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.	19.126256327666024
Now that’s quite enough about that.	9.573907720834786
Just: quietly: husband.	6.885448833811102
—And your lord and master?	17.246601394471757
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes.	10.218041682501182
Hasn’t lost them anyhow.	10.678059104908849
—O, don’t be talking! she said.	5.603567069556953
He’s a caution to rattlesnakes.	11.998028991753309
He’s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	23.790272153772086
He has me heartscalded.	22.285149194782047
Wait till I show you.	5.157711015881923
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison’s.	4.117902541192773
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet.	11.807972530134537
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they’d taste it with the hot tea.	13.521618729528731
Or is it from her?	25.644031270752446
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	4.343282147137768
Pleasure or pain is it?	3.7842292195692635
Penny dinner.	11.725328032605423
Knife and fork chained to the table.	6.911204854181595
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	7.3326503106833325
Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things.	9.661233824702109
Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram.	53.20087333667888
Rummaging.	32.13581597679176
Open.	32.13581597679176
Money.	32.13581597679176
Please take one.	6.905893153237362
Devils if they lose sixpence.	11.543974298416831
Raise Cain.	16.58211792698403
Husband barging.	16.58211792698403
Are you feeding your little brother’s family?	21.013498998308993
Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	8.55639188197318
Pastille that was fell.	16.80849215514561
What is she?...	6.5125792805137435
—There must be a new moon out, she said.	2.2710944570228557
He’s always bad then.	9.898734072506647
Do you know what he did last night?	15.149150938737057
Her hand ceased to rummage.	13.611962862732073
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
Look straight in her eyes.	5.834040462360893
I believe you.	16.581724334394256
—Woke me up in the night, she said.	2.440235707532345
Dream he had, a nightmare.	40.234527028260096
Indiges.	32.13581597679176
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	6.213291144913133
—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.	5.604416847407302
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	22.54201530250599
—Read that, she said.	0.7330258013612543
He got it this morning.	11.539287605613007
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	23.67067800123387
U.	12.75310702185393
P.?	34.8450835000072
—U.	8.291058963492015
p: up, she said.	0.8968246162294161
Someone taking a rise out of him.	6.281367067087189
It’s a great shame for them whoever he is.	11.309905661177828
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	5.588104533828867
She took back the card, sighing.	17.67536140777813
—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office.	19.228770402976416
He’s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	13.23950409823326
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	9.650339767364123
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	15.642995771794775
Seen its best days.	5.336000317789429
Wispish hair over her ears.	10.77921854012837
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	5.654816316926632
Shabby genteel.	16.58211792698403
She used to be a tasty dresser.	13.017875747081705
Lines round her mouth.	9.40178340344906
Only a year or so older than Molly.	10.048841860047272
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	23.63475791076608
Cruel.	25.50621404370786
The unfair sex.	8.949652011548354
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	18.88717449644437
I’m hungry too.	8.833598098119031
Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.	10.53250370814019
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	5.877689251470581
Josie Powell that was.	7.0001058055750764
In Luke Doyle’s long ago.	8.635824270594442
Dolphin’s Barn, the charades.	30.519364896640706
U.	12.75310702185393
Change the subject.	13.149519785874272
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	23.462703185718002
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	13.219213891736556
Playgoers’ Club.	13.29830072003241
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	17.93672436547866
Did I pull the chain?	14.57104946464556
Yes.	9.732442163148734
The last act.	16.00355261287225
She’s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street.	9.874617858603761
Dr Horne got her in.	10.172720526535526
She’s three days bad now.	11.899022248103801
—O, Mr Bloom said.	5.075877196581161
I’m sorry to hear that.	6.188293011726585
—Yes, Mrs Breen said.	7.379045745123391
And a houseful of kids at home.	7.16519401180109
It’s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	15.57322030491063
—O, Mr Bloom said.	5.075877196581161
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	6.219865340683751
His tongue clacked in compassion.	7.848394559256099
Dth! Dth! —I’m sorry to hear that, he said.	6.768903883931795
Poor thing! Three days! That’s terrible for her.	8.866061451956849
Mrs Breen nodded.	17.298843081232643
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	10.000318511318044
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: —Mind! Let this man pass.	10.031233881264507
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	11.545028733443928
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	7.670634034802464
From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.	22.600402659285166
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	3.9758568933950875
He always walks outside the lampposts.	11.63843667478531
Mrs Breen asked.	11.231729628754515
Is he dotty?	23.800675310486728
—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling.	7.174701447757857
Watch! —He has enough of them, she said.	4.269126448036714
Denis will be like that one of these days.	13.174344867031516
She broke off suddenly.	9.90202010094519
—There he is, she said.	0.7889311710632342
I must go after him.	10.98714183270066
Goodbye.	32.13581597679176
Remember me to Molly, won’t you?	10.344529534640271
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	9.730273337812331
Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison’s hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs.	10.610212044187131
Blown in from the bay.	14.941915104194129
Like old times.	6.256341459304021
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.	9.47100964290541
Meshuggah.	32.13581597679176
Off his chump.	11.148858409578036
Going the two days.	16.974762014865682
Watch him! Out he goes again.	9.82241693070919
One way of getting on in the world.	17.052985866742286
And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds.	14.228107229816136
Hard time she must have with him.	7.838512704572649
U.	12.75310702185393
I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.	14.91953879875808
Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything.	19.2676120791894
Round to Menton’s office.	8.22758128631471
His oyster eyes staring at the postcard.	19.23541733735224
Be a feast for the gods.	17.040277575033233
He passed the _Irish Times_.	21.16133463148752
There might be other answers lying there.	6.375081588946616

They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone.	21.9706053021405

What was he saying?	18.859607033877435
The ends of the world with a Scotch accent.	13.845511633725797
Tentacles: octopus.	11.148858409578036
Something occult: symbolism.	8.55639188197318
Holding forth.	12.599684944605478
She’s taking it all in.	21.691402950462813

Bad as a bloater.	21.697118538726276
Dreams all night.	6.624072486486697
Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak?	20.35884728801007
Nutarians.	32.13581597679176
To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak.	17.37046012756487
Absurd.	32.13581597679176
Salty too.	5.167893237494866
They cook in soda.	8.55639188197318
Keep you sitting by the tap all night.	7.039589841713815

Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic.	7.082569710069092
Esthetes they are.	7.359930466275037
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.	16.605191598291633
For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him.	7.137295261052173

He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses.	9.242072634098554
Or will I drop into old Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair?	9.440510352773865
Wellmannered fellow.	8.909322665144582

Unclaimed money too.	5.81836797873934
There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.	15.088406778426311
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides.	18.88745790690123
Can’t see it.	6.533518084899033
If you imagine it’s there you can almost see it.	17.363327072478036
Can’t see it.	6.533518084899033
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm’s length towards the sun.	16.505394940449545
Wanted to try that often.	12.14872672933266
Yes: completely.	15.385997865521036
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk.	23.21372664332455
Must be the focus where the rays cross.	13.896046672050051
If I had black glasses.	13.337012709623394
Interesting.	32.13581597679176
There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west.	8.521911439500048

Must go out there some first Saturday of the month.	18.73750832889163
If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family.	9.240400825866537

A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart.	7.004860805202913
He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock.	11.576944156487745

O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.	18.708819946643178
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin.	14.602794557188757
Herring’s blush.	39.76832468340524
Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete.	7.053503920582632
Too much fat on the parsnips.	24.5667033172144

Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?	24.092657736430823
—I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered.	11.875065898487234
I never put anything on a horse.	26.127895132420498
—You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said.	6.671172778759204
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese.	11.255116545993216
Sips of his wine soothed his palate.	15.30726618861769
Not logwood that.	4.346761424078208
Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.	7.198447868586436
Nice piece of wood in that counter.	18.216455560277215
Nicely planed.	16.58211792698403
Like the way it curves there.	9.46960779144923
—I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said.	8.600071069439554

Davy Byrne said...	4.764895027231538
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.	16.17790071568578
—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	22.548588649109895
That was a rare bit of horseflesh.	28.57784228501053

He put me off it.	10.1151803770445
Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	23.074465697774347
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	20.765440022134243
Nosey numbskull.	16.58211792698403
He knows already.	16.792156254453165
Better let him forget.	20.04828590315136

Taste it better because I’m not thirsty.	13.027010770599148
Bath of course does that.	13.626557795180602
Just a bite or two.	14.807155357571364

All the odd things people pick up for food.	13.497835727972266
Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook.	18.56938234224925

Green by Drumleck.	11.148858409578036
Yellowgreen towards Sutton.	11.148858409578036
Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.	8.326471513281959
Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you’ll toss me all.	14.327000584588742
O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	7.391629271743973
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	11.597101653817184

High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants.	4.676054234667242
Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded.	6.14633179370776
Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman’s breasts full in her blouse of nun’s veiling, fat nipples upright.	14.569502337860666
Hot I tongued her.	3.998638361732222
She kissed me.	4.150460101210741
I was kissed.	36.06383918061128

They have no.	10.269361922422817
Never looked.	10.19448965235056
I’ll look today.	10.925421266396672
Keeper won’t see.	5.437684929306166
Bend down let something fall see if she.	8.707569958554593
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	29.92979571223015
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	13.761888017701741
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: —What is this he is?	21.79269802259762
Isn’t he in the insurance line?	21.986180736025812
—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	12.096081459718585
He does canvassing for the _Freeman._ —I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	14.98357952199822
Is he in trouble?	20.164457427564866
—Trouble?	16.58211792698403
Nosey Flynn said.	2.911555615169485
Not that I heard of.	12.846709227535188
Why?	12.497976142926124
—I noticed he was in mourning.	21.294982486579254
—Was he?	9.582020471838792
Nosey Flynn said.	2.911555615169485
So he was, faith.	13.185871244046561
I asked him how was all at home.	10.798854301579762
You’re right, by God.	15.565204529126351
So he was.	11.473685730081534
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	16.89775824370909
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	14.806332361135109
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	8.162327109922646
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	17.10121127655772
She’s well nourished, I tell you.	9.849410225217508
Plovers on toast.	9.70564496856689
—And is he doing for the _Freeman?_ Davy Byrne said.	12.957801286323527
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	8.61020205249918
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.	11.023148498270844
You can make bacon of that.	9.757909186652281
—How so?	15.699731022472692
He winked.	13.943843522115227
—He’s in the craft, he said.	7.151601727970649
—Do you tell me so?	19.816340186122122
Davy Byrne said.	2.8236388194851725
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	4.054979555782916
Ancient free and accepted order.	9.980003968332298
He’s an excellent brother.	14.340173920356378
Light, life and love, by God.	15.70442512274059
They give him a leg up.	8.220882305789628
I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.	21.403127299366542
—Is that a fact?	6.943180104884628
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	7.570282062192495
They stick to you when you’re down.	9.200469747938067
I know a fellow was trying to get into it.	13.170215021256999
But they’re as close as damn it.	6.084155504922806
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	13.184848333484672
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: —Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! —There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	23.227493088865288
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	12.464225999183876
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	14.592541398885663
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: —And is that a fact?	11.981281373074195
Decent quiet man he is.	4.771413159956671
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.	26.09540725296795
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	13.800270084859418
Slips off when the fun gets too hot.	12.499031224725194
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?	29.590486669293412
Ah, you weren’t there.	20.043411000236976
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	36.077635036290594
Declare to God he does.	11.319267479356881
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	7.506088594866728
He’s a safe man, I’d say.	12.328156090832715
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	8.753864312667238
He’s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	14.667054281107221
Give the devil his due.	16.175262594099227
O, Bloom has his good points.	33.31060952250973
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.	16.015325229078538
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	8.220636379048353
—I know, Davy Byrne said.	5.635999601474956
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	5.82688015691703
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	9.422682581546786
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	14.248934833900009
—Day, Mr Byrne.	19.80266366685885
—Day, gentlemen.	8.34827454070424
—Who’s standing?	30.77583405256389
Paddy Leonard asked.	6.163806768696359
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	9.143854366634214
—Well, what’ll it be?	20.56279816612134
Paddy Leonard asked.	6.163806768696359
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	7.617949278753263
—How much?	16.633517878935717
Paddy Leonard cried.	11.797006239002885
Since when, for God’ sake?	25.805926721165257
What’s yours, Tom?	34.16838638893169
—How is the main drainage?	30.381928811785638
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	26.99073107910361
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	11.303509554939387
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	22.30234121404904
he said.	3.724527490343976
—Certainly, sir.	4.085666375298969
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	11.611637525856056
Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	9.329915102453716
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	14.22304882789966
A dead snip.	14.786396833216765
—Zinfandel is it?	4.1182085903008225
Nosey Flynn asked.	11.179288679328046
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	10.154123958645418
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	17.241121718711195
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	5.1194610447686095
—Is it Zinfandel?	18.341630324234423
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	9.778399057842206
I’m going to plunge five bob on my own.	8.472741708503287
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	6.732778548097365
Who gave it to you?	6.805624084826168
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	18.9630930301386
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.	4.448738055594205
The others turned.	10.01942386405799
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.	14.207400053291256
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	8.679516985455932
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	14.236485520394302
—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.	9.188840286079756
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	5.2345727019672985
A suckingbottle for the baby.	11.871064540255894
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	20.57189556934937
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	12.661659108568635
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	8.843389850982536
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	9.605607997709779
Surfeit.	32.13581597679176
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	5.039775617670823
First sweet then savoury.	8.55639188197318
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	23.48138369895383
Ruminants.	32.13581597679176
His second course.	6.486525774962426
Their upper jaw they move.	5.810082344558442
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	19.649480108895908
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.	13.828701218468954
Lean people long mouths.	7.622878559556313
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	15.064641839615973
Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.	13.503944990628526
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M’invitasti.	10.283409848955971
Feel better.	12.429226669332564

Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	10.396559442298605
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	10.52034360558734
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	17.168100776583543
Science.	25.50621404370786
—_A cenar teco._ What does that _teco_ mean?	6.41418137945431
Tonight perhaps.	7.491817491458749
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	10.140964388200404

Her voice floating out.	6.074221885016354
Those lovely seaside girls.	4.827935436568134
Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	5.980655097960725
Handy man wants job.	5.654928602187042
Small wages.	16.58211792698403
Will eat anything.	7.184257632960914
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.	19.49625064677254
_Why I left the church of Rome?	11.261221556360299

Same bait.	16.58211792698403
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.	13.34649803064442
No tram in sight.	10.089288358970672
Wants to cross.	24.399779783135752
—Do you want to cross?	14.30514785969375
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
The blind stripling did not answer.	11.946256828885565
His wallface frowned weakly.	7.622878559556313
He moved his head uncertainly.	25.03926123201027
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	7.257915034700875
Molesworth street is opposite.	8.279211252996465
Do you want to cross?	18.92043832100815
There’s nothing in the way.	19.72672769617978
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	6.602979053505609
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s.	8.504153044006317
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	10.821467937765691
Horse drooping.	16.58211792698403
Driver in John Long’s.	5.852407553473261
Slaking his drouth.	11.869655286702958
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.	11.728374237868758
I’ll see you across.	12.552114912656947
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?	24.12386064571187
—Yes, the stripling answered.	22.10711673279567
South Frederick street.	5.0439916582115565
—Come, Mr Bloom said.	5.224520948676813
Say something to him.	0.6488100969897576
Better not do the condescending.	22.27319064482377
They mistrust what you tell them.	10.382101047611078
Pass a common remark.	6.5432824295768865
—The rain kept off.	9.146192802853154
Stains on his coat.	14.765292329591233
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	9.43853565530161
Tastes all different for him.	3.902590599166072
Have to be spoonfed first.	16.268817023701196
Like a child’s hand, his hand.	18.330239993414335
Like Milly’s was.	9.807282926681713
Sensitive.	32.13581597679176
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	10.756212588034332
Wonder if he has a name.	23.309457866904225
Van.	32.13581597679176
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	12.251517343580401
That’s right.	10.764254900789322
Clear.	32.13581597679176
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	14.319195473174068
—Thanks, sir.	6.441906133552355
Knows I’m a man.	9.75820612184742
—Right now?	11.063433575707966
First turn to the left.	12.74669423297298
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	15.345705159743256
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	16.041259065363672
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	13.3567934962918
Must have felt it.	11.522491962622333
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	13.274435869326528
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	13.006234879035931
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	15.500514730206136
Feel a gap.	14.786396833216765
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	15.710227066762274
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane?	14.585141643889003
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	16.634776345767822
Penrose! That was that chap’s name.	19.54613585548743
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	22.53602866681017
Read with their fingers.	12.623002343977452
Tune pianos.	16.58211792698403
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	13.64582082307951
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	8.894559173562998
Of course the other senses are more.	16.390443762899572
Embroider.	32.13581597679176
Plait baskets.	16.58211792698403
People ought to help.	31.385320588163818
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.	17.553225889316646
Hates sewing.	16.58211792698403
Might take an objection.	13.698634017152093
Dark men they call them.	5.762044331358329
Sense of smell must be stronger too.	5.38018158655229
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	6.318921486372865
Each street different smell.	6.5432824295768865
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	26.609217766135814
Tastes?	32.13581597679176
They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	14.24986772064748
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	12.571977974191043
And with a woman, for instance.	19.400711177593504
More shameless not seeing.	12.116599241714928
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	8.456883810151389
Look at me.	10.791679986292062
I have them all on.	20.644267514491524
Must be strange not to see her.	13.549035707166178
Kind of a form in his mind’s eye.	22.303317807184257
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	20.059843574109664
His hands on her hair, for instance.	26.012892056388885
Say it was black, for instance.	26.957830053066054
We call it black.	14.746202268967124
Then passing over her white skin.	10.910323977507502
Different feel perhaps.	5.9045683139513
Feeling of white.	14.353755873802056
Postoffice.	32.13581597679176
Must answer.	8.425917152462297
Fag today.	7.274431494472446
Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown.	8.764450672749067
Accept my little present.	10.732243914289368
Stationer’s just here too.	13.605924281200856
Think over it.	3.5691947564589017
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	10.035447741970838
Again.	20.244295502353957
Fibres of fine fine straw.	9.061898412748604
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	16.760943734827478
Downy hair there too.	5.655236633311433
Not smooth enough.	7.355503433762563
The belly is the smoothest.	25.195689605998563
There he goes into Frederick street.	6.544120965501817
Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.	9.890454980911317
Might be settling my braces.	10.876325581925839
Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	17.587086560306894
But I know it’s whitey yellow.	27.04469560067209
Want to try in the dark to see.	22.0348305583917
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	7.886160705403903
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	7.846755081090927
Terrible.	32.13581597679176
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	21.309722234101304
Where is the justice being born that way?	16.759773843819353
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	5.305209351299667
Holocaust.	32.13581597679176
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	6.443514899064904
Dear, dear, dear.	11.867608938927452
Pity, of course: but somehow you can’t cotton on to them someway.	17.084230981185744
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall.	9.231097497670403
Solemn as Troy.	8.949652011548354
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	8.876286351887305
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	6.14633179370776
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	14.33541472121059
I sentenced him to ten years.	9.330626054660728
I suppose he’d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	18.850615830971776
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	17.305931752234777
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.	21.578837016905005
Wellmeaning old man.	6.194277191590501
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	4.6876173240857035
Sends them to the rightabout.	22.055726276200858
The devil on moneylenders.	13.439721399175724
Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling.	17.27054674089072
Now he’s really what they call a dirty jew.	13.204123520819573
Power those judges have.	5.151346752820949
Crusty old topers in wigs.	7.082569710069092
Bear with a sore paw.	27.354204257110585
And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.	5.0638931085698315
Hello, placard.	26.709855241378172
Mirus bazaar.	30.869685532944267
His Excellency the lord lieutenant.	12.3638583526786
Sixteenth.	32.13581597679176
Today it is.	5.567660174041145
In aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital.	8.24310461027317
_The Messiah_ was first given for that.	3.5091179287960403
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Handel.	32.13581597679176
What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	26.02141356378177
Drop in on Keyes.	15.105566283456794
No use sticking to him like a leech.	4.04521222825836
Wear out my welcome.	6.347442741854127
Sure to know someone on the gate.	17.332575216232236
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	16.849543881412057
First I must.	17.69581003753541
Library.	32.13581597679176
Straw hat in sunlight.	17.457227664880605
Tan shoes.	12.599684944605478
Turnedup trousers.	9.85978631029179
It is.	10.115469952702798
It is.	10.115469952702798
His heart quopped softly.	7.8277021418315265
To the right.	13.090082977259781
Museum.	25.50621404370786
Goddesses.	32.13581597679176
He swerved to the right.	7.743988268251786
Is it?	15.20636352830389
Almost certain.	16.58211792698403
Wine in my face.	14.444211356669694
Why did I?	11.011712678102528
Too heady.	16.58211792698403
Yes, it is.	7.643385578774121
The walk.	9.324810169522841
Not see.	6.03491677736451
Get on.	5.909382163877581
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	9.727428466994326
Handsome building.	16.58211792698403
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	9.910497547215114
Not following me?	8.755193304665461
Didn’t see me perhaps.	9.311908783325121
Light in his eyes.	7.054374891265032
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	15.45820802604635
Quick.	22.281730317965827
Cold statues: quiet there.	5.093964580111286
Safe in a minute.	18.051433367622106
No. Didn’t see me.	9.080588186644098
After two.	8.909322665144582
Just at the gate.	13.348183337702599
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	7.577868041869707
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	17.04477063641339
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim.	10.75397230976276
Where did I?	9.033357585366183
Busy looking.	9.85978631029179
He thrust back quick Agendath.	8.665330132049261
Afternoon she said.	3.577786851059557
I am looking for that.	16.247190682207737
Yes, that.	14.8017907508225
Try all pockets.	7.355503433762563
Handker.	32.13581597679176
_Freeman._ Where did I?	9.085168087745776
Trousers.	25.50621404370786
Potato.	32.13581597679176
Purse.	32.13581597679176
Where?	14.036610527842967
Hurry.	25.50621404370786
Walk quietly.	9.85978631029179
Moment more.	7.145629591813955
My heart.	13.384024233730612
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	14.744106202813692
Gate.	32.13581597679176
Safe! [ 9 ] Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred: —And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of _Wilhelm Meister_.	14.452166363207562
A great poet on a great brother poet.	15.882633002187475
A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	5.7021597463870695
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	11.989193996128769
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	9.530867374026805
—Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering.	11.226918959703047
The beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts.	6.312677030981712
One always feels that Goethe’s judgments are so true.	10.580745355235232
True in the larger analysis.	29.457358053356845
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	4.279649039106256
Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was gone.	19.754557084756158
Two left.	8.909322665144582
—Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes before his death.	9.553817876040723
—Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with elder’s gall, to write _Paradise Lost_ at your dictation?	10.64193228107142
_The Sorrows of Satan_ he calls it.	5.719762584451858
Smile.	25.50621404370786
Smile Cranly’s smile.	17.252529421302025
First he tickled her Then he patted her Then he passed the female catheter For he was a medical Jolly old medi...	8.035532112590298
—I feel you would need one more for _Hamlet._ Seven is dear to the mystic mind.	14.270514245673423
The shining seven W.B. calls them.	7.681228794601619
He laughed low: a sizar’s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.	16.380304492848353
Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood Tears such as angels weep.	8.552031388435333
Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.	5.504583264405476
He holds my follies hostage.	10.42980595095267
Cranly’s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland.	10.237130488634273
Gaptoothed Kathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.	15.001046553324981
And one more to hail him: _ave, rabbi_: the Tinahely twelve.	12.041803265761489
In the shadow of the glen he cooees for them.	9.72125917060013
My soul’s youth I gave him, night by night.	16.265563030823166
God speed.	23.60097507926347
Good hunting.	16.58211792698403
Mulligan has my telegram.	7.622878559556313
Folly.	32.13581597679176
Persist.	32.13581597679176
—Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare’s Hamlet though I admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.	11.491826125017347
—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	9.249335840190254
I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.	8.948944100037659
Clergymen’s discussions of the historicity of Jesus.	28.17937759404204
Art has to reveal to us ideas, formless spiritual essences.	6.661775869407594
The supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring.	11.176607727258501
The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas.	10.80226866684082
All the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.	13.839347530180575
A.	9.643960518690632
E.	10.582866589593744
has been telling some yankee interviewer.	8.824101425504809
Wall, tarnation strike me! —The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.	12.337394446316415
Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.	18.90270099909477
—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	9.67096318291328
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	16.407153213540887
He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.	17.9574325483782
Formless spiritual.	16.58211792698403
Father, Word and Holy Breath.	10.886284035956425
Allfather, the heavenly man.	15.88407291896436
Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who suffers in us at every moment.	11.016908155354479
This verily is that.	9.704887212402868
I am the fire upon the altar.	26.754724970989244
I am the sacrificial butter.	11.844999444473155

Brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help.	14.928742597368425

The life esoteric is not for ordinary person.	9.638699043193274
O.P. must work off bad karma first.	7.135883432109873
Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister H.P.B.’s elemental.	7.6724887543312175
O, fie! Out on’t! _Pfuiteufel!_ You naughtn’t to look, missus, so you naughtn’t when a lady’s ashowing of her elemental.	21.619185738149344
Mr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light.	15.223132483060889
—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.	10.67489896010446
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: —Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	11.260602199542749
—Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his commonwealth?	39.05935810827301
Unsheathe your dagger definitions.	8.55639188197318
Streams of tendency and eons they worship.	4.603213429811252
God: noise in the street: very peripatetic.	15.062881194447705
Space: what you damn well have to see.	19.05430360942806
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.	7.7636002840841725
Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.	33.975338604598925
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	15.009337027927852
—Haines is gone, he said.	5.16679253609175
—Is he?	17.818198139900908
—I was showing him Jubainville’s book.	22.745340488691212
He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t you know, about Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn’t bring him in to hear the discussion.	14.13943218079547
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.	10.416801659201397
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick To greet the callous public.	6.835402906366376
Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish In lean unlovely English.	8.014680937488638
—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	24.017874921201916
We feel in England.	8.454414209270656
Penitent thief.	16.58211792698403
Gone.	17.685021073205338
I smoked his baccy.	8.55639188197318
Green twinkling stone.	7.554588130286805
An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	13.218176438843491
—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly.	9.879764674694163
For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.	16.47274366932359
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song.	11.69548967475052
France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.	16.495598543775664
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	6.669967516879317
—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	10.109006570145858
The one about _Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don’t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	5.846390534782128
He describes _Hamlet_ given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.	11.472250902336707
They advertised it.	3.757377520435574
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	4.168978779241143
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown: —_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don’t you know.	5.979941450421488
It’s so French.	18.56969917201688
The French point of view.	12.468514972858452
_Hamlet ou_...	2.739065420347036
—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	25.258920053931124
John Eglinton laughed.	17.211670858452916
—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	10.30483983968181
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	13.999930554463738
—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	11.17102391001184
Not for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	11.809190612385798
Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.	13.121532271119966
Our Father who art in purgatory.	11.255165814575383
Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.	6.626863169889884
The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.	10.849895995540844
Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	9.667670690028649
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared...	3.689518831656632
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	9.149624158605588
The devil and the deep sea.	20.532732249311273
—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best’s behoof.	23.380463735225906
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	13.836404499863193
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	10.103841294389518
If thou didst ever...	3.7728818950828167
—What is a ghost?	39.612874900440815
Stephen said with tingling energy.	17.53332504449079
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	10.0924477849406
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	4.742980975388763
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	9.649715484925112
Who is King Hamlet?	18.10126204029607
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	22.3389982214019
—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swift glance their hearing.	18.69117763329477
The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.	23.110264404339578
The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.	12.657150454586235
Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.	7.380977294697166
Local colour.	12.599684944605478
Work in all you know.	11.856381096833461
Make them accomplices.	11.148858409578036
—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	15.341741738819312
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	10.951021259385852
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	5.1874452789876
Composition of place.	9.121241528830698
Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me! —The play begins.	16.10947396177671
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	18.051320479641536
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	25.471128473952717
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit, bidding him list.	12.4075292451717
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	14.765535979747368
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	15.987418090330092
—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	30.28120506153586
Art thou there, truepenny?	14.034530699298749
—Interesting only to the parish clerk.	15.280714735590674
I mean, we have the plays.	24.37923229313813
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle has said.	6.215726247051914
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts.	18.061642535448435
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	31.095197982331754
Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.	14.654768029187792
Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...	10.197703838024456
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	10.22341208014448
Marry, I wanted it.	11.47890627332517
Take thou this noble.	8.55639188197318
Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s daughter.	17.97791584022186
Agenbite of inwit.	7.496728605607897
Do you intend to pay it back?	25.740003329910905
O, yes.	9.816447708694117
When?	18.7931391896167
Now?	25.50621404370786
Well...	3.168254680321378
No. When, then?	31.931074960657217
I paid my way.	4.031814515714551
I paid my way.	4.031814515714551
Steady on.	5.909382163877581
He’s from beyant Boyne water.	9.381171046917606
The northeast corner.	6.486525774962426
You owe it.	3.757377520435574
Five months.	13.943843522115227
Molecules all change.	7.554588130286805
I am other I now.	11.776160557896677
Other I got pound.	13.253521503845949
Buzz.	22.281730317965827
Buzz.	22.281730317965827
But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.	8.915606902774414
I that sinned and prayed and fasted.	9.499678199286942
A child Conmee saved from pandies.	10.288111764400162
I, I and I.	21.847832220076427
A.E.I.O.U. —Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?	21.559044583557476
John Eglinton’s carping voice asked.	10.60792946178384
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	8.616507728603569
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	16.754407910629684
—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	11.22399967327905
She saw him into and out of the world.	10.603428405238107
She took his first embraces.	30.97329783846693
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	18.323289408894773
Mother’s deathbed.	32.43225330869794
Candle.	32.13581597679176
The sheeted mirror.	7.791124599957709
Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers.	9.253098915520106
_Liliata rutilantium._ I wept alone.	7.2300527140819435
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	27.065173002178827
—Bosh! Stephen said rudely.	18.262350305923512
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	17.40447763202683
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	8.816847860034109
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	9.245618114510412
—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	12.266473919304598
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	5.039775617670823
—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	24.743111579865932
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	17.730939790421886
But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	8.961767583050644
—But Ann Hathaway?	16.493411901723267
Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.	17.559203525304458
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	12.552433335968416
—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	13.894212162353178
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.	8.695988048517728
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	8.665330132049261
Hortensio calls her young and beautiful.	13.325915828762168
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	15.331620203185363
Good: he left her and gained the world of men.	15.707952630166156
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	16.96762521535794
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	11.848153216080743
He chose badly?	11.148858409578036
He was chosen, it seems to me.	6.810449905825021
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	5.444332186509466
By cock, she was to blame.	3.416110393813524
She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix.	18.865514117794707
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	8.979005476441593
And my turn?	19.541794883363302
When?	18.7931391896167
Come! —Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	11.087181647500984
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	11.365389599628868
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	17.243768138585125
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.	4.8200972035702545
—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._ Whither away?	23.839440838657378
Exploitable ground.	9.324810169522841
—Are you going?	10.453129583041692
John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked.	9.986187927125174
Shall we see you at Moore’s tonight?	17.291408019338014
Piper is coming.	7.668010657775185
—Piper! Mr Best piped.	18.35740045600652
Is Piper back?	8.949652011548354
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	5.429207406302529
—I don’t know if I can.	18.17291454424641
Thursday.	20.244295502353957
We have our meeting.	18.702042374089732
If I can get away in time.	14.564307289100949
Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.	10.82639741088797
_Isis Unveiled._ Their Pali book we tried to pawn.	7.660692525699971
Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec logos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.	5.092300019822857
The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him.	4.01545643571633
Louis H.	7.5719552805519275
Victory.	32.13581597679176
Caulfield Irwin.	16.58211792698403
Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow.	9.352620495606969
Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain.	16.82976509214953
Gulfer of souls, engulfer.	14.409174245289329
Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls.	5.159809600568937
Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.	6.403526109638277
In quintessential triviality For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	7.4713881935312205
—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	19.613433593018865
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses.	7.493265800069684
We are all looking forward anxiously.	10.883713353484895
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	10.320320084532238
See this.	8.425917152462297
Remember.	25.50621404370786
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee.	14.26427813539063
Touch lightly with two index fingers.	8.998391234332777
Aristotle’s experiment.	32.054572760526554
One or two?	32.451677561488125
Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	30.397691310023315
Argal, one hat is one hat.	14.892609940416392
Listen.	18.793139189616713
Young Colum and Starkey.	7.622878559556313
George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	7.50759609323246
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he?	22.062593543324756
I liked Colum’s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	15.014418921209577
Do you think he has genius really?	18.645395854893078
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth a Grecian vase_.	4.914571811832721
Did he?	19.28864306075007
I hope you’ll be able to come tonight.	15.187670658574271
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	13.256542429971908
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	20.265340641762588
Did you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn?	12.131300567389163
That Moore is Martyn’s wild oats?	14.039350501070578
Awfully clever, isn’t it?	3.627815510974599
They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.	8.199687503530033
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.	9.580428491840342
Moore is the man for it.	12.405596158106896
A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.	9.848681253610659
With a saffron kilt?	17.721138192069
O’Neill Russell?	22.511480456742834
O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.	25.440352512840114
And his Dulcinea?	19.16681357793786
James Stephens is doing some clever sketches.	8.701344767030145
We are becoming important, it seems.	9.93966541602558
Cordelia.	32.13581597679176
_Cordoglio._ Lir’s loneliest daughter.	15.00253760730934
Nookshotten.	32.13581597679176
—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	12.3161100582236
If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...	14.448502911912396
—O, yes.	8.172202916946212
If he considers it important it will go in.	6.828455549775385
We have so much correspondence.	27.69866558343176
—I understand, Stephen said.	9.727470016466123
Thanks.	20.244295502353957
God ild you.	4.323639040703681
The pigs’ paper.	7.354318107919548
Bullockbefriending.	32.13581597679176
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too.	4.650510996977064
Are we going to be read?	24.668958104213388
The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.	12.976552957537889
I hope you will come round tonight.	11.102044981098105
Bring Starkey.	13.943843522115227
Stephen sat down.	11.003181429761012
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	18.230966133479544
Blushing, his mask said: —Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	14.339216815746985
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: —Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	16.68197418267358
Alarmed face asks me.	4.712641562774532
Why did he come?	14.708581553515922
Courtesy or an inward light?	13.091378835554595
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	11.241578053809423
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from hue and cry.	7.514594585079273
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	14.678963581832852
Fox and geese.	9.293213176738265
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	9.188537934720756
So you think...	8.809883537912972
The door closed behind the outgoer.	14.872870310220367
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	5.932942820562371
A vestal’s lamp.	18.969139969062997
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	11.004502159811274
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	8.099353485514857
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	9.277222520959544
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	15.53776084993416
_In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks._ They are still.	6.487062444042527
Once quick in the brains of men.	15.550374254810489
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	17.41747255965802
—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	17.22527779676125
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	15.100296174933648
Not even so much.	14.747198381671001
Others abide our question.	5.737533304325978
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	10.775503515823123
—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?	7.279811362106224
Mr Best pleaded.	24.504971718447354
I mean, a kind of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life.	17.76192478973294
I mean, I don’t care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	9.20865065462554
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.	12.859043440740429
His private papers in the original.	14.231835178350938
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	6.14633179370776
Taim in mo shagart_.	8.55639188197318
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	20.15529146176144
Bear with me.	6.0469924121547685
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	3.7137386743827676
A basilisk.	16.58211792698403
_E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_.	7.952942957995838
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	12.078701395778987
—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	9.267523806655007
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	19.122515166449897
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	20.19810357057561
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	19.337743994761695
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	8.01465463221373
—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	13.981789106295999
I feel Hamlet quite young.	9.770557785626087
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	13.665892547882121
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	24.456276684030477
He is in my father.	50.20803115534246
I am in his son.	35.661204356107156
—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	19.584642668156338
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	14.270515933403953
—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	17.240665026360976
The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	7.401572066152024
—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	21.212878633443044
—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	15.435994093966427
Said that.	5.108686525151457
—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	13.774580765105663
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	9.07535111421527
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	5.504583264405476
—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	34.30599020232937
—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	11.69650074289408
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	15.001149482173494
Good Bacon: gone musty.	7.082569710069092
Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats.	18.54132629235894
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	12.948480417700898
Seekers on the great quest.	39.28349442918989
What town, good masters?	15.903402442343621
Mummed in names: A.	5.4319901964449615
E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.	15.562561407764894
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_.	13.413136402584106
Booted the twain and staved.	7.082569710069092
How many miles to Dublin?	19.028083585733487
Three score and ten, sir.	3.95407635854696
Will we be there by candlelight?	11.93585552671273
—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	17.212974778184595
—Does he?	9.121241528830698
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	11.739802505816634
—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	16.399916942335107
What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s child.	11.208059014014989
—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	26.649384848998007
_L’art d’être grand_...	3.450348599386239
—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	22.797949770871853
Do you know what you are talking about?	18.716779694388258
Word known to all men.	7.784900823805091
_Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ..._ —His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral.	9.215844901393686
Such an appeal will touch him.	5.311932219283376
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	9.84164844200588
He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.	10.25147323014878
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	11.986346630958451
—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	22.68279187843276
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	12.47262463995957
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	6.439517246972131
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	8.109249738152855
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	17.29327402045933
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	5.557803659817692
I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have been.	10.101238176264728
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize of their fray.	12.8251097682594
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	9.274609185528282
Dost love, Miriam?	21.52216892199628
Dost love thy man?	8.031415415994449
—That may be too, Stephen said.	13.521024369216637
There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr Magee likes to quote.	13.60176761746977
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	16.665799754714513
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	13.75647523547312
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	18.42832332177986
Why?	12.497976142926124
Belief in himself has been untimely killed.	12.666303188755233
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	11.189083533744729
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	6.009128610830746
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	9.331401869219397
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	9.883265758643612
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.	11.081210688454796
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	23.87964231318701
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	12.311911550472669
They list.	10.269333115996188
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	19.69203210529304
—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	19.758540956683394
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	13.508734898004436
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	11.008706390753716
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted.	19.612803605910855
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	20.236768869864825
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	15.870838874078075
His beaver is up.	5.813153198135091
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	42.75814662581822
—Amen! was responded from the doorway.	10.753749860020706
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	13.545023590522819
_Entr’acte_.	11.148858409578036
A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	14.388508134658498
My telegram.	13.943843522115227
—You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not?	15.159163533203758
he asked of Stephen.	29.504990646850025
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	12.764889830888654
They make him welcome.	14.291714802157038
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	7.499635573294081
[Illustration] He lifts his hands.	6.923667610093262
Veils fall.	9.85978631029179
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	10.717375980926782
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	9.299968091221636
A most instructive discussion.	13.642434997216885
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	23.765452962558182
All sides of life should be represented.	18.810128670447977
He smiled on all sides equally.	19.7806353290821
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: —Shakespeare?	28.581627462197325
he said.	3.724527490343976
I seem to know the name.	12.282086559917044
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	10.041903897931041
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	14.885281251030973
The chap that writes like Synge.	8.747943063179333
Mr Best turned to him.	0.9507928198975619
—Haines missed you, he said.	4.218098325880498
Did you meet him?	17.04772357123403
He’ll see you after at the D.	21.63499178166191
B.	10.122147751176978
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	13.047617420071926
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	11.533684159092806
Was he here?	16.3160124380436
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.	11.514832422235074
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	10.958201456951029
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	14.006817752393248
Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman?	27.174821796999687
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	15.878053888141825
He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.	6.5422680470182355
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	22.13498777873991
That _Portrait of Mr W.	7.0799192330483764
H._ where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	16.38579302704544
—For Willie Hughes, is it not?	14.995364399278436
the quaker librarian asked.	4.867258755875462
Or Hughie Wills?	11.148858409578036
Mr William Himself.	16.92538249648606
W.	10.582866589593744
H.: who am I?	17.990934105692656
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	16.329270165776258
Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out.	8.355338835088213
It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know.	8.04676834058246
The light touch.	7.791124599957709
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	16.250504455318254
You’re darned witty.	14.060690194177138
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.	7.471401131475938
How much did I spend?	25.797757561150032
O, a few shillings.	75.21615725299549
For a plump of pressmen.	10.42980595095267
Humour wet and dry.	11.724087229034316
Wit.	32.13581597679176
You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in.	7.061918851828416
Lineaments of gratified desire.	7.124763581548046
There be many mo.	9.645223575437983
Take her for me.	8.166247702411205
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	14.682764428817404
Yea, turtledove her.	5.059474671530799
Eve.	25.50621404370786
Naked wheatbellied sin.	7.355503433762563
A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.	12.172173062101031
—Do you think it is only a paradox?	18.76794682901385
the quaker librarian was asking.	12.114958895261045
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	8.493585568726782
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.	12.669491323236164
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	9.684696319806626
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	16.84218156967901
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	9.798952038952246
—Telegram! he said.	4.125475935103168
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: —_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus.	8.056983787357497
Where did you launch it from?	16.321493525084104
The kips?	16.58211792698403
No. College Green.	32.000721116220575
Have you drunk the four quid?	14.18016932825545
The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father.	12.996600357095973
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	9.557167475241377
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: —It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	12.855718123361566
’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching.	10.094458722258935
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	9.706264546826612
He wailed: —And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	15.577749394955015
Stephen laughed.	9.573690248878348
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	9.100349695495042
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	9.453293108736087
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	12.735008597530891
He’s out in pampooties to murder you.	8.512608031792139
—Me! Stephen exclaimed.	10.907125354941606
That was your contribution to literature.	15.430881190900013
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	27.952804929104982
—Murder you! he laughed.	14.053767698440563
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts.	5.000636405159179
In words of words for words, palabras.	19.550877992977064
Oisin with Patrick.	8.080465848484218
Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.	7.032796652990458
_C’est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish.	9.314496096029439
His image, wandering, he met.	19.4911155194429
I mine.	9.105249025485831
I met a fool i’the forest.	14.759452429684071
—...	2.4299861334617914
in which everyone can find his own.	14.143391616140466
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	5.32006309965492
Yes?	18.7931391896167
What is it?	5.933985884478757
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	17.062755975041583
From the _Freeman._ He wants to see the files of the _Kilkenny People_ for last year.	24.356733699266428
—Certainly, certainly, certainly.	12.451508889876811
Is the gentleman?...	6.822526454214586
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	21.11931054800667
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	8.220664600514022
—This gentleman?	16.685680356865603
_Freeman’s Journal?	31.145525565319513
Kilkenny People?_ To be sure.	12.713756635500138
Good day, sir.	4.7923021605300296
_Kilkenny_...	2.8418718209786236
We have certainly...	6.857560832026601
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	6.201703594553017
—All the leading provincial...	4.993722459043696
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903...	4.314098626115477
Will you please?...	6.56614776589028
Evans, conduct this gentleman...	3.4739564769451525
If you just follow the atten...	6.532927443772745
Or, please allow me...	7.655419975575738
This way...	7.285433748505846
Please, sir...	4.635220294154047
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.	11.599407446560127
The door closed.	14.609204511398977
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	8.543286654281143
He jumped up and snatched the card.	14.113877482759303
—What’s his name?	9.70457263927713
Ikey Moses?	16.58211792698403
Bloom.	7.724644464000979
He rattled on: —Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	7.546204219798329
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	17.792329506659556
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	7.852589856578925
Every day we must do homage to her.	6.8046241157144784
_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._ Suddenly he turned to Stephen: —He knows you.	11.390894395591953
He knows your old fellow.	6.3833135121847535
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	28.721058195251413
Venus Kallipyge.	16.58211792698403
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	13.34569013617778
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.	25.699990633338555
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	13.426432009661756
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	28.558248106268344
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	6.915334755772367
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	27.817822318334272
His life was rich.	14.596221200904703
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	12.22476667820421
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	4.901494310527963
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	15.256693637709558
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	8.42056580305709
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	5.6263936549807205
You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	15.139350123374484
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	13.202073724054372
Cours la Reine.	11.148858409578036
_Encore vingt sous.	11.148858409578036
Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.	7.082569710069092
Tu veux?_ —The height of fine society.	16.047650263225208
And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	14.419616535344689
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: —Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! —And Harry of six wives’ daughter.	11.331589807473414
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	4.76222091609967
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	9.180023402714315
Do and do.	11.639396513229643
Thing done.	9.324810169522841
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	9.675629560107243
An azured harebell like her veins.	8.014858122881158
Lids of Juno’s eyes, violets.	18.82209553636857
He walks.	23.60097507926347
One life is all.	6.600428193296181
One body.	8.166900031109893
Do. But do.	4.590605632699197
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	10.986301982190852
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.	16.788608755954435
—Whom do you suspect?	13.834955536721495
he challenged.	16.58211792698403
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	19.1207928876669
Once spurned twice spurned.	8.55639188197318
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	24.964150880841654
Love that dare not speak its name.	3.93679698064844
—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a lord.	20.282488992865858
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	5.636211105707435
At Charenton I watched them.	5.002136280182704
—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	17.61716784851389
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	11.232914867605762
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	15.445678798126476
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother.	8.571022042499399
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	30.452883516257238
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	11.113164914873977
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	13.82401825151658
—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	22.60341312643242
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	15.055695565285388
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	13.69349113070755
O, yes, mention there is.	10.357799258731793
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd.	16.027860502873036
Explain you then.	9.001824794770904
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	9.074610557308008
He faced their silence.	8.254942967334086
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	10.525473824452927
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.	25.2830255152196
She was entitled to her widow’s dower At common law.	13.349278287620317
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	4.377192058752264
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	13.968251732231744
And therefore when he was urged, As I believe, to name her He left her his Secondbest Bed.	12.117040666965663
Woa! —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	9.182055808361056
—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	19.380182666278003
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	16.915884104296847
—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	17.77516976011535
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	7.4383698535525244
—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	5.272538828016365
Let me think.	23.71469681427496
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	9.153594696541665
—Do you mean he died so?	11.177883945084464
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	14.001170744848793
I mean...	7.040797657076756
—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	24.288169719271135
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	17.84648774758862
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! —What?	15.898723427922727
asked Besteglinton.	16.58211792698403
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	14.468451840322473
The people’s William.	22.19258134133916
For terms apply: E.	4.400013369816469
Dowden, Highfield house...	4.515964438662702
—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	13.40901150574681
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	21.638100033668657
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those days._ Lovely! Catamite.	10.793309421627335
—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	10.782751908567493
Steadfast John replied severe: —The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	7.693763336578178
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	5.198842822720162
Sayest thou so?	6.403337657588574
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	22.00737607000236
—And the sense of property, Stephen said.	6.747339223622187
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	11.474694396108664
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	4.417759658018553
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	8.75450017364387
All events brought grist to his mill.	11.869850266618704
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	13.261791318410177
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love’s Labour Lost_.	9.92059139929447
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	11.245771041953299
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory of equivocation.	14.482568114307346
The _Sea Venture_ comes home from Bermudas and the play Renan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.	7.874366652934849
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s.	4.313585853602795
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	7.987427478515953
I think you’re getting on very nicely.	11.838021822224357
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	10.979456610690272
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._ —Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	7.574156002400336
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	12.622751639005719
_Sufflaminandus sum._ —He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals.	17.081709774495234
—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	21.482157552874952
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	15.165755657446551
_Amplius.	25.50621404370786
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos._ —Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	4.236695129276699
—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	5.372357687365693
There he keened a wailing rune.	10.359134058223285
—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	11.628058620165802
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	7.825893236273374
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	11.247532368743371
Accusations are made in anger.	13.027994730610777
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	10.08767355705987
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	6.3410989273879315
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	7.509115146358226
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	7.51166358058497
—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	12.031175326123527
—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.	4.203118768519532
—Which will?	18.329227630491133
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	12.363458212114134
We are getting mixed.	20.481310917494824
_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.	26.741571308158857
What of all the will to do?	22.895328437299955
It has vanished long ago...	5.436800083382991
—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.	17.362433230771934
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul.	11.04868473559803
She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_.	5.144006769539259
Venus has twisted her lips in prayer.	8.232444042696338
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	6.725020464011053
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	16.744384742657807
—History shows that to be true, _inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos_.	13.671942580892669
The ages succeed one another.	5.649766584380445
But we have it on high authority that a man’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	21.624522980329346
I feel that Russell is right.	7.218633532150343
What do we care for his wife or father?	17.307731978469533
I should say that only family poets have family lives.	7.882061033439915
Falstaff was not a family man.	12.079151477748127
I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.	19.050095910414374
Lean, he lay back.	14.331761208434294
Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid.	11.166989518925782
Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup.	12.89290386156041
A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him.	3.420272124210017
Visits him here on quarter days.	6.1390310866736435
Mr Magee, sir, there’s a gentleman to see you.	12.961236617324003
Me?	17.685021073205338
Says he’s your father, sir.	15.565361589236488
Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.	8.148136114972791
Your own?	19.8459753406449
He knows your old fellow.	6.3833135121847535
The widower.	13.943843522115227
Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand.	7.369204070214806
The voice, new warmth, speaking.	15.550151469515072
Dr Bob Kenny is attending her.	3.474018258723326
The eyes that wish me well.	7.9001135674540786
But do not know me.	9.799501915826728
—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil.	12.160285284236812
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.	16.835655108097217
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen.	12.348004276131883
No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night.	9.166626629800643
From hour to hour it rots and rots.	7.441903981169187
He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.	5.857426156869094
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child.	20.267233952562375
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man.	9.56814594017544
On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.	10.853122902413478
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.	11.56787964293341
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life.	6.35525363276206
Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?	18.332551131781916
What the hell are you driving at?	13.859259796823297
Shut up.	5.510443277684281
Blast you.	7.222769134425272
I have reasons.	34.79187127564518
_Amplius.	25.50621404370786

—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach.	9.905814438436872
Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.	4.17001644554645
The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care.	7.896101757948738
He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.	18.014920574546043
In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.	4.446689746292406
—What links them in nature?	27.2163120221433
An instant of blind rut.	10.99112731917264
Am I a father?	19.995443118326627

Shrunken uncertain hand.	4.868131376775024
—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son.	12.876410514791386

Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son?	21.150604159781402
When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.	20.451307025650625
Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.	14.988603430256862
Gladly glancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.	16.38738463196758
Flatter.	32.13581597679176
Rarely.	32.13581597679176
But flatter.	16.58211792698403
—Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself.	6.612855828383557
I am big with child.	15.190559356780096
I have an unborn child in my brain.	15.07292189310667
Pallas Athena! A play! The play’s the thing! Let me parturiate! He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.	12.195241917316832
—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest of Arden.	26.109997121173983
Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in _Coriolanus._ His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in _King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare.	15.307348328246807
Who the girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter’s Tale_ are we know.	9.939636617219053
Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess.	9.637254140816653
But there is another member of his family who is recorded.	22.731932886780594
—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.	5.331271679598349
The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.	8.671115301641082
Door closed.	11.725328032605423
Cell.	32.13581597679176
Day.	25.50621404370786
They list.	10.269333115996188

They.	25.50621404370786
I you he they.	10.82639741088797
Come, mess.	23.800675310486728
STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard.	20.93895758247524
Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back.	9.23671786763905
The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul.	7.358638407968051
He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.	14.546236046254105
MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?	7.8954705874852165
BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know.	10.67596782957415
I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.	13.865391387501315
_(Laughter)_ BUCKMULLIGAN: (_Piano, diminuendo_) Then outspoke medical Dick To his comrade medical Davy...	5.931345898859768
STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’ names.	8.721063964332314
Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.	10.305816969340121
BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it.	11.163032195293024
I don’t want Richard, my name ...	10.006094987714611
STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.	32.375678679789246
He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus.	13.92415484544509
Like John o’Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country.	6.98023252864914
What’s in a name?	12.023262236521434
That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours.	14.141656853326483
A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.	26.626712347037973
It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars.	15.3255731847807
His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.	13.61395591535293
Both satisfied.	13.943843522115227
I too.	5.195344620294908
Wait to be wooed and won.	19.383635202164058
Who will woo you?	5.5516683846255965
Read the skies.	25.694879433238647

D._ —What is that, Mr Dedalus?	171.38910626168325
the quaker librarian asked.	4.867258755875462
Was it a celestial phenomenon?	15.7504225479098
—A star by night, Stephen said.	12.313610497767936
A pillar of the cloud by day.	7.205120395954487
What more’s to speak?	31.017284975723964
Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.	31.735657326339968
_Stephanos,_ my crown.	10.628441914226821
My sword.	16.58211792698403
His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet.	8.884597174139024
Buy a pair.	32.451677561488125
Holes in my socks.	17.818248800605083
Handkerchief too.	5.167893237494866
—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.	18.166316171026775
Your own name is strange enough.	12.034092000715948
I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.	8.240694546796938
Me, Magee and Mulligan.	8.207575835581945
Fabulous artificer.	16.58211792698403
You flew.	10.595029903244942
Whereto?	32.13581597679176
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger.	6.14633179370776
Lapwing.	22.281730317965827
Icarus.	32.13581597679176
_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering.	8.519510511384869
Lapwing you are.	6.8363877872455605
Lapwing be.	7.6565712655234135
Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say: —That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths.	15.744082753396167
Just what you say.	8.196781437850733
The three brothers Shakespeare.	10.475680930706165
In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales.	16.53629050738286
The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.	8.69821197986479
Best of Best brothers.	8.592917319534681
Good, better, best.	23.50361689768701
The quaker librarian springhalted near.	9.702689554594858
—I should like to know, he said, which brother you...	10.854633718969348
I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers...	12.133874214549177
But perhaps I am anticipating?	20.67396698449509
An attendant from the doorway called: —Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...	7.304033500345126
—O, Father Dineen! Directly.	17.562952064920186
Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.	6.69914344751995
John Eglinton touched the foil.	17.812546845331077
—Come, he said.	4.307151187257632
Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.	26.403655316052557
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?	12.248247551747133
—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.	12.430568268593158
A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.	11.028200514412655
Lapwing.	22.281730317965827
Where is your brother?	26.68351188345332
Apothecaries’ hall.	7.214771153110151
My whetstone.	16.58211792698403
Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these.	18.244527170935324
Speech, speech.	14.21347644648392
Act speech.	11.089130599646298
They mock to try you.	6.175714535145727
Act.	32.13581597679176
Be acted on.	4.3922378907479045
Lapwing.	22.281730317965827
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.	32.450374905711286
My kingdom for a drink.	8.880461299528433
On. —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays.	21.548026359813893
Why did he take them rather than others?	17.005726647544147
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	12.217619030570898
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	9.108201281245638
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	9.006830953581233
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world.	13.20732009062981
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	12.68143316954989
—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.	29.034902715923952
We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.	8.281272628524302
_Que voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.	4.959803982130411
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	9.512250731822352
—Why?	13.619971502880057
Stephen answered himself.	11.623282132132868
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	21.78559164699116
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	6.266295467419791
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	10.92157229074425
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	15.56240121258393
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	13.776269878225524
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	13.465711588114214
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	8.742829000487141
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	20.702032957185196
Age has not withered it.	5.194796958009364
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	11.426893740419901
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.	13.827850924810551
He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.	25.958806233311474
Judge Eglinton summed up.	4.10508062872513
—The truth is midway, he affirmed.	15.499847575957928
He is the ghost and the prince.	53.53395133165477
He is all in all.	19.73612202108833
—He is, Stephen said.	8.441228977138216
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	17.570807058863398
All in all.	10.080175863479909
He acts and is acted on.	4.817817657156479
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	8.483812709045583
—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	6.061046263445814
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	7.437403200864609
—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	9.85223112152106
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.	12.670110347194628
After God Shakespeare has created most.	8.728704322625479
—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	3.424809939429422
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	15.144416702189766
Then dies.	12.599684944605478
The motion is ended.	7.622878559556313
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	12.286420954297352
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	18.055596776405597
Strong curtain.	12.599684944605478
He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	14.308073662651534
Maeterlinck says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep.	9.74299778682285
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day.	5.207864038450166
We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.	8.09773122619816
The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	13.07462549023208
_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried.	14.952740613282389
_Eureka!_ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk.	14.732818442379173
—May I?	10.576667166067956
he said.	3.724527490343976
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	8.004257155785652
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	9.308927959349736
Take some slips from the counter going out.	10.74240002546476
—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	20.245747808160225
The rest shall keep as they are.	5.8905551357255455
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	11.905028821795419
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._ —You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	8.057111307837747
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	30.193091979387322
Do you believe your own theory?	27.494931859626078
—No, Stephen said promptly.	15.540506872732792
—Are you going to write it?	7.938221583274902
Mr Best asked.	11.486648410319587
You ought to make it a dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	9.704838962795991
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	6.186442684388578
—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment for it since you don’t believe it yourself.	15.281384009480247
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	5.748024349632933
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	13.01629845160572
He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays.	8.018128254125562
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	29.086268203257173
But he believes his theory.	17.62706721540481
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	14.135419239565303
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	24.98573606661907
Who helps to believe?	14.752059185197528
_Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?	11.171644065077095
—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	10.401981608123945
Then I don’t know about the next number.	20.123476508611454
Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.	9.445818685156233
Fraidrine.	32.13581597679176
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	6.290122358855593
Tide you over.	5.685266147648296
—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	13.235970578995948
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: —I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	14.95511246522986
He broke away.	8.90233268227189
—Come, Kinch.	11.381191463294934
Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.	18.80598005628289
You have eaten all we left.	8.256603670866113
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	11.748714057088534
Stephen rose.	8.909322665144582
Life is many days.	7.820129340346129
This will end.	6.576650952291391
—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	7.567910673295593
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	6.663204834418521
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	12.462407923416032
—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	7.0047456338288185
I’ll be there.	6.975660702435405
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	11.880306296543658
Can you walk straight?	20.317979666735436
Laughing, he...	8.95487915282065
Swill till eleven.	7.355503433762563
Irish nights entertainment.	11.148858409578036
Lubber...	2.8418718209786236
Stephen followed a lubber...	2.9204743613487176
One day in the national library we had a discussion.	13.414976343983703
After.	32.13581597679176
His lub back: I followed.	13.452108320943884
I gall his kibe.	8.55639188197318
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	12.049175856827198
What have I learned?	16.63547176525246
Of them?	9.573690248878348
Of me?	7.274431494472446
Walk like Haines now.	3.9649444280784425

—O please do, sir...	8.478592470934766
I shall be most pleased...	6.196531144985968
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: —A pleased bottom.	9.51942639299285
The turnstile.	16.58211792698403
Is that?...	8.633804104625025
Idly writing...	4.686288972527201
Looked?...	2.340437969140056
The curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.	6.14633179370776
He spluttered to the air: —O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton.	13.63937374571928
We went over to their playbox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall.	16.374971450625853

Abbey Theatre! I smell the pubic sweat of monks.	8.091835625092921
He spat blank.	11.148858409578036
Forgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him.	7.967687248720753
And left the _femme de trente ans._ And why no other children born?	10.051685781338707

The dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling, minion of pleasure, Phedo’s toyable fair hair.	10.841808653304033

—Longworth and M’Curdy Atkinson were there...	5.434719238055311
Puck Mulligan footed featly, trilling: I hardly hear the purlieu cry Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by Before my thoughts begin to run On F.	7.1019116975982985
M’Curdy Atkinson, The same that had the wooden leg And that filibustering filibeg That never dared to slake his drouth, Magee that had the chinless mouth.	7.659502429660152
Being afraid to marry on earth They masturbated for all they were worth.	13.081848419708141
Jest on.	5.909382163877581
Know thyself.	16.58211792698403
Halted, below me, a quizzer looks at me.	10.706779410942882
I halt.	16.58211792698403
—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	11.478446689569802
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	4.816546390924187
A laugh tripped over his lips.	5.996542523914421
—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	15.683684332956032
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	12.537269299433243
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?	19.78162810754733
One thinks of Homer.	17.00527125991538
He stopped at the stairfoot.	19.477594424683886
—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.	16.785384613884244
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	7.602428839115537
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan._ He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying: —The disguise, I fear, is thin.	10.113176397765121
He read, _marcato:_ —Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK ) and ) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY ) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	6.074242910645014
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	11.803045890041414
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	21.3600282267376
Part.	32.13581597679176
The moment is now.	5.084270960958657
Where then?	9.573690248878348
If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	7.630813156546642
Why?	12.497976142926124
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	18.279294331049602
My will: his will that fronts me.	6.67154457556725
Seas between.	12.599684944605478
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	26.53780849678813
—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	6.633595921006682
The portico.	16.58211792698403
Here I watched the birds for augury.	15.676449646740316
Ængus of the birds.	20.28112985720155
They go, they come.	20.88663134627219
Last night I flew.	9.43087878325955
Easily flew.	10.595029903244942

Street of harlots after.	6.771626913601677
A creamfruit melon he held to me.	7.334403394065468
In. You will see.	12.769230911530986
—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe.	17.859961138524458
Did you see his eye?	30.492354394534107
He looked upon you to lust after you.	10.50969010416896
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	15.739147740358387
O, Kinch, thou art in peril.	23.437066746416235
Get thee a breechpad.	8.55639188197318

Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.	5.272237548481464
A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	15.79966842816458
Offend me still.	8.72241508875831
Speak on.	5.909382163877581
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	4.645967448258538
No birds.	11.089130599646298
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	9.1643152396823
Cease to strive.	11.148858409578036
Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic: from wide earth an altar.	6.432484747942841
Laud we the gods And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils From our bless’d altars.	6.506164568382915
[ 10 ] The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	5.004460680050055
reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps.	15.843611058463141
Five to three.	7.267251516589922
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	12.75471430779816
What was that boy’s name again?	16.80048246306885
Dignam.	14.44968689830552
Yes.	9.732442163148734
_Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the person to see.	6.620539776082546
Mr Cunningham’s letter.	11.866399072311852
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Oblige him, if possible.	30.896128001853448
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	3.281549162955734
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	6.784688649255329
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	8.585701797750437
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	20.692675149109043
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square.	13.652910434757395
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. —Very well, indeed, father.	14.606196026415512
And you, father?	39.75760659803029
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	21.47040521192832
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	13.539743505022754
Was that so?	12.362930859795327
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	8.329500504451678
And Mr Sheehy himself?	8.279211252996461
Still in London.	8.44049263585791
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	12.053787072945124
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	12.982495215585882
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	16.11236932858014
O, yes: a very great success.	24.458806417838396
A wonderful man really.	5.737533304325978
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.	13.447273731925057
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	16.261714928628383
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	23.479004940069395
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.	16.07431428890836
—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?	7.185299894229119
A zealous man, however.	15.519223172407855
Really he was.	9.883112564176734
And really did great good in his way.	9.574942329966929
Beyond a doubt.	8.114342028423653
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	16.03858865892155
Of good family too would one think it?	5.349162101066323
Welsh, were they not?	12.886228963500976
O, lest he forget.	21.47845614827081
That letter to father provincial.	8.118262218537508
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square.	9.288057172133804
Yes: they were from Belvedere.	24.73849659992226
The little house.	11.295308861111213
Aha.	22.281730317965827
And were they good boys at school?	12.781366774517776
That was very good now.	25.90609199509948
And what was his name?	10.549023125028762
Jack Sohan.	16.58211792698403
And his name?	13.268154153144062
Ger.	32.13581597679176
Gallaher.	32.13581597679176
And the other little man?	27.434246518278275
His name was Brunny Lynam.	22.232262377355124
O, that was a very nice name to have.	18.704295415109197
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	15.039714576042174
—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.	12.682902020222254
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: —O, sir.	8.639861825681281
—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	13.019874644014175
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	18.061516904365483
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	13.584779617617912
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.	9.247749510985942
Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?	13.76067153113777
Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	9.988698635825008
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	16.123056930186625
How did she do?	15.066872294772304
A fine carriage she had.	10.895471215305129
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	9.919182141177286
And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a...	11.404327714384486
what should he say?...	3.750995504064751
such a queenly mien.	18.368000948484667
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	13.433043134898224
The reverend T.	13.146914996573832
R.	13.667053076115803
Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak.	18.490061173909858
The incumbent they called him.	4.976554513230618
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	20.105553856875634
But one should be charitable.	23.44728794841903
Invincible ignorance.	16.58211792698403
They acted according to their lights.	14.33233564204837
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	15.788095855687365
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	16.266757308307415
Surely, there ought to be.	10.657848381448144
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	4.171045109040365
All raised untidy caps.	9.645223575437983
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	12.876743421301539
Christian brother boys.	8.080465848484218
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	14.237271879542934
For aged and virtuous females.	7.848394559256099
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	25.805927028200497
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	15.08502427731908
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	8.78800895114966
And now it was an office or something.	15.091754266239045
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	20.219223178659746
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	5.698580318638867
He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	8.418607270642232
In America those things were continually happening.	7.602428839115537
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	14.881204454379871
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	25.435438982255874
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	17.546829818786062
They saluted him and were saluted.	14.693380414915465
Father Conmee passed H.	13.118825195841364
O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	11.998726603932793
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	10.9438983619358
In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	15.496192565641397
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	8.32741937428174
It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.	16.98865955245101
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	4.237092174380314
of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	15.717365925320685
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C.	5.954274276179329
of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	21.613376155857647
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	8.73485393268222
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	15.72862868370935
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	6.950512080250646
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	17.32252785029034
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	15.988686500015795
It was a peaceful day.	15.794934573291851
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	32.8072330947439
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	18.87045393856904
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	6.379102612178714
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	25.126132259225198
He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.	15.189704067059909
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	21.049152321353628
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	16.899123443295956
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	6.3331657605297655
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	13.648032161263561
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	8.253037593677455
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	9.51189351073229
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	15.664300997682998
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	8.573305149478372
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.	14.54496456461251
But they were God’s souls, created by God.	17.135131830838095
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	13.492648712803438
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	16.65459556062196
The Malahide road was quiet.	6.4148509902083335
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	7.40967931168947
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	5.20433708909721
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	5.774260482497159
Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.	14.33752456897344
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	11.640888020759181
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	15.016745974914087
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	9.107060186574461
Who could know the truth?	21.635458875019076
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother?	7.873888803194293
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	10.023271485309065
Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.	17.985561727037187
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	12.817621210739395
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	12.89468744167807
He was humane and honoured there.	6.502184925777874
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters.	6.578379607833207
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	13.643711942950048
It was a charming day.	17.39519718067432
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	8.368616468429375
_Moutonner,_ the French said.	7.586969976758504
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	10.604139504847126
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	7.694928696739782
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	26.464034489890125
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	11.80230700430195
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	10.404283996887907
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	14.745437061152778
Nones.	32.13581597679176
He should have read that before lunch.	16.4142899552606
But lady Maxwell had come.	6.414908858093863
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	8.466030369998698
_Deus in adiutorium._ He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._ A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	8.889550609516835
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	8.820980358819876
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	16.73003101440478
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum._ * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	7.0750838128874705
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	13.005071589229212
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	9.577410564439203
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	11.740255604051816
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.	8.791219894964367
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	10.037354749779244
Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	9.55508463207353
—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	17.55389872261931
—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	5.414278861102352
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	8.686365492192415
—What’s the best news?	9.483821459605483
—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	14.044178497863816
* * * A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.	9.621545592095373
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: —_home and beauty._ J.	5.640816013512932
O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	18.08893223206957
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	8.227259514140966
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	9.08954335710303
He halted and growled angrily: —_For England_...	6.191141426882621
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	10.821949963408622
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply: —_home and beauty._ The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.	9.675285487243665
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	15.77566955608292
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.	8.988509105053716
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	11.6138548497921
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	13.20651256930952
It fell on the path.	12.413929365753418
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying: —There, sir.	15.826582641206578
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	11.653153256718355
—Did you put in the books?	38.45296036963096
Boody asked.	5.408245575147789
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	7.912618948908974
—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.	3.5108527543349886
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	13.406921824829725
—Where did you try?	28.20830351644835
Boody asked.	5.408245575147789
—M’Guinness’s.	7.697653835894492
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	9.603708241886297
—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	7.492122937229093
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	9.757873963594093
—What’s in the pot?	28.703737267867478
she asked.	10.405771347419485
—Shirts, Maggy said.	2.4295480751691634
Boody cried angrily: —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	16.599996499238063
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: —And what’s in this?	16.501451413819552
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	6.087400850131511
—Peasoup, Maggy said.	2.4295480751691634
—Where did you get it?	12.4828697863272
Katey asked.	6.175031302735487
—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	3.020263065228293
The lacquey rang his bell.	8.044923865285222
—Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: —Give us it here.	9.189052593723998
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	15.125811346624513
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: —A good job we have that much.	15.452232354139968
Where’s Dilly?	33.98067690049503
—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	5.353974646053112
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: —Our father who art not in heaven.	14.218792914832822
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed: —Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.	8.533823410126217
* * * The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	9.484127874624042
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	16.212395749302534
—Put these in first, will you?	6.9745971654208985
he said.	3.724527490343976
—Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	7.207719717001125
—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	7.626068818892233
She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.	10.260699435290313
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	8.625669249465446
H.	11.300041881167411
E.	10.582866589593744
L.	10.990294469428525
Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	7.998828608166919
He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain’s length.	17.86277100373514
—Can you send them by tram?	17.369767333529968
Now?	25.50621404370786
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	6.7244665199690115
—Certainly, sir.	4.085666375298969
Is it in the city?	42.520756622567966
—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	8.143280464285214
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	13.148419573238801
—Will you write the address, sir?	14.16785170938207
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	8.494023482983994
—Send it at once, will you?	9.675470644397615
he said.	3.724527490343976
It’s for an invalid.	27.00121353973907
—Yes, sir.	3.411884148314826
I will, sir.	7.136707464733013
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.	11.389790341851379
—What’s the damage?	18.18473647139193
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	24.89450618085565
A young pullet.	16.92538249648606
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	21.859485883376117
—This for me?	10.30713850230606
he asked gallantly.	26.709855241378172
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	12.8586875183108
—Yes, sir, she said.	0.5442083186967932
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	5.097702985843755
Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.	14.743088176579139
—May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	15.253915799137804
he asked roguishly.	26.709855241378172
* * * _—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.	8.192421131014317
He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.	13.580825487451529
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	7.186733434023602
Men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	9.840823735981001
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	12.325712264177767
—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero giovine come Lei.	5.044305072170936
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	4.96635755534808
È peccato.	16.58211792698403
Perchè la sua voce...	2.615771504720943
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	5.504583264405476
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._ —_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.	9.308010125918683
_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	11.555694756999241
_Ma, dia retta a me.	3.929581562447337
Ci rifletta_.	16.58211792698403
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	10.14266893757127
—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	8.57055230983873
—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	4.192785633794438
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly.	14.746393756660114
Human eyes.	6.061679814198452
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	7.015138086795898
_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	15.14342335571631
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	6.14633179370776
Addio, caro._ —_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	11.89153906646154
_E grazie._ —_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	4.588306497350558
_Scusi, eh?	5.61328856285742
Tante belle cose!_ Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram.	9.309382222396188
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	8.0144730869049
Too much mystery business in it.	5.400331998022169
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	24.254293285350634
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	9.06243510986927
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: —16 June 1904.	16.920255805921524
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	10.300545618211117
E.	10.582866589593744
L.	10.990294469428525
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.	11.353373494904972
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	9.582179665586384
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	12.786479046807157
She’s not nicelooking, is she?	18.268794276887615
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.	26.76505153721115
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	14.408109389506672
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s.	8.326435677901804
They kick out grand.	7.124763581548046
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	9.023972560622692
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.	8.363056387568339
The telephone rang rudely by her ear.	10.28955845008351
—Hello.	26.338194229384666
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
No, sir.	6.945860026631445
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
I’ll ring them up after five.	7.2425761935532025
Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool.	20.084713374208192
All right, sir.	5.523773063391018
Then I can go after six if you’re not back.	10.310412705666266
A quarter after.	8.294837004818467
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
Twentyseven and six.	7.083426941097553
I’ll tell him.	5.9861272897026625
Yes: one, seven, six.	21.687999807195528
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	7.0307229754716705
—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	7.940540854195802
Mr Lenehan, yes.	13.208669326105328
He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four.	12.487647363426984
No, sir.	6.945860026631445
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
I’ll ring them up after five.	7.2425761935532025
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	18.32603196663378
—Who’s that?	10.453916015802024
Ned Lambert asked.	6.973779479054919
Is that Crotty?	26.51357540852321
—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	11.260074950907768
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	9.346377619308877
Come on.	8.994870683542715
Mind your steps there.	5.204789004610139
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	17.724033409574112
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	5.524859151269416
—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	16.388264515724572
—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	7.199750746646602
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534.	11.181151212479964
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	12.70020406295946
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.	9.810210520238009
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	11.347524487350556
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	16.565534453392416
—No, Ned.	12.10278158306488
—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	12.306960411245209
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.	14.472113652135016
—That’s right, Ned Lambert said.	7.19749348487366
That’s quite right, sir.	12.593405671735761
—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	19.70120420071675
—Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	3.558720773856921
Bring the camera whenever you like.	6.7934486165463435
I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	17.101607919798223
You can take it from here or from here.	18.475041524684976
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	9.297414480456252
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	14.187858993887142
—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	14.668462759464639
I won’t trespass on your valuable time...	8.443112628804982
—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said.	5.691100401319952
Drop in whenever you like.	8.74555328039667
Next week, say.	6.490870947815051
Can you see?	12.623227623625777
—Yes, yes.	6.291187287288263
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	20.159146985833864
Very pleased to have met you.	14.42755831162419
—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	7.48614583709989
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	14.530639419209502
With J.	5.52737264232801
O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford.	7.976766467435874
He stood to read the card in his hand.	23.410751347934998
—The reverend Hugh C.	7.388253119008869
Love, Rathcoffey.	15.956519438506938
Present address: Saint Michael’s, Sallins.	10.730030211051167
Nice young chap he is.	4.71712152993086
He’s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	11.861851620816905
He’s well up in history, faith.	20.261693702072545
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	5.377026647518331
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	13.76933914194057
O’Molloy said.	5.627656876585404
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	13.379912496160667
—God! he cried.	9.779708652989314
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	19.941671319987318
You know that one?	40.122202110491735
_I’m bloody sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.	14.964427893121854
God, I’ll tell him anyhow.	11.187302427295906
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	28.358046116235734
Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.	17.03837732158111
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	6.953316451420113
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: —Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	7.538046848957277
O’Molloy and asked: —Well, Jack.	15.321649113076923
What is it?	5.933985884478757
What’s the trouble?	23.810730748625296
Wait awhile.	10.57128783045369
Hold hard.	14.433750202917158
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	12.121216286424293
—Chow! he said.	3.745954805906867
Blast you! —The dust from those sacks, J.	10.153541515256366
O’Molloy said politely.	14.176500849576769
—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	8.593301501779639
cold night before...	5.8105102574274525
blast your soul...	4.072311525394777
night before last...	6.443149786510287
and there was a hell of a lot of draught...	8.57147897619464
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	15.579582755377338
—I was...	8.132066756786681
Glasnevin this morning...	5.437995000822197
poor little...	6.67228669302109
what do you call him...	5.759388566811308
Chow!...	3.0428060630225717
Mother of Moses! * * * Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.	10.226621587851845
—See?	11.188360003613127
he said.	3.724527490343976
Say it’s turn six.	16.692012951563523
In here, see.	16.074521511308234
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	7.734885007649156
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	7.939146586303796
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	7.298224011497151
—See?	11.188360003613127
he said.	3.724527490343976
The impact.	16.58211792698403
Leverage, see?	6.7498846136576605
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	7.72545098333378
—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	9.139268036752485
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	12.058061368394698
—See?	11.188360003613127
Tom Rochford said.	6.9951383949591435
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	9.643643522550184
Turn Now On. —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	13.948479804136593
One good turn deserves another.	5.8853470296891075
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.	16.49060438648298
—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly.	6.909189965876969
When you two begin...	5.389531761483654
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	8.72532489490943
—But how does it work here, Tommy?	21.052581916624536
See you later.	14.786396833216765
He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.	10.872312860668947
—He’s a hero, he said simply.	13.23446662582099
—I know, M’Coy said.	4.303479783582149
The drain, you mean.	9.689973086668932
—Drain?	16.58211792698403
Lenehan said.	3.2702010184325823
It was down a manhole.	38.58708389104246
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	8.245157335148933
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was.	8.927828835327679
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	18.033782204626103
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him.	12.381512132723433
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	14.804266634148432
—The act of a hero, he said.	10.09839154192574
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	5.4735926870546745
—This way, he said, walking to the right.	17.898279813885104
I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price.	20.57125192758664
What’s the time by your gold watch and chain?	19.50020911342022
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock.	10.801492859508423
—After three, he said.	6.401015143956962
Who’s riding her?	18.30370481910174
—O.	34.580601208025854
Madden, Lenehan said.	4.479630517741698
And a game filly she is.	6.790408000703685
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	13.360284651789064
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	7.876655795101345
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	22.92611852996191
—Even money, Lenehan said returning.	10.964198779248003
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly.	13.50360683632445
Through here.	5.839984039894037
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch.	16.302006880271257
A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	8.669521732928944
—There he is, Lenehan said.	5.273424872103158
—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.	13.795276190202701
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.	12.692103470636258
—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said.	4.490286510097092
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	27.624720486760573
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	14.808665913391817
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.	6.863384816875898
Come over in the sun.	11.37280220297246
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	17.78124993645985
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	11.318648220048486
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	11.850951442926142
The annual dinner, you know.	5.541703068093722
Boiled shirt affair.	8.949652011548354
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	15.497602868785815
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	5.207400992888866
—I know, M’Coy broke in.	8.433129066464254
My missus sang there once.	7.55792229564705
—Did she?	14.626065833722794
Lenehan said.	3.2702010184325823
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.	6.51830133890435
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	9.775138681495767
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	4.376092636661508
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	6.426674696761767
Bloom and the wife were there.	15.854656634649702
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	7.799524473845049
Fast and furious it was.	8.94222651378969
After liquids came solids.	8.55639188197318
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	2.5444753268311135
—I know, M’Coy said.	4.303479783582149
The year the missus was there...	6.697249049947253
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	12.255070252966435
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	4.376092636661508
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before.	16.844677127333707
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	19.168784065021338
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	23.08547275839089
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	7.422087363852323
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband.	17.43806800261222
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	9.270067960782178
Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	14.649241817848763
Like that.	5.4945867608175005
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	10.994629190361593
Know what I mean?	10.797027208721033
His hands moulded ample curves of air.	7.957316905298357
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	13.913246395701336
—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	14.012110619784647
She’s a gamey mare and no mistake.	12.674441034889155
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	20.860002731472406
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	15.145835903193815
He knows them all, faith.	13.32736253124711
At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away.	4.920352235768857
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	2.4805814210287105
_That one, is it?_ says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._ By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.	17.889019693763142
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	9.768296183865202
—I’m weak, he gasped.	25.09477644913506
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	10.011328211109142
Lenehan walked on again.	7.009008609037043
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	6.611088323070501
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.	16.132122265371297
He’s not one of your common or garden...	9.119745451740743
you know...	7.778799062649657
There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	15.603953190051836
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.	10.437624815197832
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	5.801953700002198
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	12.720067841306989
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	7.643925384848993
Child born every minute somewhere.	7.271881480328411
Mrs Purefoy.	9.884235987460922
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	11.162325812155188
—That I had, he said, pushing it by.	21.586932612336636
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	7.301972063106755
—Them are two good ones, he said.	4.102790455118798
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	18.921649872465935
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	11.762953534809862
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.	6.0963220489131364
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	28.22920773712593
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	9.423032829323882
Know the kind that is.	7.661930846494952
Had it?	5.692550280399153
Yes.	9.732442163148734
He opened it.	4.481780497141782
Thought so.	6.705815021411638
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain.	13.963965355131924
Listen: the man.	20.266997784780592
No: she wouldn’t like that much.	15.899464877341448
Got her it once.	8.247216213999042
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	14.774514263724473
More in her line.	16.145397128287556
Let us see.	10.400861341912709
He read where his finger opened.	17.70346543598052
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies.	11.216989703315507
For him! For Raoul!_ Yes.	11.237436406932362
This.	22.281730317965827
Try.	32.13581597679176
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._ Yes.	10.260856221765879
Take this.	8.425917152462297
The end.	14.445850153738848
—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	19.69035714487665
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	6.814495635262271
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.	3.7953898374171526
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._ Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	9.874951998205692
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	2.932178739979389
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	6.16599936056265
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).	4.800102800132358
Armpits’ oniony sweat.	8.55639188197318
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).	5.188975228226983
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	9.824955311349097
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	14.053413924763879
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	21.361882972876924
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	6.103559461482941
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	10.655960338184167
Mr Bloom beheld it.	10.64814717445105
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: —I’ll take this one.	8.113896310199477
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	8.141885800096073
—_Sweets of Sin,_ he said, tapping on it.	11.84982084313088
That’s a good one.	8.955512334083565
* * * The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.	17.72127256603407
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	31.450583823636723
Four and nine.	7.174997299464295
Those lovely curtains.	12.82704132222452
Five shillings.	8.572509804002673
Cosy curtains.	11.725328032605423
Selling new at two guineas.	8.287173002997996
Any advance on five shillings?	13.730731630129982
Going for five shillings.	6.9891193289536195
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: —Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	10.710973519132052
A.	9.643960518690632
Jackson, W.	4.834730197119341
E.	10.582866589593744
Wylie, A.	5.57442378248649
Munro and H.	5.95504205364476
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	9.782286235803728
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.	14.915606077750235
He halted near his daughter.	16.6993393249347
—It’s time for you, she said.	3.4588617906456367
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	33.22900812496693
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	17.547408343542948
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	6.42674846488366
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	21.568671381709855
—Stand up straight, girl, he said.	5.250517098492386
You’ll get curvature of the spine.	22.077960866735935
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	11.798825784848946
—Give it up, father, Dilly said.	8.290080108640373
All the people are looking at you.	10.419993119290764
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	12.503652878541056
—Did you get any money?	18.777832000620734
Dilly asked.	6.175031302735487
Mr Dedalus said.	3.546703817366021
—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	12.782243294554949
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	36.008558997261034
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street.	9.122198301777361
—I know you did, Dilly answered.	16.068192922043938
—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling.	84.3530224036422
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	24.99956143256548
He handed her a shilling.	25.557895908571126
—See if you can do anything with that, he said.	7.953860204801868
—I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	12.03628369092104
Give me more than that.	14.472108152308081
—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	127.24411264706032
You’re like the rest of them, are you?	11.526951229586388
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	7.198743938704343
But wait awhile.	14.390728640684879
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	15.861672612940586
Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you.	6.594211949027482
Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff.	19.52521403980918
He’s dead.	18.904932490664205
The man upstairs is dead.	7.400769232977532
He left her and walked on.	9.627381785376148
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	7.829828317479428
—Well, what is it?	4.8775137673363895
he said, stopping.	21.28716320451352
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	7.082246880809882
—Barang! —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	32.49351565764952
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: —Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	8.346393439097197
—Watch him, he said.	4.136812312740217
It’s instructive.	33.679588401656495
I wonder will he allow us to talk.	10.71609219464794
—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	8.008493665624234
—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	27.96217351750415
I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	14.113958650595007
Look, there’s all I have.	13.335792490463342
I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.	17.213160604910527
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	11.82789192868046
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere?	24.55053481996688
Dilly said.	3.3687121946888055
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	17.654504954626148
—I will, he said gravely.	23.426120614132618
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street.	7.826789384012132
I’ll try this one now.	8.999329387014374
—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	12.885873993624124
—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies.	67.09477000351806
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	17.9066221555929
I’ll be home shortly.	10.218941534669352
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	13.024571871101132
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	13.335242951378893
—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	6.552645380574471
The lacquey banged loudly.	9.629242549499857
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices.	9.922982887304507
Got round him all right.	12.228160835089753
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	14.843114277263526
First rate, sir.	5.613841494037567
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	23.768149752471366
How are things going?	10.804107280185692
Just keeping alive.	9.011073697575434
Lovely weather we’re having.	20.844403606842395
Yes, indeed.	17.145353924689207
Good for the country.	18.839097280394945
Those farmers are always grumbling.	10.102177045409267
Yes, sir.	4.524570451398352
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	6.14633179370776
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	11.700211893077451
And heartrending scenes.	11.148858409578036
Men trampling down women and children.	6.823763429902485
Most brutal thing.	6.326166465683635
Spontaneous combustion.	12.599684944605478
Most scandalous revelation.	11.148858409578036
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	11.080531519002989
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	6.792970304162233
Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	17.905681891617586
You know why?	16.95168744062237
Palm oil.	11.725328032605423
Is that a fact?	8.369308435029664
Without a doubt.	10.76180868613814
Well now, look at that.	12.915938093660593
And America they say is the land of the free.	15.76688380588912
I thought we were bad here.	11.407573891088925
I smiled at him.	5.918448984626138
_America,_ I said quietly, just like that.	19.402643476652827
_What is it?	4.6358738308084515
The sweepings of every country including our own.	7.550044066684117
Isn’t that true?_ That’s a fact.	14.050706483344223
Graft, my dear sir.	8.529375109463558
Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up.	17.831805451187808
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	20.058563057432767
Dress does it.	3.9447879085184323
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	13.826054036788257
Bowls them over.	7.540198132695
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	3.346987643579129
How are things?	10.846967812434627
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	27.97302186030783
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	12.111665722568238
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	8.779729698475581
Scott of Dawson street.	6.106969784964247
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.	8.29661680122877
Never built under three guineas.	8.69702659900256
Fits me down to the ground.	10.26856493968572
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	6.8473668259857075
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	14.42279462224829
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	11.23170689216435
Knight of the road.	15.338283348149526
Gentleman.	32.13581597679176
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	17.00930558854592
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	9.336037210945879
North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	10.07069045748435
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	14.59831795361162
High colour, of course.	8.022554604648201
Grizzled moustache.	10.595029903244942
Returned Indian officer.	9.70564496856689
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	5.452610100739228
Is that Ned Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam?	20.012642447601657
Yes.	9.732442163148734
He’s as like it as damn it.	11.28886806804723
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	15.299579090129242
Just a flash like that.	10.046046785286041
Damn like him.	6.656054675163753
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	7.384308108352473
Good drop of gin, that was.	6.820355230048033
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	9.905189812683112
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	10.071981888054502
Greasy black rope.	9.70564496856689
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife drove by in her noddy.	18.183672716608793
Bad times those were.	8.279211252996465
Well, well.	13.596979742032923
Over and done with.	11.206205372670988
Great topers too.	4.387016086573923
Fourbottle men.	7.841199444473143
Let me see.	6.164997151261152
Is he buried in saint Michan’s?	14.956102543441512
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	16.359690928080806
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	13.442503704295921
Dignam is there now.	7.131200658231559
Went out in a puff.	34.77908506855869
Well, well.	13.596979742032923
Better turn down here.	4.849045233895016
Make a detour.	19.16681357793786
Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom.	14.436637803430445
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	10.754562375422983
Damn dangerous thing.	6.326166465683635
Runaway horse.	10.595029903244942
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	11.60021656621522
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	7.271552787135431
Times of the troubles.	46.145519077957026
Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.	8.95772058332898
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	24.892914958860782
Gaming at Daly’s.	5.0646510716959225
No cardsharping then.	5.475411844292782
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	19.70297562597411
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	6.061046263445814
Stables behind Moira house.	4.82759006321294
Damn good gin that was.	5.764713126995643
Fine dashing young nobleman.	7.622878559556313
Good stock, of course.	8.022554604648201
That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away.	13.771942755043383
Course they were on the wrong side.	26.82075745087649
They rose in dark and evil days.	8.633649234986065
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	14.815294841190548
They were gentlemen.	17.94127522192965
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	13.099851005378065
Masterly rendition.	16.58211792698403
_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._ A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	5.609690544463907
Cream sunshades.	13.943843522115227
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	17.312855782026986
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	6.860125973811805
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	9.86059108788572
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	20.7859720089074
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	8.499479351844142
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	5.364310085123233
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	16.891257418203182
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	11.581449070983897
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	4.230063948505067
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	8.527231271753156
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	4.679190216995198
A long and seafed silent rut.	9.617059472346316
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	9.717375429151582
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.	12.330231954955012
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	9.896969643567743
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	14.695080603509547
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	8.488000613038938
A lore of drugs.	8.55639188197318
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	4.666858527579396
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	6.41835761308146
Beingless beings.	13.943843522115227
Your heart you sing of.	5.6091446836895
I between them.	5.6279840443095415
Where?	14.036610527842967
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	6.415681321247506
Shatter them, one and both.	31.504019256184296
But stun myself too in the blow.	14.578318470211007
Shatter me you who can.	12.404947083944815
Bawd and butcher were the words.	8.75050087452284
I say! Not yet awhile.	17.35160288553426
A look around.	8.949652011548354
Yes, quite true.	19.328296523750904
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.	3.7791566464955655
You say right, sir.	4.767378344877898
A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.	13.21324394628019
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	17.619039822693907
In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	5.90225332407893
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	6.626207511906368
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	5.366141707426721
And they are throbbing: heroes’ hearts.	9.040802135428915
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	21.827499324338028
—Twopence each, the huckster said.	10.613471630666398
Tattered pages.	12.599684944605478
_The Irish Beekeeper.	14.786396833216765
Life and Miracles of the Curé of Ars.	12.049346009026879
Pocket Guide to Killarney._ I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes.	14.12849970257658
Binding too good probably.	5.511493857370463
What is this?	13.541774675081617
Eighth and ninth book of Moses.	11.504118573543057
Secret of all secrets.	19.973335134057507
Seal of King David.	12.116599241714928
Thumbed pages: read and read.	13.353591809296955
Who has passed here before me?	11.206570836802902
How to soften chapped hands.	6.214377813127797
Recipe for white wine vinegar.	6.4148509902083335
How to win a woman’s love.	19.969625418404213
For me this.	16.929329548756318
Say the following talisman three times with hands folded: —_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._ Who wrote this?	5.13345732350982
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged.	8.110321767310392
As good as any other abbot’s charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.	12.91707384192801
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your wool.	10.534976170610092
—What are you doing here, Stephen?	19.54871252258335
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.	13.802915567335873
Shut the book quick.	12.338988222343596
Don’t let see.	9.539394355335538
—What are you doing?	17.566754556233604
Stephen said.	4.142530577726673
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	5.689508796314295
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	6.672973408360061
I told her of Paris.	14.615521740707232
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.	9.102635363231713
_Nebrakada femininum._ —What have you there?	19.75229519661686
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	20.370188202078058
Is it any good?	23.426623907702137
My eyes they say she has.	18.290053040543363
Do others see me so?	9.864530780624644
Quick, far and daring.	12.112600047251115
Shadow of my mind.	15.015674959844658
He took the coverless book from her hand.	11.138756310734063
Chardenal’s French primer.	29.97825578467801
—What did you buy that for?	27.192220645169627
To learn French?	16.92538249648606
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	5.760077327578898
Show no surprise.	8.080465848484218
Quite natural.	13.943843522115227
—Here, Stephen said.	5.608572966227139
It’s all right.	5.592046872441169
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.	8.706102468782085
I suppose all my books are gone.	10.162940354487667
—Some, Dilly said.	4.657890191971556
We had to.	16.40436299916229
She is drowning.	23.800675310486728
Agenbite.	25.50621404370786
Save her.	5.297514951622471
Agenbite.	25.50621404370786
All against us.	5.574429204789018
She will drown me with her, eyes and hair.	13.903232531947959
Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul.	16.423828719000312
Salt green death.	6.0082205141070855
We. Agenbite of inwit.	7.1875908020176835
Inwit’s agenbite.	39.76832468340524
Misery! Misery! * * * —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	4.1134960455652605
How are things?	10.846967812434627
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	27.97302186030783
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s.	4.323323539177745
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	7.163254863641599
—What’s the best news?	9.483821459605483
Mr Dedalus said.	3.546703817366021
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	7.139349150099015
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	20.734947882018954
—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	36.615983497409026
Who is it?	9.867507734124299
—O, Father Cowley said.	4.995687584095469
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	16.077708674919702
—With a broken back, is it?	11.963698529867948
—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	15.645949393369246
Reuben of that ilk.	21.300515748740285
I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard.	13.847156733226571
He’s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	13.77959861480448
All I want is a little time.	19.03067138738738
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	15.486172309441914
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	82.75772572313949
Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone.	14.481982796517265
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	18.657649383344246
—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.	9.974974544690872
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	7.585877289009021
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	10.636874100013658
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	8.738156809545059
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure.	12.416033080113959
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?	24.116697430636723
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	12.043458580921998
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	19.977122016114986
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	12.287685872375238
Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet.	10.313655629017823
Father Cowley asked.	12.0300554305883
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	5.692419906926981
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	15.168965758680455
—Aw! he said.	3.0617397882484845
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	42.954598157009805
—What about that?	16.72464742208763
Ben Dollard said.	3.74650063900367
Not too dusty?	14.786396833216765
He turned to both.	16.652195523133344
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	14.980097496239116
The reverend Hugh C.	5.122448899230054
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.	8.027726697404795
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	12.458872750441342
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.	11.852233945808623
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	21.26346800859322
He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	9.446940861796035
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.	10.197670237836787
Come along.	24.81632615462123
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t...	13.100376703762137
Wait awhile...	4.801062254443455
We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	9.966264459619762
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	18.935308608772655
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	13.705533312487535
—What few days?	33.827785190485635
he boomed.	16.58211792698403
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?	11.913523719300342
—He has, Father Cowley said.	6.126177525001047
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	13.34594861768797
The landlord has the prior claim.	8.233815053337768
I gave him all the particulars.	18.83750911230275
29 Windsor avenue.	8.4492546945381
Love is the name?	21.905505231700584
The reverend Mr Love.	18.468674954037606
He’s a minister in the country somewhere.	17.47951967572848
But are you sure of that?	17.646539282086625
—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.	16.70779784445517
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	18.200771109628896
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	23.095898962557687
* * * —The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	14.364675124250454
The policeman touched his forehead.	8.281033538560886
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	11.554087224965503
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	13.838619823340222
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	11.741032405664146
—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	16.71355001849814
—Boyd?	16.58211792698403
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	15.592799087821135
Touch me not.	9.467906498216415
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	11.259024658966602
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.	6.58765647549584
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	3.900983003196661
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	14.549982453259455
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	13.671533836127894
And put down the five shillings too.	13.5263260726441
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	5.53235791861656
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	6.796242785617202
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	7.22511188117461
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	19.755129040057096
They went down Parliament street.	11.628561041090515
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.	11.698042281275681
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	3.3841729238840395
Here goes.	9.27938997935109
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	9.645411775961644
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.	15.930574508270311
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	10.913230300128108
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms.	14.894154150130895
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	6.620227217740107
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	9.798889467857453
—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	15.33280861267205
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	13.919975332553138
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	13.106534900955836
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	6.077426859689923
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	9.638264927753111
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	6.928581998228274
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	12.119477888020302
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	28.79271164419158
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	12.312827750470964
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	13.701816151614432
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	8.82161830958454
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	11.400980862504925
—What Dignam was that?	12.195572671266508
long John Fanning asked.	8.212018741630938
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	22.041875146648017
—O, my corns! he said plaintively.	19.1132113863367
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	8.857238150310755
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	11.857423378715229
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.	22.47679979623963
I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	13.500779786841983
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	10.94518674274975
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	11.085697334609343
—Rather lowsized.	14.786396833216765
Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	8.14849620633186
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	7.760521240195551
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	6.13932890329361
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
All turned where they stood.	12.097282916833851
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	8.596324596236576
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	13.924358789121122
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	10.916083891910766
In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.	17.13396730440217
—What was it?	10.129340258910986
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	19.635468214695173
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	10.318116708611464
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: —Parnell’s brother.	11.944401205198243
There in the corner.	14.402757203372815
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	6.915894593130107
—Is that he?	29.199011576170147
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	20.98649616997823
—Yes, Mulligan said.	7.292957572935416
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	32.57444832529749
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	11.066571052920185
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	12.739707999785715
—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.	15.693931562577761
—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.	5.334992436632982
When she had gone he said, laughing: —We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes.	24.204721913430472
O, but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet._ Haines opened his newbought book.	9.165564489217203
—I’m sorry, he said.	5.453458150450613
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	13.75699789099207
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street: —_England expects_...	11.801098114583283
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	15.136253973458178
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	16.392882500489254
Wandering Ængus I call him.	4.461056331080397
—I am sure he has an _idée fixe,_ Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger.	11.210013305231834
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	17.483906077511335
Such persons always have.	4.71554917311125
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	25.390290627161807
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	16.17831235199498
He will never capture the Attic note.	7.591171246084201
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth.	12.774474941690904
That is his tragedy.	24.463185250082724
He can never be a poet.	17.987777635586536
The joy of creation...	5.29882648359082
—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	8.142597199324005
I see.	8.216557747377024
I tackled him this morning on belief.	9.328596031747926
There was something on his mind, I saw.	29.371012650633187
It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	7.1745871697055845
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	12.946085649927339
He helped her to unload her tray.	8.30913248243208
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	10.615347375363198
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	11.671534731411812
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	10.503614213191943
Does he write anything for your movement?	13.737250603870313
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	8.65514031567363
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	8.05233322971591
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	16.574386962267802
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	12.779005142282571
He is going to write something in ten years.	10.14055013032267
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	11.823895390132998
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.	14.742858482847545
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	13.968916155786692
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	11.985498542338057
I don’t want to be imposed on.	9.870498789686469
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	6.390068165613646
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.	12.304099072622396
Behind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square.	10.36550600080673
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	15.421929837375208
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	9.384382972817058
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn.	17.69970131286874
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	6.901316090734159
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: —_Coactus volui._ He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	9.660464599969279
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	8.048003815258557
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	9.25813598899513
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	11.000817848370897
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.	12.613795446334137
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	11.09679330512353
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	5.69270949642109
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props.	17.00311439643613
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	6.567203418458958
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns.	11.128759453828268
Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.	14.014348304295842
Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	9.16603079343834
Two bar entrance, soldiers half price.	5.688397190020534
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	12.9898703905174
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	23.29446650769882
That’s me in mourning.	26.940233700152362
When is it?	6.148420547898318
May the twentysecond.	16.92538249648606
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	21.310727663717287
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	20.386525402508187
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	17.155289799260924
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	11.205187756110535
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	10.09296801162919
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	12.136376203720713
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	7.428927539492126
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	20.701227230478384
No Sandymount tram.	7.554588130286805
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	10.562035634111563
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	10.341111652508078
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	10.231529520547214
He met schoolboys with satchels.	8.665330132049261
I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	8.868221491057533
He met other schoolboys.	9.645223575437983
Do they notice I’m in mourning?	14.189857303402373
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.	13.423945416841306
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name.	15.448225754202472
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	16.132135307553895
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	15.5531704396791
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend.	15.210702206370682
A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking.	16.497007141820475
How was that?	10.56532800913548
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney’s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt.	16.54553373731805
Never see him again.	11.844055132395809
Death, that is.	6.701357311337003

Begin! Bronze by gold, miss Douce’s head by miss Kennedy’s head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.	10.323808147404131
—Is that her?	18.826314810809468
asked miss Kennedy.	11.607647247737312
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._ —Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	12.748274423975413
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: —Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	19.61521547690146
—Who?	8.672134463555837
Where?	14.036610527842967
gold asked more eagerly.	6.347442741854127
—In the second carriage, miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the sun.	18.324984368013983
He’s looking.	25.09024253014235
Mind till I see.	7.013816284652666
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	13.652785636580616
Her wet lips tittered: —He’s killed looking back.	9.298216445634768
She laughed: —O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?	11.343273791868585
With sadness.	16.58211792698403
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	6.969017856415192
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	2.8075851280180535
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	5.905034977871819
—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	9.50604047947561
A man.	16.113349014977885
Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.	17.152189103243867
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	16.552722090435495
For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.	9.946493725019772
And —There’s your teas, he said.	5.353020031741528
loud boots unmannerly asked.	4.428841212007943
—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	13.185785090797346
—Your _beau,_ is it?	8.873384982826913
A haughty bronze replied: —I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.	12.382807787795393
—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.	9.921558072791145
Bloom.	7.724644464000979
On her flower frowning miss Douce said: —Most aggravating that young brat is.	7.389260341393441
If he doesn’t conduct himself I’ll wring his ear for him a yard long.	13.265403408529805
Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	8.55639188197318
—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	14.929077958752691
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	25.7788608754107
They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw.	7.403514869050438
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	13.108889305070905
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	10.520903665463079
—Am I awfully sunburnt?	10.72381534492056
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	7.7201680268711375
—No, said miss Kennedy.	23.348412193039454
It gets brown after.	5.2854087922740955
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	15.201706800118435
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.	11.279003036087827
—And leave it to my hands, she said.	4.393449895654986
—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	16.987382897925507
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce —Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	8.25054819370083
I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.	19.803645735863192
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: —O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake! —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	13.468160181905086
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	6.666044907350195
—No, don’t, she cried.	2.6993489200048706
—I won’t listen, she cried.	2.417540365546765
But Bloom?	13.27180360185742
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone: —For your what?	10.412572950609661
says he.	6.2246949987246945
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: —Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire.	20.62916447801529
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	12.244341173094249
—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	11.658197320138367
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat.	9.837292205634016
—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	13.848309137876825
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	9.910612062497869
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: —And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name.	7.990756745491541
Why do I always think Figather?	21.410934288912493
Gathering figs, I think.	7.107091381663381
And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.	10.58668995821533
By Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by.	17.407840295313655
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	15.442694945599618
God they believe she is: or goddess.	19.226484036772703
Those today.	7.274431494472446
I could not see.	13.114349709690314
That fellow spoke.	12.808961334324536
A student.	11.725328032605423
After with Dedalus’ son.	5.3768261431325985
He might be Mulligan.	14.238840201940734
All comely virgins.	8.080465848484218
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	8.256745275927845
By went his eyes.	4.714466497970947
The sweets of sin.	4.94339352184169
Sweet are the sweets.	11.544961768973721
Of sin.	9.85978631029179
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	4.669984962459464
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	10.162120465934711
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	8.756991395257858
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	11.216088655149475
Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes.	7.4832113539241885
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: —O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	8.708277563738108
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	9.006767730674946
—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	15.050685092308383
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	7.787010335155834
And then laughed more.	9.704199989790451
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	6.090511110878587
All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.	17.87805850989007
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	37.28776060401857
—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	13.332522598535828
I wished I hadn’t laughed so much.	11.019703250471482
I feel all wet.	15.885347169146511
—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	21.27920914800208
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	12.10875118731576
By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of their oils.	16.37614862879196
Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	9.84117789478482
Religion pays.	13.943843522115227
Must see him for that par.	24.51296477345666
Eat first.	7.145629591813955
I want.	21.18181962740543
Not yet.	7.783945180633887
At four, she said.	0.6872155312637865
Time ever passing.	8.4492546945381
Clockhands turning.	11.089130599646298
On. Where eat?	13.947054902944494
The Clarence, Dolphin.	10.82639741088797
On. For Raoul.	12.660727695075956
Eat.	32.13581597679176
If I net five guineas with those ads.	9.51381226041073
The violet silk petticoats.	11.406622102943356
Not yet.	7.783945180633887
The sweets of sin.	4.94339352184169
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	10.786072267510539
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	8.110777472262164
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	9.591525356835067
Chips.	25.50621404370786
He strolled.	30.869685532944267
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.	21.234980254492623
He held her hand.	11.492537925011272
Enjoyed her holidays?	11.148858409578036
—Tiptop.	12.212364007875731
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	8.73510113570976
—Gorgeous, she said.	0.3168999895820897
Look at the holy show I am.	29.07407001734443
Lying out on the strand all day.	13.254739374769027
Bronze whiteness.	13.943843522115227
—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	51.59338870269046
Tempting poor simple males.	7.124763581548046
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	7.65771941533485
—O go away! she said.	9.271116128860054
You’re very simple, I don’t think.	9.777977937913485
He was.	22.001481323526928
—Well now I am, he mused.	30.92470206047846
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	11.16196359268807
—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	9.502097009156532
And what did the doctor order today?	17.25011668602932
—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself.	14.896690609416133
I think I’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	17.034405209668645
Jingle.	22.281730317965827
—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	13.358748192179789
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself.	11.48975929423882
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	8.195205071223338
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	16.953667869511364
Alacrity she served.	7.598925624375338
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	9.158286260642534
—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	16.291923861736777
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	17.049022602095192
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	10.500365225826847
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Yes.	9.732442163148734
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the bowl.	17.290861404338493
Chips.	25.50621404370786
Shreds.	32.13581597679176
Musing.	32.13581597679176
Mute.	32.13581597679176
None nought said nothing.	5.734709192015567
Yes.	9.732442163148734
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: —_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_ —Was Mr Lidwell in today?	14.959381971556464
In came Lenehan.	8.72241508875831
Round him peered Lenehan.	5.511493857370463
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	15.590374643310327
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	14.794228636874202
To Martha I must write.	10.745028354279409
Buy paper.	7.841199444473143
Daly’s.	6.971601284071301
Girl there civil.	11.148858409578036
Bloom.	7.724644464000979
Old Bloom.	4.985676728737677
Blue bloom is on the rye.	13.697888743783718
—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	9.511835447129563
Lenehan came forward.	13.268634705831849
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	12.852948320531588
He asked.	11.495592740981188
She answered: —Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	22.320871047491075
She asked.	10.405771347419485
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: —No. He was not.	31.121678917983925
Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.	14.856782661829747
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	6.955555663074684
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?	14.600054180547508
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	9.112792408532288
To mind her stops.	7.622878559556313
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	6.9044539597751715
Jingle jaunty jingle.	12.872306092276881
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	14.913394869857793
Take no notice.	12.219347994843824
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: —Ah fox met ah stork.	9.690345074458232
Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?	5.337065491347343
He droned in vain.	6.1442898934568095
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	24.628176922550225
He sighed aside: —Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	19.052214299956518
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	16.27649927182098
—Who may he be?	8.033519157686294
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	5.097223948368648
Who?	12.75310702185393
—Who may he be?	8.033519157686294
Can you ask?	31.362332919170882
Stephen, the youthful bard.	34.183772845538485
Dry.	32.13581597679176
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	14.318119308273227
—I see, he said.	6.020368639573673
I didn’t recognise him for the moment.	12.072334255325071
I hear he is keeping very select company.	9.910089075060837
He had.	28.35514966120436
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	16.52983283662577
In Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	21.476597078445163
He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: —The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	12.689386180653209
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O’Madden Burke.	9.741493277683801
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and —That must have been highly diverting, said he.	11.565510533715997
I see.	8.216557747377024
He see.	6.03491677736451
He drank.	31.566430066258537
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	4.261963328418416
Set down his glass.	11.517488087442528
He looked towards the saloon door.	18.691473616789914
—I see you have moved the piano.	19.68149436934829
—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.	17.803429181245146
—Is that a fact?	6.943180104884628
The real classical, you know.	5.541703068093722
And blind too, poor fellow.	10.566432913700865
Not twenty I’m sure he was.	8.646559715476448
—Is that a fact?	6.943180104884628
Mr Dedalus said.	3.546703817366021
He drank and strayed away.	8.251325242954431
—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	21.019142895271116
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.	14.015544107884738
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.	11.874360427036102
Lager for diner.	14.786396833216765
Lager without alacrity she served.	5.3861426748064
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	7.26097330897705
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	12.199789059029762
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	14.45886227794474
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought.	8.401885362771855
Are you not happy in your home?	8.204560488867124
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	14.745760663787912
Means something, language of flow.	9.447266439759986
Was it a daisy?	21.739134220256673
Innocence that is.	5.708092415471332
Respectable girl meet after mass.	5.627791510240851
Thanks awfully muchly.	11.148858409578036
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	10.230978536208918
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	4.666716990307677
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	8.55639188197318
For some man.	7.77140023383033
For Raoul.	14.433750202917158
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	7.608331897998532
It is.	10.115469952702798
Again.	20.244295502353957
Third time.	8.074194952136697
Coincidence.	22.281730317965827
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	9.73278179436808
Follow.	32.13581597679176
Risk it.	4.258023366747632
Go quick.	10.595029903244942
At four.	11.029822407684417
Near now.	5.230698116280242
Out.	22.281730317965827
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	11.2523537152665
—Aha...	3.8787561922106573
I was forgetting...	6.316038079897341
Excuse...	2.8418718209786236
—And four.	20.86522118735945
At four she.	7.111304845936613
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	6.562311198669924
Bloo smi qui go.	5.511493857370463
Ternoon.	32.13581597679176
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?	16.195923173131206
Does that to all.	16.498737434545102
For men.	7.841199444473143
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	8.446701036983722
From the saloon a call came, long in dying.	14.150378766210533
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	30.300024730186827
A call again.	4.883734682030202
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	18.081531444480145
You hear?	11.035116586329263
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	6.453041241471069
Longer in dying call.	8.031415415994449
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	12.577452626800174
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	6.511715522991076
_the morn is breaking._ A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands.	4.579746027786078
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.	19.064157470089192
—_The dewdrops pearl_...	3.3956065448979023
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	16.967588325784458
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	13.52948334479859
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	12.229092188578042
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	4.862879048273556
—Did she fall or was she pushed?	12.825479685785474
he asked her.	8.815180508928972
She answered, slighting: —Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.	9.796778755479053
Like lady, ladylike.	14.752059185197528
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	12.959573434794022
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	26.491262856635814
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: —See the conquering hero comes.	11.506746362041914
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	13.49381413704771
See me he might.	17.223510810017665
The seat he sat on: warm.	14.3481014089497
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	11.597113969278126
—_And I from thee_...	2.4285102068915774
—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	23.02041129577366
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	11.109897839447335
She smiled on him.	6.5970369518619965
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	17.406760677246982
Smart Boylan bespoke potions.	8.55639188197318
—What’s your cry?	18.985491493216333
Glass of bitter?	15.222019859105787
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	10.130315190354466
Wire in yet?	11.869655286702953
Not yet.	7.783945180633887
At four she.	7.111304845936613
Who said four?	12.872306092276881
Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s office.	13.94315516708243
Avoid.	32.13581597679176
Goulding a chance.	9.850079940221093
What is he doing in the Ormond?	28.67433862709492
Car waiting.	11.725328032605423
Hello.	16.067907988395877
Where off to?	10.889960356666615
Something to eat?	18.56894407176333
I too was just.	35.225783469425345
In here.	8.311924833470535
What, Ormond?	19.289122266343515
Best value in Dublin.	7.415037733339666
Is that so?	11.596893087322131
Diningroom.	32.13581597679176
Sit tight there.	6.139957340190341
See, not be seen.	47.83762016798315
I think I’ll join you.	8.396782372381772
Come on.	8.994870683542715
Bloom followed bag.	8.949652011548354
Dinner fit for a prince.	18.17615787779794
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	13.262818044546615
—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	15.150851664141813
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	6.831536738015511
—Why don’t you grow?	16.662897059902168
asked Blazes Boylan.	10.057863396914843
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: —Fine goods in small parcels.	13.988543071707182
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	8.665330132049261
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.	13.214853246472
He pitched a broad coin down.	4.7187406630562085
Coin rang.	12.212364007875731
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	10.149831727266532
—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	13.457568956012068
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	16.76911706743311
Not on my own, you know.	13.715896585010986
Fancy of a friend of mine.	11.967020492905315
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	12.70561740814162
Idolores.	25.50621404370786
The eastern seas.	12.872306092276881
Clock whirred.	13.943843522115227
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	13.061282773481961
Clock clacked.	10.842919411207617
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	11.772817391038616
Clock clacked.	10.842919411207617
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	10.876250081635911
Look to the west.	31.502937858653258
A clack.	16.58211792698403
For me.	8.025013669901437
—What time is that?	13.09710437792404
asked Blazes Boylan.	10.057863396914843
Four?	32.13581597679176
O’clock.	29.098782033196493
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.	9.613726510628718
—Let’s hear the time, he said.	19.040428635917007
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	5.27902246664513
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	9.144400281841111
Be near.	16.688409521161915
At four.	11.029822407684417
Has he forgotten?	15.222019859105787
Perhaps a trick.	11.827916284126271
Not come: whet appetite.	7.082569710069092
I couldn’t do.	9.267217944045488
Wait, wait.	17.30843033677879
Pat, waiter, waited.	8.288414301974955
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.	7.27189339779459
—Go on, pressed Lenehan.	7.264833361202549
There’s no-one.	7.142248608484159
He never heard.	22.049221434936474
—...	2.4299861334617914
_to Flora’s lips did hie._ High, a high note pealed in the treble clear.	14.697753895557032
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan’s flower and eyes.	7.727926070403074
—Please, please.	7.311896813381484
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	5.504583264405476
—_I could not leave thee_...	4.662338708889101
—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	9.046035741802184
—No, now, urged Lenehan.	14.029371055964159
_Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There’s no-one.	6.838915175803844
She looked.	18.97831695098517
Quick.	22.281730317965827
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	19.459367899839393
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	7.310076922287191
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	23.520413147115274
—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	4.599071312835648
Delayed.	32.13581597679176
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.	6.51091146056201
—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan.	6.710272811160593
Trained by owner.	15.222019859105787
No sawdust there.	4.629492620734669
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	8.41535643747596
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	2.452878983217728
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	17.381289013042608
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	7.697247806702777
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	7.366351347166542
Yes, bronze from anearby.	23.023073817468504
—...	2.4299861334617914
_Sweetheart, goodbye!_ —I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.	12.138829195982215
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	9.941232662489696
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	11.143157175536617
I wanted to tell you.	6.7730067278805635
Tom Rochford...	5.153094873094471
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	17.75050399396684
Lenehan gulped to go.	7.911506293744079
—Got the horn or what?	7.606837222300531
he said.	3.724527490343976
I’m coming.	14.612969173675225
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	16.979610455440522
—How do you do, Mr Dollard?	17.41251445658075
—Eh?	10.98663243565522
How do?	13.116927906745419
How do?	13.116927906745419
Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe.	19.657919586451722
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.	13.431694182307591
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	20.98546950813788
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	17.826708195479906
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	12.80455576754147
Give us a ditty.	18.180441956698104
We heard the piano.	11.849425160728694
Bald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders.	8.118097690363127
Power for Richie.	11.869655286702958
And Bloom?	19.282032723934798
Let me see.	6.164997151261152
His corns.	16.58211792698403
Four now.	5.230698116280242
How warm this black is.	3.8079582897995246
Course nerves a bit.	7.548447630430677
Let me see.	6.164997151261152
Cider.	32.13581597679176
Yes, bottle of cider.	22.241549452415686
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
Mr Dedalus said.	3.546703817366021
I was only vamping, man.	9.799473302328302
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	12.739277804554606
Begone dull care.	7.554588130286805
Come, Bob.	21.259750530701226
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	12.772827446631775
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	10.9466830178284
His gouty paws plumped chords.	6.708426236547828
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	12.948480417700898
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	12.864822062371445
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	14.606671715075356
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	8.55639188197318
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	12.58120888414441
He’s off.	17.836011095254815
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	9.645719193432331
Jingling.	32.13581597679176
He’s gone.	10.929998333919293
Jingle.	22.281730317965827
Hear.	32.13581597679176
—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	22.598559987434793
God be with old times.	14.739039298762235
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	15.205997429262558
Gone.	17.685021073205338
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	8.437572688014148
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de Nil._ —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	8.768540383172372
There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.	9.850462995635342
There was.	22.955357229922665
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	44.399160112204555
The devil wouldn’t stop him.	7.8539003115096095
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	21.056452463280397
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	11.82426015970784
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	12.679844913687836
He had no wed.	23.092042364640918
All trio laughed.	7.184257632960914
No wedding garment.	8.048963187695092
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	30.088898980417376
Where’s my pipe, by the way?	13.30904012352143
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	20.599369016064344
Bald Pat carried two diners’ drinks, Richie and Poldy.	9.160055900460996
And Father Cowley laughed again.	12.021988071681392
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	13.049431852000394
—You did, averred Ben Dollard.	17.921080146161582
I remember those tight trousers too.	6.759050714798658
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	18.649393870015743
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	16.633431915869977
He saved the situa.	15.331125603964113
Tight trou.	16.58211792698403
Brilliant ide.	16.58211792698403
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	10.204247816532263
Do you remember?	34.03106637365229
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh’s gave us the number.	22.112858113664817
Remember?	32.13581597679176
Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.	16.617781846258545
—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	2.544759372665098
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	11.854715393106313
—Merrion square style.	9.90202010094519
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	18.669725735369997
He wouldn’t take any money either.	9.54732467789588
—Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded.	75.96735361951895
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.	13.811740603720345
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	22.021593087857433
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	8.033053861831862
Liver and bacon.	19.61075504569421
Steak and kidney pie.	10.559871460837
Right, sir.	5.7208361520598405
Right, Pat.	16.545798889571536
Mrs Marion.	9.256197713267152
Met him pike hoses.	6.590833710555275
Smell of burn.	19.61075504569421
Of Paul de Kock.	11.992669792171784
Nice name he.	6.805102621709831
—What’s this her name was?	23.87192035586172
A buxom lassy.	11.148858409578036
Marion...	3.7049358717196887
—Tweedy.	12.599684944605478
Is she alive?	15.956519438506938
—And kicking.	29.342393085596125
—She was a daughter of...	12.611608199164536
—Daughter of the regiment.	24.602532917780582
—Yes, begad.	25.745637563863347
I remember the old drummajor.	36.459123791715385
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after —Irish?	7.073711354110369
I don’t know, faith.	10.532678108522832
Is she, Simon?	24.447048907841918
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.	8.811561317680972
—Buccinator muscle is...	3.212470828016506
What?...	3.1855253369858803
Bit rusty...	2.739065420347036
O, she is...	1.8070050400423097
My Irish Molly, O.	7.66346184298417
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.	7.3326503106833325
—From the rock of Gibraltar...	8.036350512353968
all the way.	18.02326909616614
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two.	6.606638498365905
Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.	12.685918657579712
Pat served, uncovered dishes.	10.601794175163626
Leopold cut liverslices.	11.148858409578036
As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.	5.526227150120323
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.	10.027426401961915
Dinners fit for princes.	12.564838397146701
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.	8.672921017053394
Horn.	20.244295502353957
Have you the?	10.552298126763754
Horn.	20.244295502353957
Have you the?	10.552298126763754
Haw haw horn.	11.869655286702958
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: —_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	3.907531421100335
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.	10.755754230601399
—War! War! cried Father Cowley.	6.023710215389404
You’re the warrior.	14.247743649901835
—So I am, Ben Warrior laughed.	19.41329043193568
I was thinking of your landlord.	31.0879327882708
Love or money.	10.144287806266288
He stopped.	17.822621252244467
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	8.508916002945206
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	20.80748927335416
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.	9.700643103416272
He would.	24.118301466913078
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.	10.141381164157274
Half time, Ben.	16.957833960184416
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.	7.635977202342259
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.	6.437285893195182
She passed a remark.	17.742188061816474
It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.	29.310617895581675
They drank cool stout.	5.98972880894262
Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?	19.101614074164015
And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring.	6.083484242804174
No, she couldn’t say.	2.3397781957752732
But it would be in the paper.	16.462802694494957
O, she need not trouble.	3.4027890346557688
No trouble.	10.19448965235056
Too much trouble, first gentleman said.	7.827571581890079
O, not in the least.	47.64633390923294
Way he looked that.	8.79190897465267
Lord lieutenant.	12.599684944605478
Gold by bronze heard iron steel.	6.5247264395704825
_my ardent soul I care not foror the morrow._ In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes.	5.251996258657629
Love and War someone is.	4.756566015436022
Ben Dollard’s famous.	24.436033911852128
Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert.	13.466743620179457
Trousers tight as a drum on him.	7.732694033028777
Musical porkers.	16.58211792698403
Molly did laugh when he went out.	9.087220727048432
Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking.	10.347847804129318
With all his belongings on show.	5.441833683503426
O saints above, I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone.	17.0499644097802
For instance eunuchs.	21.434076424131987
Nice touch.	10.595029903244942
Must be Cowley.	19.233339231321033
Musical.	32.13581597679176
Knows whatever note you play.	8.287173002997996
Bad breath he has, poor chap.	18.647698473709124
Stopped.	32.13581597679176
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering.	8.720431706301213
Good afternoon.	17.93286308139831
She gave her moist (a lady’s) hand to his firm clasp.	15.123691291625846
Afternoon.	32.13581597679176
Yes, she was back.	1.9883852234965074
To the old dingdong again.	19.682452538589907
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.	14.757310629007465
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.	11.64429606938047
Bloom ate liv as said before.	6.1079302919225285
That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle.	12.51917960528453
No-one here: Goulding and I.	11.662070581533401
Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins.	5.988678974153003
Pat to and fro.	7.438954514198271
Bald Pat.	23.710579953425565
Nothing to do.	11.985666131635375
Best value in Dub.	5.677556487027062
Piano again.	5.175583470401267
Cowley it is.	5.567660174041145
Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding.	17.51063799951203
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache.	6.5677800213719415
Her high long snore.	10.82639741088797
Night we were in the box.	15.123441787175027
Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.	6.801946886566076
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy.	14.305437866904809
Do right to hide them.	10.111478155802429
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.	7.622878559556313
Only the harp.	18.329227630491133
Lovely.	32.13581597679176
Gold glowering light.	6.901633021014249
Girl touched it.	3.757377520435574
Poop of a lovely.	38.05416505516731
Gravy’s rather good fit for a.	19.421039841636208
Golden ship.	11.089130599646298
Erin.	25.50621404370786
The harp that once or twice.	7.689043313626145
Cool hands.	7.085323528730332
Ben Howth, the rhododendrons.	37.71435033444919
We are their harps.	22.98949420451237
He. Old.	14.786396833216765
Young.	32.13581597679176
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.	38.108282553070126
Strongly.	32.13581597679176
—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled.	14.510312707289463
Get it out in bits.	12.28163148515441
—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.	4.648521443132651
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld.	8.225633288513801
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.	13.497594832190384
Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows.	16.49631181192665
Farewell.	22.281730317965827
A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.	10.304518129173232
Cowley sang: _—M’appari tutt’amor: Il mio sguardo l’incontr..._ She waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.	12.896078013943265
—Go on, Simon.	10.910018750932801
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben...	13.04334786619518
Well...	3.168254680321378
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.	16.178465494590686
—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned.	11.045608168866416
Play it in the original.	14.299277552981904
One flat.	11.089130599646298
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.	7.676268287343957
Up stage strode Father Cowley.	6.181736032659431
Get up.	7.84289648915647
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.	16.181703042788634
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding.	7.788543340710875
Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.	5.816761349927471
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He heard Joe Maas sing that one night.	12.163039250041496
Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes.	17.749099765402836
In his way.	12.42254390189343
Choirboy style.	11.089130599646298
Maas was the boy.	17.035180865837386
Massboy.	32.13581597679176
A lyrical tenor if you like.	10.998919301805124
Never forget it.	5.809491808915994
Never.	25.50621404370786
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.	7.0335776319502035
Backache he.	6.061679814198452
Bright’s bright eye.	14.74453077462029
Next item on the programme.	17.80008475119197
Paying the piper.	11.148858409578036
Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.	13.094211490123117

Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate.	11.690316989571299

Characteristic of him.	3.970087387227964
Power.	18.793139189616713
Particular about his drink.	12.619552603586861
Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water.	11.49502405929239
Fecking matches from counters to save.	8.38613991257032
Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.	4.870325330502861
And when he’s wanted not a farthing.	28.290368589333234
Screwed refusing to pay his fare.	11.7314643782994
Curious types.	16.58211792698403
Never would Richie forget that night.	4.751272323251424
As long as he lived: never.	20.139185868593707
In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.	27.057689921004165
And when the first note.	28.17270895353087
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.	7.8874045022456025
Coming out with a whopper now.	13.390824212259918
Rhapsodies about damn all.	5.502743878712974
Believes his own lies.	17.818248800605083
Does really.	9.105249025485831
Wonderful liar.	16.58211792698403
But want a good memory.	18.070606513745794
—Which air is that?	8.235513982046932
asked Leopold Bloom.	6.314915285540626
—_All is lost now_.	10.477302337961495
Richie cocked his lips apout.	13.46121241768501
A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all.	3.64154702825727
A thrush.	11.035116586329268
A throstle.	12.212364007875731
His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe.	9.53640981112379
Is lost.	9.573690248878348
Rich sound.	10.19448965235056
Two notes in one there.	7.950615276715847
Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.	26.335007257548696
Taking my motives he twined and turned them.	4.64022839440347
All most too new call is lost in all.	7.010478620705851
Echo.	32.13581597679176
How sweet the answer.	6.893959934627134
How is that done?	26.66106539450844
All lost now.	5.2250220368414775
Mournful he whistled.	11.148858409578036
Fall, surrender, lost.	9.322880666099126
Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.	11.740147739138145
Order.	32.13581597679176
Lovely air.	7.085323528730332
In sleep she went to him.	1.5757743299378884
Innocence in the moon.	15.17894988107692
Brave.	32.13581597679176
Don’t know their danger.	14.015579001194604
Still hold her back.	6.289803651368698
Call name.	7.20859276391317
Touch water.	7.5719552805519275
Jingle jaunty.	19.8459753406449
Too late.	13.4330363537961
She longed to go.	7.911506293744079
That’s why.	17.070924675557535
Woman.	20.244295502353957
As easy stop the sea.	6.506760192738658
Yes: all is lost.	12.219907369137967
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.	14.117669043850254
I know it well.	15.923595424951756
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.	12.371295169867082
He knows it well too.	8.750033639445222
Or he feels.	14.786396833216765
Still harping on his daughter.	15.564115639469232
Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said.	7.5658063595982
Me?	17.685021073205338
Bloom askance over liverless saw.	6.236313947861035
Face of the all is lost.	21.338328698223577
Rollicking Richie once.	6.064381874161732
Jokes old stale now.	3.9649444280784425
Wagging his ear.	6.9344149348409285
Napkinring in his eye.	8.421989947737982
Now begging letters he sends his son with.	7.544526232705911
Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.	6.29263096575
Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money.	13.143369875577333
Apologise.	32.13581597679176
Piano again.	5.175583470401267
Sounds better than last time I heard.	16.836719695697667
Tuned probably.	8.572509804002673
Stopped again.	5.909382163877581
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	4.4380686249258225
—With it, Simon.	20.982176517241786
—It, Simon.	12.189924067098218
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.	10.234671690164143
—It, Simon.	12.189924067098218
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	16.755931743948416
The harping chords of prelude closed.	6.16599936056265
A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.	5.844821544601738
—_When first I saw that form endearing_...	4.647878268677583
Richie turned.	10.19448965235056
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.	5.8953776329185805
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	4.431921504864205
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	10.480154175160473
The door of the bar.	19.57622416011426
So. That will do.	8.713785941709808
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	13.776294276693243
—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._ Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives.	9.83381797652723
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	10.602264448737424
When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	14.744325931549055
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.	8.650391156848436
Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	8.489281416569876
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	7.72902340309254
—_Full of hope and all delighted_...	4.970316454496001
Tenors get women by the score.	17.60271895092984
Increase their flow.	8.4492546945381
Throw flower at his feet.	8.174174025994677
When will we meet?	8.394577437194766
My head it simply.	7.585099644216945
Jingle all delighted.	11.148858409578036
He can’t sing for tall hats.	8.054523979982346
Your head it simply swurls.	6.194709281870844
Perfumed for him.	4.840134060785728
What perfume does your wife?	8.153272356678091
I want to know.	10.600357245881012
Jing.	32.13581597679176
Stop.	20.244295502353957
Knock.	32.13581597679176
Last look at mirror always before she answers the door.	7.134390259881356
The hall.	9.573690248878348
There?	22.281730317965827
How do you?	8.52809131584439
I do well.	15.52678661891161
There?	22.281730317965827
Or?	25.50621404370786
Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel.	14.261055217232204
Yes?	18.7931391896167
Hands felt for the opulent.	11.150843480513148
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	11.601490843475535
—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...	3.2732371848666677
Glorious tone he has still.	9.696165368717482
Cork air softer also their brogue.	6.14633179370776
Silly man! Could have made oceans of money.	8.858624994658648
Singing wrong words.	5.95504205364476
Wore out his wife: now sings.	16.287113929176318
But hard to tell.	14.354172421444865
Only the two themselves.	18.544359921206553
If he doesn’t break down.	9.242538499192182
Keep a trot for the avenue.	16.690752266052133
His hands and feet sing too.	8.05634020182351
Drink.	32.13581597679176
Nerves overstrung.	16.58211792698403
Must be abstemious to sing.	19.04422495899242
Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream.	8.308510065690772
For creamy dreamy.	11.148858409578036
Tenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed.	6.4509364025500835
That’s the chat.	19.22846917203512
Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.	10.217304421999875
Words?	32.13581597679176
Music?	32.13581597679176
No: it’s what’s behind.	18.49076096151689
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.	5.039775617670823
Bloom.	7.724644464000979
Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading.	8.086475087204875
Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her.	3.192890890378921
Tup.	22.281730317965827
Pores to dilate dilating.	8.55639188197318
Tup.	22.281730317965827
The joy the feel the warm the.	9.731787355095092
Tup.	22.281730317965827
To pour o’er sluices pouring gushes.	7.824701411199908
Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob.	4.688824754206254
Now! Language of love.	7.7308377035684
—...	2.4299861334617914
_ray of hope is_...	3.3956065448979023
Beaming.	32.13581597679176
Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.	3.949071963367298
_Martha_ it is.	5.567660174041145
Coincidence.	22.281730317965827
Just going to write.	12.468554899091982
Lionel’s song.	24.801738414235864
Can’t write.	20.361304808723073
Accept my little pres.	12.53974648026969
Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too.	6.421407381886594
She’s a.	23.684633742266634
I called you naughty boy.	5.8059001785791144
Still the name: Martha.	25.43125381776897
How strange! Today.	6.791212737248195
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.	8.925951549845529
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.	8.605615670740729
Wish I could see his face, though.	15.924396057174148
Explain better.	8.732813016406928
Why the barber in Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.	13.563211736164124
Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.	12.253618150110063
—_Each graceful look_...	2.615771504720943
First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure.	10.288275021273886
Yellow, black lace she wore.	11.93585552671273
Musical chairs.	13.943843522115227
We two the last.	13.032076633019852
Fate.	20.244295502353957
After her.	5.297514951622471
Fate.	20.244295502353957
Round and round slow.	12.609796690788638
Quick round.	10.19448965235056
We two.	15.013425838474285
All looked.	10.19448965235056
Halt.	32.13581597679176
Down she sat.	14.786396833216765
All ousted looked.	7.554588130286805
Lips laughing.	8.572509804002673
Yellow knees.	9.573690248878348

But Bloom sang dumb.	10.82639741088797
Admiring.	32.13581597679176
Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice.	10.596146616938935
He remembered one night long ago.	9.577116132284244
Never forget that night.	7.680848423182288
Si sang _’Twas rank and fame_: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas.	9.77796781813457

At Passage was his body laid.	15.165511627278828
By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.	13.247147319427517
Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard.	11.116834216876407
You who hear in peace.	5.745728365693943
Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people.	7.975330801059924

He murmured that he knew the name.	13.826912952197311
The name was familiar to him, that is to say.	3.8519523120680113
That was to say he had heard the name of.	34.102665895551766
Dollard, was it?	12.507518794337205
Dollard, yes.	12.333493341165106

at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye.	12.913607479248975
I turned around to let him have the weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter only Joe Hynes.	11.570427196850094
—Lo, Joe, says I.	6.741292753036917
How are you blowing?	19.993557987898747
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	11.735343903952828
—Soot’s luck, says Joe.	11.78668620908417
Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?	22.59895120073042
—Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	28.115769367505028
I’m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	13.25627383272514
—What are you doing round those parts?	12.623902497646544
—Devil a much, says I.	10.238773268638827
There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	10.217969400663494
—Circumcised?	16.58211792698403
—Ay, says I.	6.570652367110804
A bit off the top.	35.6518181952541
An old plumber named Geraghty.	10.727138689141
I’m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a penny out of him.	12.675063045720242
—That the lay you’re on now?	15.190023751303382
—Ay, says I.	6.570652367110804
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	7.25736116556106
But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	16.17805191341556
_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst.	13.958480522245024
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	14.397470764045456
_He drink me my teas.	9.54325740212424
He eat me my sugars.	9.54325740212424
Because he no pay me my moneys?_ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	9.313664998049523
Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	9.251678123392338
—Are you a strict t.t.?	13.833099639070788
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	7.790820754261146
—What about paying our respects to our friend?	12.683294782617798
—Who?	8.672134463555837
says I.	6.567119036681071
Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.	25.552377096410883
—Drinking his own stuff?	15.538703044992406
—Ay, says I.	6.570652367110804
Whisky and water on the brain.	27.127126501436152
I want to see the citizen.	13.83126351192744
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I.	15.880545479526672
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	7.813930189073901
—Not a word, says Joe.	10.482487745773494
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	24.658129351785117
—What was that, Joe?	25.935748168912987
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	7.528571178434049
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	10.350324520225808
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	15.074278555824254
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	15.70884194762902
Jesus, I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	18.367871041048645
For trading without a licence, says he.	6.33821791777397
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	11.168581612507865
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	7.630665624492241
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	8.016973023707815
A pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated.	15.684291984948597
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	14.599429311094474
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	7.18504656193379
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	11.580292549930528
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	7.308818474059236
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	4.464504498741892
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	9.596484650517382
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	19.758828791599413
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	19.423251362007072
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	14.899857961255613
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	22.363373177020087
—Stand and deliver, says he.	6.364568995288642
—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.	7.420012738640501
Friends here.	5.839984039894037
—Pass, friends, says he.	6.031951555906033
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: —What’s your opinion of the times?	20.288578105981525
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	12.924433689713556
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	18.6098544040622
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	20.77698256489601
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: —Foreign wars is the cause of it.	14.828168998190243
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: —It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	15.731493175529575
—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.	6.858369114757937
I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.	9.878093951979281
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	13.0122894630753
—Wine of the country, says he.	9.882657342377552
—What’s yours?	25.281421811780014
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	5.802564470299337
And how’s the old heart, citizen?	23.276954798996403
says he.	6.2246949987246945
—Never better, _a chara_, says he.	5.492343261281814
What Garry?	13.943843522115227
Are we going to win?	12.00780182168249
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	25.84662124397947
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	7.218791622466704
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	7.70258013039002
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	8.321236701779055
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	26.12462269058898
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	10.358313035375996
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	9.400440298542835
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	5.7223945472362505
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	8.61782047198547
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	5.024793282858948

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	6.459455874044117
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	9.54782770902205
O, as true as I’m telling you.	15.632297353737654
A goodlooking sovereign.	9.70564496856689
—And there’s more where that came from, says he.	15.00953070923537
—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	7.524334045878036
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	8.029667849968773
’Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	14.520362322037945
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	17.427393090320926
Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour?	10.248107797214367
O’Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	23.94594039930052
Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the prudent soul.	15.138188995199386
—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	17.31800301955898
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	8.466638753155337
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	7.914060873219989
Look at this, says he.	14.942985827418266
_The Irish Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend.	11.718885482649565
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.	26.649535843745863
And he starts reading them out: —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	11.541998756373784
How’s that, eh?	11.821120838156954
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	7.644747147174262

Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	9.156918037336002
How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	21.590443138934706
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	15.562856849602705
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	10.489742051510879
Drink that, citizen.	8.465689082053935
—I will, says he, honourable person.	12.808524661891408
—Health, Joe, says I.	5.762544899817324
And all down the form.	28.748052263837426
Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	17.447964597084024
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	20.58720104045698
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	10.989147252767985
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	10.448903118543086
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	13.369000217807177
I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	13.363782634537854
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	12.591580095077124
I thought Alf would split.	12.743027767276262
—Look at him, says he.	6.623379143951816
Breen.	25.50621404370786
He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	18.116919851197743
p: up on it to take a li...	14.144104404324063
And he doubled up.	11.701081121428999
—Take a what?	8.60452309375277
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	9.173895782441742
—O hell! says I.	16.197801150722956
The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	19.00432215956385
—Who?	8.672134463555837
—Breen, says Alf.	8.452745604554618
He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark.	21.22919949181091
O God, I’ve a pain laughing.	8.900331923550615
U.	12.75310702185393
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	13.873203298120657
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	15.362790706541631
—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.	8.710845024130743
Is that Alf Bergan?	23.035711878861356
—Yes, says Alf.	6.701491915447005
Hanging?	32.13581597679176
Wait till I show you.	5.157711015881923
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	17.956579500367038
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	8.576611625121824
You should have seen long John’s eye.	13.642991069585454
U.	12.75310702185393
p ....	4.305813827264469
And he started laughing.	12.415960675974466
—Who are you laughing at?	9.582273483836696
says Bob Doran.	7.894480764932054
Is that Bergan?	21.283548931285555
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	10.386103904079993
Terence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup full of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and Bungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of deathless Leda.	10.24380962692681
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	8.736397976331057
But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	10.512167909406882
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	16.926708359542324
—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	12.649702843374511
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	12.092014433750258
Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw.	11.195759612197074
Hangmen’s letters.	28.120452060064206
Look at here.	6.8411582062025245
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	13.814817773761407
—Are you codding?	20.314677574689608
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Honest injun, says Alf.	5.113842812995948
Read them.	5.354180925719555
So Joe took up the letters.	11.09936794285806
—Who are you laughing at?	9.582273483836696
says Bob Doran.	7.894480764932054
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	22.391719461194924
Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk: —How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	26.72224736893795
—I don’t know, says Alf.	11.327949370804681
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	15.166680102551018
Only I was running after that...	10.471513671635183
—You what?	16.09429954543165
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	16.54943077920914
With who?	11.725328032605423
—With Dignam, says Alf.	11.20837822163319
—Is it Paddy?	19.324622764172904
—Yes, says Alf.	6.701491915447005
Why?	12.497976142926124
—Don’t you know he’s dead?	9.97581256538215
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	8.307317577693997
—Ay, says Joe.	4.298128098875627
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	14.315904030463246
—Who’s dead?	15.19629500120287
says Bob Doran.	7.894480764932054
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	15.506156468792302
Good Christ, only five...	10.234157969428182
What?...	3.1855253369858803
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s...	12.35416714218597
Dignam dead?	15.782923272247585
—What about Dignam?	28.267602338756152
says Bob Doran.	7.894480764932054
Who’s talking about...?	28.543124433490846
—Dead! says Alf.	5.152943969765715
He’s no more dead than you are.	13.476231196143049
—Maybe so, says Joe.	4.820755969176842
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	8.429117779307969
—Paddy?	17.932863081398303
—Ay, says Joe.	4.298128098875627
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	1.9389713349935738
—Good Christ! says Alf.	6.151757519862532
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	10.45975966155032
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	9.393672742035585
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	12.538717008326257
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	15.7569994256587
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	7.612443318291023
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	5.414426086331542
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power.	10.416362020219449
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	22.10195604352853
Mind C.	6.817466119191894
K.	13.667053076115803
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	13.054146943109215
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	23.89013164029435
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	17.849809186823524
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	10.11618246356657
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	16.039927583586227
He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning.	15.788594664598177
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	16.306452346467175
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	17.688106971209677
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	7.713969155422064
—Who?	8.672134463555837
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Bloom, says he.	7.157884630810299
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	14.34727521369401
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	10.688941753661972
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	11.675914154005923
Faith, he was.	16.244164753214207
—Good Christ! says he.	8.538673146076608
I could have sworn it was him.	8.367526442158859
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence: —Who said Christ is good?	20.77846629742756
—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.	8.880812441998074
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	15.852403268230086
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	13.03783720848064
He’s over all his troubles.	28.137400294169208
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	5.563810469642844
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	13.157014632719779
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	17.825058462745016
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.	8.028352598593434
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	15.060121824097898
The tear is bloody near your eye.	3.601257944704936
Talking through his bloody hat.	10.428534630057705
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	16.60574753410375
—The noblest, the truest, says he.	12.042377900382847
And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	12.912200012926547
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven.	8.818350019508493
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	9.384318068673005
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.	17.212153521136123
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	12.098643693512907
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	17.735623466203368
Listen to this, will you?	9.726733145510854
And he starts reading out one.	8.010969038027321
—_...	2.200628112064386
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._ —Jesus, says I.	4.366489838294551
—_...	2.200628112064386
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	12.429416954049708
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees._ _H.	10.949096714266933
Rumbold, Master Barber._ —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	10.782201185828544
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	14.946433947190464
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	24.411343108813607
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	18.79805011891305
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar.	15.850657619192422
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.	10.996866327031382
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	6.012886196368831
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	12.668491856033095
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	10.116114052252222
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	21.343662434134636
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	6.705001182241567
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	11.95826611572002
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	10.437176348668356
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.	16.75000783660085
—That so?	9.445642156049578
—God’s truth, says Alf.	16.76086927520003
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	22.072699292940246
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	9.22936140618841
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	11.409585483592696
It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...	8.931527424239336
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	16.01147470583707
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	19.727734192999296
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	6.905654280691341
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	16.685769089679134
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	10.592227368225883
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring.	15.863121384931558
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	18.264111163720433
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	10.601931957895907
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	13.213019758587478
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	23.144381906347736
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	17.764789552457923
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel.	20.20014753250434
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	10.45786663588458
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but on the other hand_.	15.922256566177646
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	18.22141093819406
Phenomenon! —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	13.15538500482219
—Ay, ay, says Joe.	5.543716522555191
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.	8.09000694660923
What I mean is...	8.63954788519178
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	8.416070294825325
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	12.87532265703288
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	10.801261910249915
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	6.5331924564210615
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	11.295697649897606
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.	8.494718338185036
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	8.462096945177402
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.	5.412647380689523
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	8.609072464577975
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	8.47337513414958
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	8.860977487448658
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	2.934218596442721
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	9.6255644537939
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	7.031073114972666
E.	10.582866589593744
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint.	13.916860461114686
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	5.361917001743268
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	5.2822277359912
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	16.142577059085657
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	7.693983900860409
E.	10.582866589593744
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	17.21054678720651
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	12.305656790670154
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	9.144401403485059
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	9.585298883701025
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	6.858247678946136
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	7.163115834921842
It was exactly seventeen o’clock.	9.686199635978566
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	13.302106748947255
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	11.33384232290607
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	6.204555179038691
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	7.953553085029644
The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficent institution.	8.563289470162237
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	10.232682036145775
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	10.485480842736491
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	8.102368195816549
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	10.82266064281848
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	11.668421840230753
She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed heartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in the general merriment.	15.570749657676478
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	4.154716111572848
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	8.519768903342655
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	9.30278873223865
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	16.18061109088588
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	10.411165828013852
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	11.541419893656917
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	11.081011820047989
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	12.061758513123877
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	13.099450785394714
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	17.272585417082162
Antitreating is about the size of it.	8.541915790651386
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint.	18.27817233218106
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking.	10.373160333547014
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	5.483102864076354
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	13.670083559371397
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	8.376036445720594
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	11.549223292112908
I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	17.565219579111698
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him.	8.230419859857282
—Afraid he’ll bite you?	9.112267498972614
says the citizen, jeering.	11.678846983063726
—No, says I.	8.545489960745524
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	32.61803938459059
So he calls the old dog over.	15.966525920341997
—What’s on you, Garry?	19.084830175989772
says he.	6.2246949987246945
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	11.072610333482062
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	9.289935533124275
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	21.289545270738774
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	9.679401552632116
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	10.453553662582564
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	6.837009060081198
We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D.	9.67608772605832
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	13.193783066219815
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	7.775420167678635
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	9.502227951516153
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	8.58847148342178
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry’s lights.	7.286623649014902
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	18.860089484202007
And Joe asked him would he have another.	9.858820920872597
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.	14.070554379227232
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.	23.93290051942887
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	16.866531952279562
And says Joe: —Could you make a hole in another pint?	26.7595697286902
—Could a swim duck?	8.665330132049261
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Same again, Terry, says Joe.	6.491188504672581
Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	18.521425309848908
says he.	6.2246949987246945
—Thank you, no, says Bloom.	10.757805979402823
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.	8.149833350813221
Martin asked me to go to the house.	15.029832042208712
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.	22.674537990424145
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	8.374365961089394
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	11.21838273075791
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.	23.259038445130805
—Whose admirers?	16.92538249648606
—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	10.985550167179134
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	18.237504007663375
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	14.090617800807026
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	6.991276649275166
True as you’re there.	5.8233134503778965
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	12.651158658741265
So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.	13.749354827188276
Choking with bloody foolery.	10.82639741088797
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	8.186797586453942
Shake hands, brother.	20.321001957750823
You’re a rogue and I’m another.	11.28585572262761
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	16.74200545551305
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	13.844086002180276
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	19.874140642944443
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	11.006420174072488
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	25.976752852173288
Boosed at five o’clock.	5.172579723034724
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A.	11.422725554548501
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	14.774655575325491
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	15.178839362066592
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	22.060409908965845
_How is your testament?	13.042044000554291
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	22.043267253671452
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	23.875328423193196
Jack Mooney’s sister.	18.187084714110906
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	17.743939039534254
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	14.794481227636998
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.	8.415430030690354
So Terry brought the three pints.	11.338322672365633
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	14.711083598185288
Here, citizen.	14.511929607807525
—_Slan leat_, says he.	4.1852846328583775
—Fortune, Joe, says I.	6.3555164899239776
Good health, citizen.	7.89550180480481
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	14.518724511481
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	19.430778408393863
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	14.935324952751651
—Friend of yours, says Alf.	10.241439695230543
—Nannan?	23.60097507926347
The mimber?	16.58211792698403
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.	8.426312732493487
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	9.77424822212712
P., the cattle traders.	42.053172645226546
—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of all countries and the idol of his own.	12.664225081496166
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	13.717658251180948
Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard.	41.31533544490773
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	15.828634220399652
Mister Knowall.	16.58211792698403
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	10.806855865149426
Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	6.748825150739473
What’s your programme today?	15.945054301801596
Ay. Humane methods.	11.973430566688942
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	11.746184284228168
Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen.	20.779758146603236
Ga Ga Gara.	8.4492546945381
She lays eggs for us.	5.606908811726855
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	11.54991926403917
Gara.	20.244295502353957
Then comes good uncle Leo.	6.053836374621549
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	11.986464086869344
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	8.69702659900256
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	8.957528200752296
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	23.735498567263367
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	20.747159662656593
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	15.731982786270395
—That’s too bad, says Bloom.	9.13029007722811
I wanted particularly.	24.468378765106014
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	7.746571544107882
I couldn’t phone.	15.000244681193417
No. You’re sure?	34.523429243767715
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.	11.560787886506581
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	9.113188078460626
What do you think of that, citizen?	13.016692986262505
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.	6.987966245858495
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8.033053861831862
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	9.649933334716547
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	12.116599241714928
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	15.94774499045714
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	8.002045384160631
The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.	35.44504592310221
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.	10.604692146654326
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	9.973902685797743
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	23.34630404808626
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	10.167834470715919
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	19.418885852748588
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	8.55639188197318
Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.	12.026343049508368
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	8.866207793230265
Cheers.) —There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	21.006276056987335
There he is sitting there.	13.358721544010464
The man that got away James Stephens.	7.748664174977107
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	6.926727540189819
What was your best throw, citizen?	12.537212310842836
—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	8.903525979279777
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	25.141452020750673
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	8.300146269171623
You were and a bloody sight better.	20.836348623316805
—Is that really a fact?	11.371660157209439
—Yes, says Bloom.	5.263571098317217
That’s well known.	20.78400293160819
Did you not know that?	27.952755238028406
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	8.652797994578764
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad.	14.52472351900607
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	20.54300441209184
Do you see that straw?	19.57349177422825
That’s a straw_.	21.23361221359963
Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	27.876076561704785
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	9.130370791159457
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	16.496561172376122
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	12.90672736722296
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	9.364602716222079
L.	10.990294469428525
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	8.819915987977357
The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	9.242701688098656
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	11.49241424824182
The proceedings then terminated.	8.55639188197318

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?	9.553228374382723
—No, says Joe.	5.589948831076325
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	13.19683870046625
—Who?	8.672134463555837
Blazes?	32.13581597679176
And says Bloom: —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	13.58352183812808
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	9.98595678674093
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	16.575218790470664
—We know him, says the citizen.	13.4110279887522
The traitor’s son.	8.870015585463426
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	10.785039934919936
—True for you, says Joe.	4.849046248015272
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: —Now, don’t you think, Bergan?	12.754364719675682
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	7.579466017095754
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	9.055597034222293
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	19.29130537593975
See the little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping.	17.847821868426504
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	20.229499577104466
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	10.956042633099713
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	7.707993866286841
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	12.64103242689745
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw.	15.239806538498874
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	12.332847944706163
The men came to handigrips.	15.80066306004753
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	8.704733957718597
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	14.628363386582992
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	4.336636688427425
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	6.257332167668711
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat.	10.672799841206078
It was a knockout clean and clever.	15.265744878530873
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	8.376436633969998
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	4.538952288970053
I hear he’s running a concert tour now up in the north.	16.537354372862175
—He is, says Joe.	7.741372753842652
—Who?	8.672134463555837
says Bloom.	4.450426075677159
That’s quite true.	14.479814716574214
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	17.660418069231802
Just a holiday.	23.347709325769163
—Mrs B.	6.649150360016203
is the bright particular star, isn’t she?	11.530611272066029
—My wife?	22.487119061874747
says Bloom.	4.450426075677159
She’s singing, yes.	18.062220164722596
I think it will be a success too.	14.19140054434638
Excellent.	32.13581597679176
Hoho begob says I to myself says I.	6.876207033709641
That explains the milk in the cocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest.	22.5859743520807
Blazes doing the tootle on the flute.	19.269891694095676
Concert tour.	16.58211792698403
Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island bridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight the Boers.	9.718917388434614
Old Whatwhat.	16.58211792698403
I called about the poor and water rate, Mr Boylan.	18.965974486940496
You what?	6.867516959895761
The water rate, Mr Boylan.	9.53342649564785
That’s the bucko that’ll organise her, take my tip.	25.360280288109827
’Twixt me and you Caddareesh.	18.23587386800051
Pride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy.	16.383520083391442
There grew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air.	3.491733504613627
The gardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.	7.776935141323043
The chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.	12.877169802335047
And lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned in the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert.	17.43291073611783
—Hello, Alf.	10.87933598390746
—Hello, Jack.	9.38078264490588
—Hello, Joe.	17.55810264510687
—God save you, says the citizen.	9.107776355106358
—Save you kindly, says J.	4.664375058192459
What’ll it be, Ned?	53.54920436611034
—Half one, says Ned.	8.511068697115297
So J.	4.8410100563896545
ordered the drinks.	9.70564496856689
—Yes, says J.	5.462267723523727
He’ll square that, Ned, says he.	13.197797815926299
—Hope so, says Ned.	6.781714775907865
Now what were those two at?	11.825599738679374
getting him off the grand jury list and the other give him a leg over the stile.	20.77061192389591
With his name in Stubbs’s.	9.914628783316187
Playing cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their eye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.	6.83894303979098
Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop.	13.314306528827714
Dunne, says he.	5.125890577311296
Ay, and done says I.	14.934474972687658
Gob, he’ll come home by weeping cross one of those days, I’m thinking.	13.416488714563597
—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there?	8.005405535862414
U.	12.75310702185393
—Yes, says J.	5.462267723523727
Looking for a private detective.	34.593015004337666
—Ay, says Ned.	6.348609839330494
And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first.	12.548317059432577
—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing.	9.026499954475838
God, I’d give anything to hear him before a judge and jury.	14.024846140041443
—Was it you did it, Alf?	31.785312327655824
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	18.470011164400105
—Me?	15.079680280383519
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	9.157214327425715
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	9.206632204923462
—Of course an action would lie, says J.	8.801546020103032
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	14.60597394112188
U.	12.75310702185393
_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	10.059986941174158
Do you know that he’s balmy?	37.634687220495714
Look at his head.	15.605212864252172
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	22.66954792410678
—Yes, says J.	5.462267723523727
J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.	16.703492530800002
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	9.565400726564404
—Pity about her, says the citizen.	9.529058776931857
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	12.5904015671094
—How half and half?	21.296271377613195
says Bloom.	4.450426075677159
Do you mean he...	6.255090634098201
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	7.791378005579909
A fellow that’s neither fish nor flesh.	13.570311318675921
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.	4.1181291609590325
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.	12.244328953358966
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	8.037403197931651
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	10.58307979239975
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	21.90495790631863
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	14.01992956998168
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the pope.	22.78149849524819
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	15.907873849784208
And who was he, tell us?	39.94083000306794
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	12.504427774135369
—And moreover, says J.	8.537744027201965
J., a postcard is publication.	36.91907051645354
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	14.935285142724696
Hole.	32.13581597679176
In my opinion an action might lie.	7.986622177812201
Six and eightpence, please.	8.016708110887926
Who wants your opinion?	14.034131292957143
Let us drink our pints in peace.	8.251568987868483
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.	14.919121739874974
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	14.833772393262487
—Good health, Ned, says J.	9.913256937760261
—-There he is again, says Joe.	4.83381147109235
—Where?	22.44460853839861
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	13.795343609673486
—How did that Canada swindle case go off?	13.65772767438459
—Remanded, says J.	4.678578411078854
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	10.570144102025049
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	23.57434561614773
Course it was a bloody barney.	27.049882317004695
Swindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too.	13.474359129878323
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	18.08136603762604
—Who tried the case?	25.782593892639056
—Recorder, says Ned.	6.40758118875489
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	15.03838483105787
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	8.4436029387929
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	15.516610263047042
—Ay, says Alf.	5.687179661535435
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	12.720011346496817
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: —A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	16.94653541576507
Ten, did you say?	13.617066661922083
—Yes, your worship.	21.84215272462379
And my wife has the typhoid.	24.276440602442158
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	7.471515880558617
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.	11.323468788493795
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	16.87894632540342
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	19.732806387240508
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	10.794641448092822
And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	20.009034561301814
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	10.581950685633144
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	11.591849427897115
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	14.759664269890282
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	7.108725731934099
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	11.06656634312632
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	10.596646445946526
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	17.95234323918712
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.	16.77454404861069
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	24.12748684905103
That’s the whole secret.	21.828456814112478
—Rely on me, says Joe.	11.106599264069711
We want no more strangers in our house.	9.558726750478176
—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom.	12.563194761151532
It’s just that Keyes, you see.	10.572416818198413
—Consider that done, says Joe.	5.942929536607641
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.	11.17690123982884
—The strangers, says the citizen.	10.457927921788341
Our own fault.	11.869655286702958
We let them come in.	7.684517127952264
We brought them in.	8.428191499071513
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	7.667758035450947
—Decree _nisi,_ says J.	5.128415406804402
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	20.621086573211297
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	16.992541961933984
—Give us a squint at her, says I.	8.762532366528685
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher.	14.114777526738727
Secrets for enlarging your private parts.	6.14633179370776
Misconduct of society belle.	10.82639741088797
Norman W.	6.2035035598878085
Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.	4.249595004323197
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W.	9.35753451182764
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! —There’s hair, Joe, says I.	9.865150831512857
Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off of that one, what?	13.178728466472108
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	14.663437809011484
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?	14.541114983605341
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	12.789314924419056
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	13.277755270517307
—It’s on the march, says the citizen.	12.891449015432979
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their _patois._ So J.	10.81344433308043
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	10.337149762287792
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	6.555807279763538
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	12.957042831363193
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	5.3725489418751895
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.	8.945835852001062
—The European family, says J.	9.076689309211053
J....	6.950962710628201
—They’re not European, says the citizen.	6.446272449728775
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	8.613662332847802
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._ And says John Wyse: —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	11.52789790922682
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: —_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	12.175608061437751
—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan.	19.926968616886242
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	25.939039853605845
—Gold cup, says he.	8.444153242908131
—Who won, Mr Lenehan?	31.224731117868217
says Terry.	9.884235987460922
_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one.	11.217478098964103
A rank outsider.	14.786396833216765
And the rest nowhere.	28.70039270842526
—And Bass’s mare?	33.37707358562863
says Terry.	9.884235987460922
—Still running, says he.	6.481679160181766
We’re all in a cart.	15.483057510183729
Boylan plunged two quid on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.	14.169023084622214
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn gave me.	19.045553245442843
Lord Howard de Walden’s.	3.5470103958848545
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan.	12.90344050778212
Such is life in an outhouse.	17.599128643655146
_Throwaway,_ says he.	4.413875001183944
Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.	19.944549617985842
Frailty, thy name is _Sceptre._ So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up.	16.568684167558626
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.	12.884071241916503
—Not there, my child, says he.	15.846696570859956
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.	5.774631844141808
She’d have won the money only for the other dog.	20.74420550079558
And J.	5.52737264232801
and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.	12.03412833452772
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own.	11.710361163505226
—_Raimeis_, says the citizen.	5.456689020762834
There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means.	16.005210712689884
Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?	15.37051439625949
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	9.723523623122755
Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?	13.311738248445122
Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.	7.352738743330728
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters.	9.11543770582383
What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?	9.471410676463002
And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?	13.863711458018136
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.	8.902632154477287
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.	12.820019584480566
I was reading a report of lord Castletown’s...	8.725283911885285
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	11.221873410196773
Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.	15.728235188485122
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.	8.044419321301099
The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	7.070874416810848
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	6.855603983717014
The bride who was given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	9.822802535994127
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	9.92542231918357
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	4.493907130072392
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	9.44387166381628
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	12.422556059157866
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	13.02849200021866
—And will again, says Joe.	7.083481278120105
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	21.560544040704663
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	11.183684161741446
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	14.072210746340511
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	29.664517128178815
Moya.	32.13581597679176
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	11.671669674693662
Cows in Connacht have long horns.	5.357668566267958
As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.	14.634405441178567
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	7.459463622773997
What will you have?	18.577654550103674
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	11.82447642821019
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	10.217582077382204
Terry! Are you asleep?	14.166229034910451
—Yes, sir, says Terry.	9.034563902498038
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	7.582886091984425
Right, sir.	5.7208361520598405
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	15.487231331216973
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.	16.86730800744439
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	5.395354581678731
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.	11.367322965746368
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	20.66282380917794
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	13.722632039416691
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	9.212627070278137
Hell upon earth it is.	5.276996064270987
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	10.516832466919531
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	6.209623188177851
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	14.647030053799778
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	16.318043173134818
And says John Wyse: —’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	13.170967821565677
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	18.842796228384596
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	9.372106782358877
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	18.177417023947207
That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	8.297862035954887
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	9.901412151622267
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	16.53034517039178
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	3.538326993134763
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	8.981115924798907
I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force?	17.7017685206575
Didn’t I tell you?	9.11162960611669
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.	9.670571517456978
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.	7.753321306527098
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	7.722625813226052
They were driven out of house and home in the black 47.	14.07874360180824
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	7.613219895020915
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	9.810161919996313
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	10.713527564574086
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	23.336213752637352
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	26.49288339617549
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	23.218707045720873
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	16.640978922606283
—Perfectly true, says Bloom.	5.808211804949518
But my point was...	5.5675221900608305
—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned.	19.054791409340197
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	15.519973299027818
—Ay, says John Wyse.	6.747050035220609
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	10.147048305201036
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	18.595407092114346
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	10.678533967254667
Fontenoy, eh?	5.61328856285742
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	7.922247734429197
But what did we ever get for it?	12.70334526077903
—The French! says the citizen.	10.048282641767573
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	10.226009447555573
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	10.346118834784827
Aren’t they trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion?	11.582548684494306
—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	8.363366865403613
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?	14.338525734701454
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	14.046466259058992
—Well, says J.	4.674600629662146
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	7.50230886437301
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	13.382446676089799
There’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	8.65004160826812
Edward Guelph-Wettin! —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	11.287683990504952
The earl of Dublin, no less.	21.427146865835535
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	16.0010361141986
And says J.	8.305111363869095
J.: —Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.	15.095683474289102
—Will you try another, citizen?	14.315106413112758
—Yes, sir, says he.	4.966638982242802
I will.	14.145629011262553
—You?	53.275171867240395
May your shadow never grow less.	6.16599936056265
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.	3.7595741054536775
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	13.10675011499454
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	10.00133460264643
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	7.082569710069092
—But do you know what a nation means?	34.25582191360421
—Yes, says Bloom.	5.263571098317217
—A nation?	38.56052964580414
says Bloom.	4.450426075677159
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	16.59838592026924
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years.	20.58253301628598
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: —Or also living in different places.	15.120449648234638
—That covers my case, says Joe.	8.397627104070038
—What is your nation if I may ask?	16.705032945561364
I was born here.	13.360040880192098
Ireland.	13.667053076115803
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	12.278591866185902
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	9.909501731155812
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	5.825025285441764
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	15.906674627466437
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	6.051621772421809
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	12.865409860768466
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	8.049179931664407
Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney, the ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins, Ireland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery of Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh’s banks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick Dun’s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch’s castle, the Scotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail, Castleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice, Jury’s Hotel, S.	9.628239865833413
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	13.613303003341853
—Show us over the drink, says I.	15.94048369006223
Which is which?	12.872306092276881
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	23.969883247935304
—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.	22.803397684718956
Also now.	5.230698116280242
This very instant.	10.333135095970073
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	24.023047693185237
—Robbed, says he.	4.565183974537502
Plundered.	32.13581597679176
Insulted.	32.13581597679176
Persecuted.	32.13581597679176
Taking what belongs to us by right.	9.114528479170154
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	11.094268664578868
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	30.060196038060393
—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	7.423435255278216
—Right, says John Wyse.	7.723526302071231
Stand up to it then with force like men.	15.439854299588818
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	17.999420268805498
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	17.846151286092766
Gob, he’d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him.	11.541630661275173
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	18.16716709302787
—But it’s no use, says he.	13.827040127294412
Force, hatred, history, all that.	7.1397862621381565
That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	13.280009667101183
And everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.	17.89477077331972
—Love, says Bloom.	8.6646559224618
I mean the opposite of hatred.	22.304692245730703
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	19.05942908502449
If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second.	19.225042328843926
Just a moment.	8.115862258608747
Who’s hindering you?	13.897241907851816
And off he pops like greased lightning.	6.439517246972131
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	12.124377116279096
Universal love.	8.166345857871713
—Well, says John Wyse.	6.796796254134253
Isn’t that what we’re told.	18.04056974924318
Love your neighbour.	9.70564496856689
—That chap?	42.80904775044904
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	11.46344052495901
Love, moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	14.183834946244334
Love loves to love love.	6.958214475159568
Nurse loves the new chemist.	16.088904294620278
Constable 14A loves Mary Kelly.	8.747943063179333
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	24.80896443322732
M.	9.034798973650673
B.	10.122147751176978
loves a fair gentleman.	13.935439585883755
Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	4.688824754206254
Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant.	19.808317167452973
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	8.92575672197143
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	15.31547446905288
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	11.752426760510609
Mrs Norman W.	5.07724393020963
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	6.5220173728712325
You love a certain person.	13.78991391857071
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	6.659853006220417
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	14.64562907812217
More power, citizen.	8.238777529824626
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.	6.277965393891679
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.	8.350798298902413
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	14.346328271340974
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	14.191041415432412
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?	10.900296803119717
—What’s that?	9.356975705049678
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	8.400809145585598
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	11.30630012852096
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	8.560232379798743
—Widow woman, says Ned.	9.658785309610906
I wouldn’t doubt her.	7.0633165503940605
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	35.7065020275245
—Same only more so, says Lenehan.	6.597992582405012
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	6.624145443871969
—Is that by Griffith?	19.347046060074806
—No, says the citizen.	6.812053920411537
It’s not signed Shanganagh.	15.960881547556676
It’s only initialled: P.	8.059165186458998
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.	10.346137890380993
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen.	14.4734519927621
Trade follows the flag.	10.794662732664037
—Well, says J.	4.674600629662146
J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	18.49978984496665
Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?	16.24189196149065
—Casement, says the citizen.	5.456689020762834
He’s an Irishman.	29.293561804390464
—Yes, that’s the man, says J.	8.605722857268601
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	16.887454335776162
—Who?	8.672134463555837
says I.	6.567119036681071
—Bloom, says he.	7.157884630810299
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	16.781904234617905
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	16.11603447742872
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan.	15.152593640247307
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	18.817450587277868
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	12.518932121709412
He’s the only man in Dublin has it.	9.199098511609693
A dark horse.	15.531950657884844
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	8.342894414720524
—Mind, Joe, says I.	7.266763734520532
Show us the entrance out.	11.575091860786445
—There you are, says Terry.	15.99541193361409
Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort.	9.924203248506629
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	13.896901939434374
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	11.840956272228045
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	11.003389289432054
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	13.267106653505039
Give us a bloody chance.	19.0141472388984
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	24.688896710231454
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	22.23199198157857
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	16.250900324041723
Distance no object.	12.872306092276881
No security.	16.58211792698403
Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one.	17.356089220191812
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse.	8.486616455148013
And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	18.779146623576832
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense.	15.381561551661328
Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.	7.408734375991648
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	16.070390995620905
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	18.27040897514224
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	17.610410000170297
Look to our steeds.	20.04451395463994
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	5.754472793555277
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	14.635140146010462
I know not what to offer your lordships.	14.130464518118183
—How now, fellow?	22.116181802258176
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.	10.839686148685285
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	11.550301961083264
An you be the king’s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	14.32609254159975
The king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	10.101622815354919
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	15.232044296979536
Hast aught to give us?	15.028602836900554
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	14.125376627232981
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	14.405010448017913
That likes me well.	7.144484492770881
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.	13.55299855300525
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	6.541024909215833
says Lenehan.	8.591725167836444
Defrauding widows and orphans.	8.55639188197318
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	21.48013200747193
Or so they allege.	13.400741213227459
—Who made those allegations?	13.91488330140398
—I, says Joe.	20.367862510925054
I’m the alligator.	15.70364102370507
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	16.881128426187022
—Why not?	12.757196148972248
says J.	4.8311915053179675
J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.	11.688801543328736
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	19.268900221902406
says Ned.	7.590082878524985
Or who is he?	9.867595873326556
No offence, Crofton.	10.82639741088797
—Who is Junius?	20.818759990347147
says J.	4.8311915053179675
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	12.848520811089406
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	16.445531350859138
We know that in the castle.	33.70708841373248
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	14.828102641390656
says Jack Power.	11.81304989254282
—Not at all, says Martin.	8.172838707290433
Only namesakes.	16.58211792698403
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	20.246424763438508
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	11.309101488399723
Island of saints and sages! —Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	11.624110384313221
For that matter so are we.	12.456719754167535
—Yes, says J.	5.462267723523727
J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah.	20.397797982665548
And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till he knows if he’s a father or a mother.	19.807979310364775
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	9.447491528459858
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	14.078939266085387
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	12.788045836984447
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J.	3.7701388006839593
—Do you call that a man?	42.54241045951891
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	14.222669976762859
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	13.531487281823928
—And who does he suspect?	26.340814029189715
Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest.	10.177733189694438
One of those mixed middlings he is.	6.827013926500187
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	12.133049599015642
Do you know what I’m telling you?	8.136752593469847
It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	26.11114767477119
Justifiable homicide, so it would.	8.980309517121734
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	12.108506327211456
Give us your blessing.	28.371232852479874
Not as much as would blind your eye.	5.115310327616785
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	14.132284469989484
But where is he?	8.698942427975496
We can’t wait.	13.433435409635193
—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen.	11.89546869385965
That’s what he is.	17.339414432531623
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	3.646565306244534
Cursed by God.	7.848950680459311
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	15.75947925540402
says Ned.	7.590082878524985
—Only one, says Martin.	13.670122545508299
We must be quick.	18.895073204277995
and S.	4.319510920992252

Crofton?	32.13581597679176
Three half ones, Terry.	11.485153868817797
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	9.67074989797829
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	8.959238422383619
—Amen, says the citizen.	6.509897901112458
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.	8.900270412104893
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	6.825651151150172

Ursula with eleven thousand virgins.	5.627791510240851
And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	4.390584072555795
And as they wended their way by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	6.991162442913273
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	7.8409463411308025
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	9.44694433813222
And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessed answered his prayers.	14.231875479410366
—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._ —_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._ —_Dominus vobiscum._ —_Et cum spiritu tuo._ And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: —_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._ —And so say all of us, says Jack.	6.407068292366847
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	14.97547844785934
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	15.509580097381626
And butter for fish.	7.622878559556313
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	13.390726094956449
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	16.60802738570218
I hope I’m not...	8.015454627556494
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.	14.366126046930317
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	13.832869220850943
Mean bloody scut.	9.70564496856689
Stand us a drink itself.	16.490071953840022
Devil a sweet fear! There’s a jew for you! All for number one.	12.009472603884793
Cute as a shithouse rat.	15.362864577722524
Hundred to five.	8.200267164798879
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.	4.928925206361279
—Beg your pardon, says he.	6.750894740366888
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	24.469967488943958
Come along now.	8.437972724790658
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	4.450732776600964
It’s a secret.	25.631287909657477
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	24.33903217358135
—Bye bye all, says Martin.	7.085563323049455
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	25.3098346035299
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	18.341416832381782
The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard.	10.477559308572026
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	10.743675505946888
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	19.39508262771201
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	14.562708103731998
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	12.59017678255092
—Let me alone, says he.	13.51794787913565
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: —Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	13.1908209786776
Jesus, there’s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	10.686033272245103
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	15.761044146897284
And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew_ and a slut shouts out of her: —Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister! And says he: —Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza.	14.64402801960255
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	22.868331695482926
Your God.	11.992428326154721
—He had no father, says Martin.	20.21615610239668
That’ll do now.	12.608825153853545
Drive ahead.	11.725328032605423
—Whose God?	13.58670797861849
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	10.131790864361376
Your God was a jew.	11.203560880825753
Christ was a jew like me.	12.039220664505157
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	33.800207819341196
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	10.321027850941617
By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will.	10.282141564522888
Give us that biscuitbox here.	7.074343162974412
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.	11.070365529284773
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	6.724633644203421
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	13.140430892918914
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	16.14373759059314
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.	9.143867595181298
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	10.105290005065333
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not forgotten.	8.593338710751734
Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre: —Where is he till I murder him?	16.26957701954721
And Ned and J.	4.113484171719205
paralysed with the laughing.	13.482060678763858
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.	16.043748063106438
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him.	14.098104176148777
—Hold on, citizen, says Joe.	6.3618245492486665
Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	13.729334064209587
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.	17.15952500954663
The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.	13.700866352465034
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	6.944668191594808
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	12.843414871516623
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	8.326336260023576
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	11.89501332401674
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	5.847835800184608
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	11.947274011479278
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	6.87355207495673
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	10.347758233279194
The work of salvage, removal of _débris,_ human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs T.	6.7292530160530255

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	13.596003068955834
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	7.90338166893734
O, Jesus, he did.	25.413334433630048
And he let a volley of oaths after him.	9.183958731647003
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?	11.37721758062975
And he shouting to the bloody dog: —After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	23.104482761182997
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	15.016726522127982
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	15.002796954171856
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	10.561764249511466
[ 13 ] The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	8.95041035753519
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	12.334276766108944
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	15.653594348752119
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	12.14081248818329
M.	9.034798973650673
Belleisle_ printed on both.	15.087821183754789
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	4.755452894078854
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	12.383689414902662
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	6.963800043220979
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	15.889170790959772
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	8.798372895891015
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	5.719556004347356
Say out big, big.	15.215409636888209
I want a drink of water.	37.18904955440162
And baby prattled after her: —A jink a jink a jawbo.	10.774607280956706
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	11.176865881584844
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	14.148009323220515
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	9.579984513497825
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	15.466671445894875
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	11.155187557912592
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	15.129594454114265
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule.	13.173697778354953
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	11.242642102944718
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	11.98439814437135
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	12.641153837685692
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	20.485644285219337
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	15.60561957729583
Wait till I catch you for that.	7.392001802925057
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins.	11.360262976209189
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	23.673982379848418
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	12.362101515423483
—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	5.1755545363849516
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: —What’s your name?	13.369766201089403
Butter and cream?	16.92538249648606
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	20.172780213165645
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	7.809572720983046
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.	3.789610465280277
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	16.12042131015449
Cissy queried.	12.599684944605478
—Nao, Tommy said.	3.445516690520899
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.	26.063603681789665
Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart.	11.370940365286797
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	11.995072693181264
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.	17.1217251652715
But who was Gerty?	41.648003607052544
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	9.943397961327664
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	9.940932630744374
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid’s bow, Greekly perfect.	9.97549337069835
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	9.349342803508014
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again.	17.802510331644115
No. Honour where honour is due.	9.737841071122533
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	10.18969576953956
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	15.28910315781791
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	8.061948826630701
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	13.151843417810397
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	10.440933892661016
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	12.177600499411934
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	13.400568080983032
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	10.25865672297156
But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	9.439867386291182
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	17.25948256754542
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	10.63167245975257
And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	14.564394430727619
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	11.218265045315308
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	15.25195121982502
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	18.162724542555967
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	13.613392048941547
She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers’ quarrel.	14.068831748384039
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	13.434761158064413
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	19.796285916534558
E.	10.582866589593744
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	16.039573738300586
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	11.866578182914408
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	15.019332741002403
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	17.604683599953134
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	20.618033551908837
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	12.509574377979508
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	9.52008505754941
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	7.280406547744839
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	12.499199606460047
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	23.81499335125184
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	9.423103679152398
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	7.089715094344066
As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	10.145954204039915
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.	7.913348088278264
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday.	16.19705830601871
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	11.352700136516015
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	12.046518671056678
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	15.789432000135633
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	8.493650804307308
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	8.7421865196611
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	8.568836314508252
D.	10.582866589593744
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	10.512875668984362
He was too young to understand.	32.9949210090174
He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright.	42.21830362054936
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	15.705853907038014
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	18.641688659969724
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	11.744781020047096
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	12.810103429207278
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	9.616021309429888
It would be like heaven.	12.772309440775347
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	10.95624998870367
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	16.463929810515182
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	12.93628916549688
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	19.191227153536996
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	9.347184612831901
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	8.488670398965848
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	12.703561119172724
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	25.440671078962488
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	18.900008863141586
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	21.064475804582077
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	11.652969520925677
It’s my ball.	14.821133129599207
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	19.347268383724746
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	10.707877412695344
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	8.578923993567903
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.	7.738015403490078
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	11.321831878105824
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	10.663095626161285
—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	25.052471780026508
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.	6.790893290474476
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	11.110390286371926
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	14.164212127663376
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	15.884632582618789
That was just like Cissycums.	33.33080396859156
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	24.43348886742846
There was none to come up to her for fun.	27.404408307897896
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	15.303946228874779
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	29.477106010234994
It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S.	13.467129345889514
J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament.	13.064175665459837
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	12.946993520251075
How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.	7.492686381950041
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	14.400979658831956
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	5.653842673539089
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	14.342769461218941
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	8.357327314584214
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	9.87124191675379
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	19.28645824975047
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	10.650314113322883
Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	19.462066150893598
No-one would have thought the end was so near.	18.821034160561762
Now he was laid to rest.	18.47714403487316
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	9.553122223171183
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	12.48580102975667
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	8.921607179735572
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	32.01773316138923
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	11.78313865837553
You could see there was a story behind it.	15.988353250687851
The colours were done something lovely.	4.9130037374182915
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	28.22812042693569
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	13.866642922058922
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	9.887759164114124
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	10.478589119572963
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	10.15195730648494
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	17.191455663424247
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	13.725146980393584
—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	9.578177160334477
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	5.0965544461928545
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	10.24757301246866
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	10.821170050694402
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.	14.594267748732854
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	8.874092206077393
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	11.20547508819621
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	6.14301326471858
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	7.631800573358195
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	21.220150269439895
—Say papa, baby.	12.500972953170976
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	5.078462823347328
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	13.481170785908835
—Haja ja ja haja.	7.082569710069092
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	10.325853578360244
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	10.01594144819975
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	6.337099201584682
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	15.340641976285607
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	17.4789779301162
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	12.426728117359012
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	23.243615150366438
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	8.938163303228768
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	22.18356559954601
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul.	9.647347828625014
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	11.900418203037958
People were so queer.	14.752059185197528
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	17.80223069996396
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	11.563322899423246
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	18.466589097832262
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	17.570284182468573
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	27.69674656250624
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.	21.15887911751839
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	8.342395008364603
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	11.477831756145086
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	7.220336242563625
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	7.441903981169187
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	13.624081100401344
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	9.228588458234697
Refuge of sinners.	11.148858409578036
Comfortress of the afflicted.	51.796593864542906
_Ora pro nobis_.	13.29830072003241
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	10.351288184325592
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	19.479030721832252
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	16.92469812108823
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	18.175678953211975
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	15.509495131147741
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	11.51719759537744
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	8.665330132049261
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	18.509595884672834
—Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out.	10.391869893099267
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	17.657806533321114
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	14.638529656035074
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	11.839970758392973
_Tableau!_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	22.93896461964829
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	13.843964354322164
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	15.222890003243881
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	16.647625457993314
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness.	14.092592919538475
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	11.36727586310926
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	11.588635903400753
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	10.96924567344932
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	14.04574149219355
Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	14.828485006796322
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	11.712175722032345
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	14.737377678541039
And she said to Gerty: —A penny for your thoughts.	26.035931059650864
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	13.355054299281766
I was only wondering was it late.	17.49854773058165
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	13.115713490410746
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	17.94366689905753
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	22.12578066103726
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum.	15.874641925453494
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	20.160468415256627
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	17.594966590664992
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	16.205048455312305
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	20.482983750388264
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	13.24289825458542
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	16.828491547214753
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	22.26142160340147
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	16.262706390520755
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	10.85775304170169
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face.	17.188772766229743
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	27.985464096461232
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	12.920883781726323
Gerty winced sharply.	9.70564496856689
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	9.577245656768657
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	10.772023842056203
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	9.236023848900016
She had loved him better than he knew.	17.443846708662093
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	16.297899026451084
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	11.796996199880027
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	12.926957551241161
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.	12.139857765546484
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	11.34977950094769
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	28.21536850189129
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	13.749504303830436
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	14.535759671141282
—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	9.60755556556518
He has his bib destroyed.	19.917060873004814
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	6.552343020856388
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	13.128514803493044
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	14.673735517627033
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	10.356231463390325
For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of.	7.939742737423541
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	11.857907512849643
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	13.270960598767072
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	10.454269521797032
But it must end, she felt.	6.782231792918514
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	10.6840728556163
Love laughs at locksmiths.	8.55639188197318
She would make the great sacrifice.	30.77474588481207
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	8.363036642763984
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	6.15366869730908
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	20.122235774641265
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	8.79874759719016
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	14.112137118910336
No, no: not that.	15.750816689979223
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	20.915130258338582
She thought she understood.	15.655039814242365
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	16.736327165749298
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	11.004768945979864
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	28.977974311321184
Nothing else mattered.	11.148858409578036
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	10.464886889537526
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: —O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	12.072522375898597
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	7.009000557844773
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.	15.51187303449409
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	12.494727825567187
It’s the bazaar fireworks.	23.11188589714789
But Gerty was adamant.	15.331125603964113
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	10.685646675013809
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	13.677878921685936
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	10.176856306923652
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	17.75955604007738
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	29.250824309799096
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	18.48144883722682
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	10.638393779955715
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	15.413413568578346
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	24.111014797960653
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	15.339518820820494
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	15.286258538584464
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	16.790856300242243
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	13.09619946037413
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	13.342497548649012
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	15.648594229589921
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	20.884710485569386
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	13.03186271039981
What a brute he had been! At it again?	17.503379547537893
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	7.440195097977019
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	20.572464261111275
Should a girl tell?	15.289581717650355
No, a thousand times no.	32.17174543609055
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.	12.57149856190824
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: —Gerty! Gerty! We’re going.	19.133629866804426
Come on.	8.994870683542715
We can see from farther up.	13.773220607275398
Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.	27.412139329688408
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	10.284695500746974
Wonder if he’s too far to.	16.502733232867634
She rose.	12.68044909094663
Was it goodbye?	19.936120633619712
No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve.	32.023860850771115
She drew herself up to her full height.	14.787682180450505
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	14.1719523621708
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	15.496894294510366
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	16.12570590721248
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	16.11205138251431
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was...	9.07362301916301
Tight boots?	16.58211792698403
No. She’s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	17.337081725625474
Poor girl! That’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	15.841232459027115
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	14.869493868765183
Jilted beauty.	11.089130599646298
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	8.096057962671342
But makes them polite.	11.973430566688942
Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show.	16.998783050325216
Hot little devil all the same.	6.909518299606943
I wouldn’t mind.	9.941938706837986
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	16.683303231354156
That squinty one is delicate.	12.008437022306547
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	11.389826251209216
I have such a bad headache today.	10.969691030102958
Where did I put the letter?	21.25061445365541
Yes, all right.	30.507347000741355
All kinds of crazy longings.	11.021016508017698
Licking pennies.	12.599684944605478
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	8.566650810491774
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	14.207572499907483
Martha, she.	0.9584669804922417
Something in the air.	10.31264983659334
That’s the moon.	16.05305433174718
But then why don’t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	18.152507871752043
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	33.388872249852696
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	8.011206956950167
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	7.153912958980944
Anyhow I got the best of that.	11.904900750798825
Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	10.701763463955036
That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing.	9.32522455242324
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	25.501727771690067
Thankful for small mercies.	8.55639188197318
Cheap too.	5.167893237494866
Yours for the asking.	22.95912633371416
Because they want it themselves.	14.551973882644846
Their natural craving.	11.148858409578036
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	15.763402406026634
Reserve better.	8.732813016406928
Don’t want it they throw it at you.	11.5989905413468
Catch em alive, O.	5.917124252159695
Pity they can’t see themselves.	9.659795673037305
A dream of wellfilled hose.	9.715823360595907
Where was that?	7.269529256136452
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	10.09973513105295
Peeping Tom.	19.8459753406449
Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it.	17.225124544084803
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	14.852423263691794
_Lingerie_ does it.	3.9447879085184323
Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also when they’re.	15.957940467495947
I’m all clean come and dirty me.	7.344642419401074
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	22.558822636454
Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.	13.116392485636231
At first.	7.145629591813955
Put them all on to take them all off.	23.46651849694521
Molly.	14.916124459691183
Why I bought her the violet garters.	17.004315878689845
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	15.111521468560476
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	12.505113079621692
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	4.602165660731919
of jet.	16.58211792698403
Pinned together.	8.572509804002673
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	5.328925224909749
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	14.016266418611394
Fashion part of their charm.	22.547279060242378
Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.	18.643130851623532
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	7.130916833148997
No reasonable offer refused.	7.622878559556313
Always off to a fellow when they are.	18.485132688107605
They never forget an appointment.	15.732461343567536
Out on spec probably.	7.804757333944274
They believe in chance because like themselves.	5.884866135784947
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	25.358518028878983
Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	10.561868169739979
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can’t get.	10.840062338438361
Barbed wire.	12.599684944605478
Be sure now and write to me.	10.010845071676597
And I’ll write to you.	7.963954402968397
Now won’t you?	5.53782626567304
Molly and Josie Powell.	21.110079316026834
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	9.44492170116503
_Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	24.554931939282227
What have you been doing with yourself?	9.532813944068913
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	9.19620364572851
Picking holes in each other’s appearance.	15.490919634434517
You’re looking splendid.	8.209834428263537
Sister souls.	10.595029903244942
Showing their teeth at one another.	5.933514056970365
How many have you left?	20.159960243358245
Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch of salt.	14.648411170292686
Ah! Devils they are when that’s coming on them.	15.192919361317053
Dark devilish appearance.	8.4492546945381
Molly often told me feel things a ton weight.	9.858377834131625
Scratch the sole of my foot.	12.495742764103536
O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	11.25719222664915
Good to rest once in a way.	8.263128767931672
Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then.	21.57750565098818
Safe in one way.	17.455269365429793
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	11.93585552671273
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	9.038111798970293
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt.	15.896558287617287
All are.	12.902368585397229
Daresay she felt I.	9.645514634257992
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	18.56240384501011
Liked me or what?	8.657185769031777
Dress they look at.	31.712423218642634
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	5.926130241868968
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	10.810466842139194
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	4.4930737528982245
Trousers?	32.13581597679176
Suppose I when I was?	19.659291991342034
No. Gently does it.	7.75220419005739
Dislike rough and tumble.	8.829249560946922
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	15.424372892926934
Saw something in me.	12.889564681536406
Wonder what.	28.833364133203595
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	8.993227654345
To aid gentleman in literary.	8.376253214868106
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	10.402394715352049
Didn’t let her see me in profile.	20.512811949766594
Still, you never know.	22.0286166186926
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	6.14633179370776
Beauty and the beast.	18.356799482800763
Besides I can’t be so if Molly.	9.283506060684491
Wide brim.	16.58211792698403
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	10.608107187388907
Hair strong in rut.	10.089288358970672
Ten bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street.	12.294782991387844
Why not?	7.2406058056257905
Suppose he gave her money.	21.623774425444875
Why not?	7.2406058056257905
All a prejudice.	16.92538249648606
She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	33.080709233283116
I think so.	14.671196542798068
All that for nothing.	17.419604673399505
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	8.367601009250956
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	21.914537278689057
And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie.	25.40347213545568
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	14.222192092319077
No, I remember.	21.80084599693579
Richie Goulding: he’s another.	22.27186832051224
Weighs on his mind.	15.432655232436902
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	7.223930108840857
Dust.	32.13581597679176
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	6.273738907189911
Could do it myself.	8.574501507618802
Save.	25.50621404370786
Was that just when he, she?	5.384210981329464
O, he did.	26.91071039457195
Into her.	5.297514951622471
She did.	16.875528743607145
Done.	22.281730317965827
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	10.23906655718926
O Lord, that little limping devil.	20.48093042923573
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	10.288111764400162
Aftereffect not pleasant.	11.148858409578036
They don’t care.	11.907474123988536
Complimented perhaps.	7.491817491458749
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	11.582744468556012
Well, aren’t they?	16.313972593555647
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	15.043582412081419
The name too.	8.603024221231848
_Amours_ of actresses.	11.148858409578036
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	11.440619275792587
Curtain up.	5.510443277684281
Moonlight silver effulgence.	7.936616296083693
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	9.149780810610805
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	6.7672722009643635
Still, I feel.	18.28721340331065
The strength it gives a man.	6.730932705620939
That’s the secret of it.	10.583351525637768
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s.	14.592467710860417
Cider that was.	8.357030347423954
Otherwise I couldn’t have.	8.040083621599644
Makes you want to sing after.	17.630761730461156
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	11.148858409578036
Suppose I spoke to her.	6.001746333294456
What about?	25.16701793716805
Bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation.	10.13180541528283
Ask them a question they ask you another.	14.085906500594785
Good idea if you’re stuck.	12.002230792365975
Gain time.	5.672954291597353
But then you’re in a cart.	14.15833602498233
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening.	26.85843256338496
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	13.20962573168553
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	6.791764367178407
All the dirty things I made her say.	17.795463024166416
All wrong of course.	6.9663025782223285
My arks she called it.	3.634194922001879
It’s so hard to find one who.	26.11798427624459
Aho! If you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	14.51833070503552
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	12.718851900226959
Parrots.	32.13581597679176
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	14.047336930827308
Wish she hadn’t called me sir.	8.44450616316334
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s what they enjoy.	29.464642492814964
Taking a man from another woman.	14.025245415130657
Or even hear of it.	4.351887059919235
Different with me.	4.559397598166568
Glad to get away from other chap’s wife.	26.028282589442803
Eating off his cold plate.	15.208550754797107
French letter still in my pocketbook.	16.014897251366843
Cause of half the trouble.	14.011065634447062
But might happen sometime, I don’t think.	6.0883200657636465
I dreamt.	23.60097507926347
Worst is beginning.	11.148858409578036
How they change the venue when it’s not what they like.	16.000057217587116
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	16.24406093544144
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	12.313798388844763
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	19.74779638024095
Because I did.	11.683784073235113
She too.	5.167893237494866
Offend her.	5.297514951622471
Then make it up.	6.635116129079034
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	8.210521531312114
Flatters them.	5.354180925719555
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	12.748678326015884
What harm?	27.943134074106364
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	22.923458131600906
First kiss does the trick.	5.3745882883549
The propitious moment.	5.95504205364476
Something inside them goes pop.	7.848394559256099
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	13.844781383273949
First thoughts are best.	6.347442741854127
Remember that till their dying day.	6.081920224098059
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	8.889088413241918
Fifteen she told me.	4.204853613056794
But her breasts were developed.	7.848394559256099
Fell asleep then.	7.261874658436227
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	12.410635492518866
Featherbed mountain.	12.599684944605478
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	7.643119124711734
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	21.281034438914674
Val Dillon.	30.869685532944267
Apoplectic.	32.13581597679176
My fireworks.	13.943843522115227
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	23.094950142944924
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	20.428550223785155
Want to be grownups.	30.9233774817321
Dressing in mother’s clothes.	13.030417446403803
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	12.796928023814313
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	24.725217293185278
I knew she could whistle.	28.056788567584455
Mouth made for that.	6.590662636665124
Like Molly.	9.324810169522841
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	24.524271052045478
I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	13.844563145994892
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	5.926835850281213
Caressing the little boy too.	8.901464414127682
Onlookers see most of the game.	14.010599893091893
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	11.812525147003852
In their line.	8.77360649995982
Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.	25.0878866156195
Wouldn’t give that satisfaction.	14.045292364586404
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	4.989409762724603
Fine eyes she had, clear.	21.806859209374828
It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	18.761707247978578
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump.	21.363796797354336
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	8.981330495099199
Call that innocence?	11.148858409578036
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	11.010529450911996
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	17.046250345861566
Eyes all over them.	13.728776464803664
Look under the bed for what’s not there.	22.933389554919273
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	11.252634013927278
Sharp as needles they are.	5.264591176741691
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	14.85010990503263
Had, too.	7.212452927051137
Where do they get that?	15.378321048840531
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	11.912150208387207
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	17.41011828885056
Bred in the bone.	18.160210901667465
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	16.17298706517512
Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror.	21.983525941845645
And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	17.136049876389684
I never told her.	19.312529894398086
Neat way she carries parcels too.	5.313923508989176
Attract men, small thing like that.	7.5529669628425715
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	23.17590632040669
Who did you learn that from?	21.48503894526834
Nobody.	22.281730317965827
Something the nurse taught me.	4.678211753590872
O, don’t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	13.397695675390954
Me have a nice pace.	23.519939403147585
Mullingar.	18.793139189616713
Who knows?	11.787611917640778
Ways of the world.	8.28069163870803
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	11.774386957452258
Still she was game.	16.055969652782554
Lord, I am wet.	22.245065192235366
Devil you are.	6.8363877872455605
Swell of her calf.	22.361989840073935
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	7.997703412787702
Not like that frump today.	14.66582070579653
A.	9.643960518690632
E.	10.582866589593744
Rumpled stockings.	15.079680280383519
Or the one in Grafton street.	13.102707522581396
White.	25.50621404370786
Wow! Beef to the heel.	15.066649203388117
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	4.96635755534808
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	6.6957233368952975
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	18.571351447884762
Will she?	12.429226669332564
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	6.671837225341099
She smelt an onion.	7.622878559556313
Darling, I saw, your.	28.307783907218536
I saw all.	17.099625961494333
Lord! Did me good all the same.	8.402039320973932
Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.	8.128295836094285
For this relief much thanks.	4.208858131285129
In _Hamlet,_ that is.	4.959655426330803
Lord! It was all things combined.	29.355565036408795
Excitement.	32.13581597679176
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	15.851602906633502
Your head it simply swirls.	6.194709281870844
He’s right.	10.800121400275406
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	9.822120506523014
Instead of talking about nothing.	15.726683562727684
Then I will tell you all.	6.393405481965622
Still it was a kind of language between us.	17.347015937516844
It couldn’t be?	14.23231633912773
No, Gerty they called her.	18.977656760027045
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.	19.58666023272927
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.	14.338747979664587
Place made me think of that I suppose.	18.358220309979735
All tarred with the same brush.	25.384508620368536
Wiping pens in their stockings.	11.915509902521794
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	25.176019097912285
Every bullet has its billet.	8.665330132049261
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	7.646022564391449
Crooked as a ram’s horn.	26.76344361514293
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	13.435251210080636
No soft job.	8.995516578411697
Saves them.	5.354180925719555
Keeps them out of harm’s way.	16.501197512749133
Nature.	32.13581597679176
Washing child, washing corpse.	11.338195826605284
Dignam.	14.44968689830552
Children’s hands always round them.	8.24464970809028
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	9.124288652566483
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	14.009917538705633
Fill it up with wind.	17.879401570041683
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	16.602332897866
Must call to the hospital.	22.382573681180872
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	6.732109875853423
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	14.456005397682135
That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	9.955346867484208
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	21.819702205883615
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	17.740828918345823
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	7.451622075164847
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	16.267741732796726
Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night?	12.746569231950197
Bad policy however to fault the husband.	6.220054322836785
Chickens come home to roost.	18.18777289194392
They stick by one another like glue.	14.114364818041853
Maybe the women’s fault also.	14.1062569052706
That’s where Molly can knock spots off them.	7.360218632380747
It’s the blood of the south.	19.084632316878256
Moorish.	25.50621404370786
Also the form, the figure.	61.39952540616632
Hands felt for the opulent.	11.150843480513148
Just compare for instance those others.	7.498121672706188
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	21.79703903976606
Allow me to introduce my.	20.6572981645198
Always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife.	18.76231137061731
Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love.	21.930108810469807
Have their own secrets between them.	6.552798046737949
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand.	15.783712610940793
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	17.349047855869937
As God made them he matched them.	7.534692997897637
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	8.047568329036684
Twice nought makes one.	4.536858643807546
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	6.061046263445814
Marry in May and repent in December.	6.439517246972131
This wet is very unpleasant.	11.557561115590532
Stuck.	32.13581597679176
Well the foreskin is not back.	6.509102757824891
Better detach.	16.58211792698403
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	17.94435392121773
Long and the short of it.	11.970612052232278
Big he and little she.	12.469218630773863
Very strange about my watch.	9.48107601233799
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	11.194506316981727
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	24.58523129064255
Yes, I suppose, at once.	19.095900035012875
Cat’s away, the mice will play.	28.82740411928563
I remember looking in Pill lane.	12.901234244409906
Also that now is magnetism.	13.010796052552838
Back of everything magnetism.	10.089288358970672
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	11.069489295655847
That causes movement.	8.949652011548354
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.	16.38108730852167
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	8.072814453226309
Because it’s all arranged.	18.116859156565347
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars.	12.205152323284128
Little piece of steel iron.	15.066760378624734
When you hold out the fork.	24.405566803760166
Come.	14.44968689830552
Come.	14.44968689830552
Woman and man that is.	11.273227491647742
Fork and steel.	8.080465848484218
Molly, he.	28.295314817777818
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	14.52620072770702
Have to let fly.	16.125286679127136
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	23.550351880945655
Shame all put on before third person.	8.718110346066911
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	17.673234402987006
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	18.244198135589308
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	6.743779708558119
Fine voice that fellow had.	12.789847874625547
How Giuglini began.	8.080465848484218
Smell that I did.	18.721960661342905
Like flowers.	10.595029903244942
Violets.	32.13581597679176
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	27.79541278184357
Make their own use of everything.	18.548732165081734
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.	7.093079949319264
But lots of them can’t kick the beam, I think.	11.051780681462409
Keep that thing up for hours.	15.492302790681816
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	16.09195109066454
Hm. Hm. Yes.	9.731479406707566
That’s her perfume.	23.23679010668531
Why she waved her hand.	4.884334215977426
I leave you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.	12.896755646599004
What is it?	5.933985884478757
Heliotrope?	32.13581597679176
No. Hyacinth?	35.757341761210945
Hm. Roses, I think.	7.938061871866168
She’d like scent of that kind.	26.629086973057262
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	7.978726134205925
Why Molly likes opoponax.	8.55639188197318
Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed.	19.119594813372416
Her high notes and her low notes.	13.245742322903213
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	22.131338111168812
Heat brought it out.	9.290117370125698
Good conductor, is it?	4.900847682088693
Or bad?	16.58211792698403
Light too.	5.167893237494866
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.	20.881144524558277
Mysterious thing too.	4.387016086573923
Why did I smell it only now?	11.509835750454792
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	6.426029917263614
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	11.71591595442873
Yes, it is.	7.643385578774121
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	5.229757390890532
Tell you what it is.	7.036781248215644
It’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	11.14518899429067
Clings to everything she takes off.	6.6652470498724155
Vamp of her stockings.	18.620452758735087
Warm shoe.	16.58211792698403
Stays.	32.13581597679176
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	5.888750859586602
Byby till next time.	4.030509328174743
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	11.270268913811178
Know her smell in a thousand.	14.302272825880944
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	7.646284631355276
Wonder where it is really.	33.301182330767055
There or the armpits or under the neck.	14.617974206240985
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	15.39285436668677
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	4.4930737528982245
Muskrat.	32.13581597679176
One grain pour off odour for years.	5.317908552949511
Dogs at each other behind.	9.069032813721835
Good evening.	11.725328032605423
Evening.	32.13581597679176
How do you sniff?	18.448063639522534
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	9.26090110794072
Animals go by that.	10.183419163606722
Yes now, look at it that way.	12.677915399232331
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	14.151332150056259
Come near.	11.725328032605423
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	8.313476829212595
Like what?	7.841199444473143
Potted herrings gone stale or.	5.810082344558442
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	11.231682334446822
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	16.239307062202844
What though?	16.58211792698403
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	12.354899275058301
Breath?	32.13581597679176
What you eat and drink gives that.	5.5580969834159974
No. Mansmell, I mean.	16.05278559052681
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	17.05924049732197
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.	9.644603644919691
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	34.451076330276095
The tree of forbidden priest.	6.708426236547828
O, father, will you?	14.394918663899116
Let me be the first to.	16.110879884801342
Source of life.	4.845299384305662
And it’s extremely curious the smell.	23.940712854283127
Celery sauce.	12.599684944605478
Let me.	9.326640026236687

Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	15.872983413523425
Almonds or.	11.725328032605423
No. Lemons it is.	9.915563273426356
Ah no, that’s the soap.	21.85624482101693
O by the by that lotion.	21.15381324868434
I knew there was something on my mind.	16.799368168183793
Never went back and the soap not paid.	20.99309308040182
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.	7.160383856707993
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	15.754486362750905
I could mention Meagher’s just to remind him.	11.321116561572124
Still if he works that paragraph.	21.623686115740977
Two and nine.	7.999030289653583
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.	14.156075516218513
Call tomorrow.	11.089130599646298
How much do I owe you?	10.519872220484345
Three and nine?	36.84888012244112
Two and nine, sir.	7.724828890121396
Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time.	5.319242797418662
Lose your customers that way.	4.268628605841441
Pubs do.	7.415748579130837
Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.	13.284414071740613
Here’s this nobleman passed before.	9.555987704636046
Blown in from the bay.	14.941915104194129
Always at home at dinnertime.	16.87086255699452
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.	9.042233971197904
Enjoying nature now.	4.429616469187592
Grace after meals.	7.297718413506185
After supper walk a mile.	8.665330132049261
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit.	13.840877867923588
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	10.801176207976143
Still you learn something.	9.99808480875526
See ourselves as others see us.	3.84809875752888
So long as women don’t mock what matter?	11.952189931245751
That’s the way to find out.	16.710292810075114
Ask yourself who is he now.	8.143655762624965

Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.	6.863526403516379
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	29.307817289432812
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	9.186669949172995
Whistle brings rain they say.	4.0379339622134545
Must be some somewhere.	13.299416089073322
Salt in the Ormond damp.	19.850081064338646
The body feels the atmosphere.	14.285161301566779

Mother Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling.	16.434672974007626
No. Signs of rain it is.	9.662988910329375
The royal reader.	12.872306092276881
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	6.292755311257015
Howth.	25.50621404370786
Bailey light.	12.959306904414468
Two, four, six, eight, nine.	11.920592615845464
See.	18.793139189616713
Has to change or they might think it a house.	16.76670159867919
Wreckers.	32.13581597679176
Grace Darling.	16.58211792698403
People afraid of the dark.	14.183179447588554
Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time.	3.4173430061211363
Jewels diamonds flash better.	5.57999026965073
Women.	32.13581597679176
Light is a kind of reassuring.	19.306818430560003
Not going to hurt you.	7.6294472350271425
Better now of course than long ago.	10.870961338249643
Country roads.	16.58211792698403
Run you through the small guts for nothing.	9.812401839793184
Still two types there are you bob against.	10.528965568867335
Scowl or smile.	7.034454096093026
Pardon! Not at all.	5.99902676832565
Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun.	12.524659524017228
Some light still.	6.576650952291391
Red rays are longest.	7.622878559556313

A star I see.	8.108093458926101
Venus?	32.13581597679176
Can’t tell yet.	12.383617850215895
Two.	20.244295502353957
When three it’s night.	10.512632439926934
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	8.08929851201106
Looks like a phantom ship.	15.189510678010679
No. Wait.	24.98820011791772
Trees are they?	8.214954872484089
An optical illusion.	11.148858409578036
Mirage.	32.13581597679176
Land of the setting sun this.	13.02551600196793
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	21.391614803431278
My native land, goodnight.	14.691993927045122
Dew falling.	13.943843522115227
Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone.	38.72521297505718
Brings on white fluxions.	8.55639188197318
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through.	8.091831837510359
Might get piles myself.	5.737533304325978
Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth.	15.096812351041388
Cut with grass or paper worst.	6.14633179370776
Like to be that rock she sat on.	14.931137730578033
O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked.	9.181305070940784
I begin to like them at that age.	14.553399972639452
Green apples.	16.58211792698403
Grab at all that offer.	25.469874197446853
Suppose it’s the only time we cross legs, seated.	12.369610521907719
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	9.757618218335027
Happy chairs under them.	4.027102612492702
But it’s the evening influence.	22.171010149541818
They feel all that.	7.646736325716378
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	7.9035986138148555
Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then.	12.955306376847558
June that was too I wooed.	23.340845235343888
The year returns.	10.333135095970073
History repeats itself.	11.827916284126271
Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.	7.652602078221176
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	8.45995994921196
And now?	17.77426247530903
Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	17.51129705557954
They take advantage.	14.786396833216765
All quiet on Howth now.	5.224964579019928
The distant hills seem.	9.910497547215114
Where we.	10.595029903244942
The rhododendrons.	13.943843522115227
I am a fool perhaps.	16.004891910977964
He gets the plums, and I the plumstones.	17.69996670750766
Where I come in.	9.10735969915295
All that old hill has seen.	17.901436435445493
Names change: that’s all.	6.4906285104097625
Lovers: yum yum.	8.55639188197318
Tired I feel now.	8.161475583732583
Will I get up?	14.493546312789205
O wait.	11.160212072753245
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.	26.398845029102514
She kissed me.	4.150460101210741
Never again.	5.909382163877581
My youth.	13.943843522115227
Only once it comes.	8.279211252996465
Or hers.	11.725328032605423
Take the train there tomorrow.	8.027163662120827
No. Returning not the same.	19.414570287007752
Like kids your second visit to a house.	6.751286674022608
The new I want.	16.127217395894053
Nothing new under the sun.	8.492098133693121
Care of P.	6.6342192417083234
Dolphin’s Barn.	14.765422284008473
Are you not happy in your?	7.855363176249186
Naughty darling.	11.725328032605423
At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s house.	8.889521450344095
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty.	6.503758752673074
Molly too.	5.167893237494866
Eightyseven that was.	8.357030347423954
Year before we.	16.988141597344107
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	17.02029913368861
Curious she an only child, I an only child.	10.959310936822861
So it returns.	12.808961334324536
Think you’re escaping and run into yourself.	8.389362216636709
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	8.559137980570508
And just when he and she.	29.272005142594374
Circus horse walking in a ring.	19.3750081941771
Rip van Winkle we played.	7.868707534351673
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat.	14.107734957642029
Van: breadvan delivering.	10.82639741088797
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	8.665330132049261
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	12.612003252770913
She leaned on the sideboard watching.	21.7004029570806
Moorish eyes.	6.061679814198452
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	12.154392445972587
All changed.	12.599684944605478
Forgotten.	25.50621404370786
The young are old.	10.169476733901467
His gun rusty from the dew.	17.806797259038618
Ba. What is that flying about?	16.648847702811146
Swallow?	32.13581597679176
Bat probably.	8.572509804002673
Thinks I’m a tree, so blind.	13.670550435174796
Have birds no smell?	10.82639741088797
Metempsychosis.	32.13581597679176
They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	9.82406734219081
Weeping willow.	16.58211792698403
Ba. There he goes.	11.218064369621153
Wonder where he lives.	17.399680385837637
Belfry up there.	6.68207119333765
Very likely.	11.725328032605423
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	28.83360420687883
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	11.432457864795692
Mass seems to be over.	13.904317726877062
Could hear them all at it.	14.69396054011207
Pray for us.	14.374288006606223
Good idea the repetition.	10.559871460837
Same thing with ads.	11.37318665176595
Buy from us.	5.288440522201812
And buy from us.	4.595911818353977
Yes, there’s the light in the priest’s house.	24.760692535872014
Their frugal meal.	8.949652011548354
Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s.	12.356795929423095
Twentyeight it is.	5.567660174041145
Two houses they have.	7.71862470743601
Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate.	19.08659072048155
Ba. Again.	13.89095698543777
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	16.31572870052966
They’re a mixed breed.	14.175031709844133
Birds are like hopping mice.	8.643554063265618
What frightens them, light or noise?	13.804603352648407
Better sit still.	6.576650952291391
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	11.15723804508409
Weeny bones.	9.85978631029179
Colours depend on the light you see.	15.92969592977938
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	14.572723951367195
Wants to stamp his trademark on everything.	6.219865340683751
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	20.975394910559032
Colour of brown turf.	11.191029921471666
Say you never see them with three colours.	21.53628508328946
Not true.	9.573690248878348
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	12.31409773688125
Body fifty different colours.	7.124763581548046
Howth a while ago amethyst.	8.665330132049261
Glass flashing.	13.943843522115227
That’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass.	15.487020676335424
Then the heather goes on fire.	13.5309986822385
It can’t be tourists’ matches.	8.690960322942933
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	7.523010124238173
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	14.644303574390872
Archimedes.	32.13581597679176
I have it! My memory’s not so bad.	35.34579023881694
Ba. Who knows what they’re always flying for.	14.57575961938824
Insects?	32.13581597679176
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	25.946710178668088
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	24.460367683484204
Birds too.	5.167893237494866
Or what they say.	6.59923340046375
Like our small talk.	8.279211252996465
And says she and says he.	8.76403642386922
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	14.888710969179924
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	9.944476231913981
Dreadful life sailors have too.	3.6379895599899292
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	7.776709158861556
_Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	8.461083875101695
Married too.	5.167893237494866
No ends really because it’s round.	11.248101882800814
Wife in every port they say.	6.911909930943921
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	7.793452968165727
If ever he does.	14.846626626938377
Smelling the tail end of ports.	12.898673889510247
How can they like the sea?	36.11877400518397
Yet they do.	9.065236870586771
The anchor’s weighed.	26.431179229370375
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	18.281433705857985
Well.	20.244295502353957
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on his door to touch.	14.421253742370713
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	13.916465396184572
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	12.285091784317501
Do fish ever get seasick?	8.665330132049261
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	7.208044023059362
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	19.595453790981182
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	5.852775936000206
They floated, fell: they faded.	13.658936308401193
The shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	17.295507038781828
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	12.238972863622966
And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace.	9.37556802358318
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	6.193516692675986
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	9.55451670254076
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	10.010916406177351
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	4.03281055448715
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	16.019589292404152
Irish Lights board.	8.949652011548354
Penance for their sins.	13.253521503845949
Coastguards too.	5.167893237494866
Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat.	7.978726134205925
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	20.243286722303264
Bears in the zoo.	35.667072199669704
Filthy trip.	16.58211792698403
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	16.453287061110654
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	8.271438194476845
Nausea.	32.13581597679176
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	25.499269673528783
Milly, no sign of funk.	26.344603188247238
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	7.146554757307092
Don’t know what death is at that age.	12.446302814184063
And then their stomachs clean.	12.089096723190941
But being lost they fear.	8.028808087109397
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	10.339388936255418
I didn’t want to.	7.247057547154693
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	11.058684879131238
Frightening them with masks too.	6.168180520248151
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	11.65282040996191
Is it only half fun?	23.010035570157086
Or children playing battle.	8.55639188197318
Whole earnest.	13.943843522115227
How can people aim guns at each other.	5.4826563575932035
Sometimes they go off.	12.119526630806904
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	5.803997007685214
Calomel purge I got her for that.	9.6662310853702
After getting better asleep with Molly.	5.885328704735977
Very same teeth she has.	6.756905983408693
What do they love?	25.793552912450732
Another themselves?	16.58211792698403
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	33.80581033761024
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	12.925245184738088
I felt her pulse.	17.572188056259275
Ticking.	32.13581597679176
Little hand it was: now big.	18.51828639310968
Dearest Papli.	14.45922143842678
All that the hand says when you touch.	21.722832053534994
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	8.004257155785652
Her first stays I remember.	7.401617094747956
Made me laugh to see.	6.0743328782819095
Little paps to begin with.	4.966176017587157
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	7.310866764776443
Mine too.	5.167893237494866
Nearer the heart?	12.917660053916105
Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion.	6.964460368418194
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	5.822485500431786
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	20.720753344781762
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	7.652438923363023
Brings back her girlhood.	10.82639741088797
Gibraltar.	20.244295502353957
Looking from Buena Vista.	8.55639188197318
O’Hara’s tower.	33.53426739687075
The seabirds screaming.	11.148858409578036
Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	6.17772640575036
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	9.65563185702972
Looking out over the sea she told me.	8.124264656501943
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	21.178490053188515
I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	18.613826042151928
_Buenas noches, señorita.	9.072081681998874
El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	6.14633179370776
Why me?	7.274431494472446
Because you were so foreign from the others.	21.156968046235765
Better not stick here all night like a limpet.	19.628072594614046
This weather makes you dull.	8.287173002997996
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	17.230119325811476
Go home.	11.160212072753245
Too late for _Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up.	10.767955819395656
Call to the hospital to see.	11.06552777186827
Hope she’s over.	9.722753505230646
Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus’ song.	22.4653602864188
Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan’s.	3.6266476564846384
Got my own back there.	7.554527384061214
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	24.313125896360013
Mistake to hit back.	4.374475573553072
Or?	25.50621404370786
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	25.12085330630631
Always want to be swilling in company.	15.218487620291235
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	27.38769137979213
Suppose he hit me.	7.131691469133281
Look at it other way round.	27.488270809648952
Not so bad then.	9.953812154474635
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	17.16920209291425
Three cheers for Israel.	10.797781064167562
Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	10.132085290529584
Same style of beauty.	8.446135981947414
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	9.191904936735426
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	17.29135943447825
Imagine that in the early morning at close range.	19.025258172418162
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	12.67095461766142
But Dignam’s put the boots on it.	16.115816320724296
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	5.855717268948142
Anyhow she wants the money.	8.795069593073558
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	15.963806549753485
Strange name.	7.20859276391317
Takes it for granted we’re going to pop off first.	9.96032812960727
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer’s that looked at me.	9.386332702769865
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	13.881411861405045
Her widow’s mite.	24.25781657281104
Well?	17.685021073205338
What do you expect her to do?	19.236499586748508
Must wheedle her way along.	8.424158136768236
Widower I hate to see.	9.242758847196793
Looks so forlorn.	9.70564496856689
Poor man O’Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.	7.600848038223838
The sewage.	12.599684944605478
Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron.	16.164494286716334
Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain.	10.947557304902706
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	6.6590356403157855
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	8.846585799655385
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die.	8.139098146443738
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.	6.928852358571832
U.	12.75310702185393
Fate that is.	5.708092415471332
He, not me.	10.80151402505605
Also a shop often noticed.	8.665330132049261
Curse seems to dog it.	5.339539202022674
Dreamt last night?	9.124923535401642
Something confused.	13.943843522115227
She had red slippers on.	9.358964267577532
Turkish.	25.50621404370786
Suppose she does?	29.09765638127956
Damned hard to answer.	15.67439266359054
Nannetti’s gone.	11.083116472557652
Mailboat.	32.13581597679176
Near Holyhead by now.	3.833535841944677
Must nail that ad of Keyes’s.	5.027984041060341
Work Hynes and Crawford.	6.5432824295768865
Petticoats for Molly.	12.093441797282583
She has something to put in them.	19.921017730287993
What’s that?	10.206343241996194
Might be money.	12.077346459419081
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	35.190130596005815
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	23.518467590538172
Letter?	32.13581597679176
No. Can’t read.	18.611713794691976
Better go.	8.572509804002673
Better.	25.50621404370786
I’m tired to move.	19.622654265533345
Page of an old copybook.	20.845328486680287
All those holes and pebbles.	10.4285827885703
Who could count them?	7.506604705439695
Never know what you find.	32.26443913605014
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	17.695085285387172
Parcels post.	16.58211792698403
Children always want to throw things in the sea.	13.519299095870863
Trust?	32.13581597679176
Bread cast on the waters.	14.664740230245146
What’s this?	22.432167849905017
Bit of stick.	10.01942386405799
O! Exhausted that female has me.	6.456744717812284
Not so young now.	8.819151039116207
Will she come here tomorrow?	11.194506316981727
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	13.906244130835104
Must come back.	7.696911869448456
Murderers do.	7.415748579130837
Will I?	14.445850153738848
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	14.790216800769732
Write a message for her.	5.0663720945032615
Might remain.	16.58211792698403
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	9.225000148273022
Useless.	32.13581597679176
Washed away.	6.723409576072403
Tide comes here.	6.416226493124131
Saw a pool near her foot.	11.407903354368212
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	22.545258155891805
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	5.531581693883869
O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know.	10.530189930417398
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	5.932658761926659
AM.	32.13581597679176
A.	9.643960518690632
No room.	10.19448965235056
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	20.98640181808445
Hopeless thing sand.	7.791124599957709
Nothing grows in it.	3.8230747843549677
All fades.	16.58211792698403
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	6.780674987631318
Except Guinness’s barges.	23.424428481656804
Round the Kish in eighty days.	6.679937770737762
Done half by design.	12.116599241714928
He flung his wooden pen away.	6.370622362521909
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	8.711840118943757
Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t.	22.23729665489162
Chance.	32.13581597679176
We’ll never meet again.	11.766682284275156
But it was lovely.	23.747233064524128
Goodbye, dear.	12.044442156460066
Thanks.	20.244295502353957
Made me feel so young.	20.376557726668313
Short snooze now if I had.	10.448084280608645
Must be near nine.	15.662560073188248
Liverpool boat long gone.	6.517995893201855
And she can do the other.	23.171636050127056
Did too.	5.167893237494866
And Belfast.	16.58211792698403
I won’t go.	10.07145560787183
Race there, race back to Ennis.	25.72346622196351
Let him.	10.431188251984057
Just close my eyes a moment.	9.621308715313402
Won’t sleep, though.	17.696160289787276
Half dream.	13.943843522115227
It never comes the same.	10.711998730497424
Bat again.	5.909382163877581
No harm in him.	8.914736358721475
Just a few.	43.997814632989595
O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon _señorita_ young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.	5.5282124949298375
A bat flew.	11.827916284126271
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	20.417356660424243
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	14.84300750937671
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	12.373494905448341
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	9.866675082485894
were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	5.720732449156396
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	18.158721460733688

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction.	6.9341651709892425
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	7.577324663842798
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	15.4445563676111
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	10.268285655601348
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	7.637245036444834
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	7.823027574068343

Some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night’s oncoming.	14.463956915802953
Of Israel’s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared.	17.679212950182286

Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	6.0910266324069795
Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	11.366871499752081
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne’s house.	6.846437837656196

On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	6.010344320424354
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	15.787691935003586

The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	11.696231651383167
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	14.465991610995736
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	5.936937620080118
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	17.44335912930896
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth.	15.126816618457795
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	7.629696633189222
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	17.590323559121952
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	6.14633179370776
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	10.549509614293108
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	23.18502405983454
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	8.446387404844515
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	21.53281997749423
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	12.91643251422142
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	11.65763903576124
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	6.660559009001649
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	13.23032007100419
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	10.680365376042896
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	21.353490262447064
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	6.502611079112773
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	9.340350413299728
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	12.927847340945357
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	13.155125860055326
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	12.643776623608522
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	5.998592361479955
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	18.11813588003893
Thanked be Almighty God.	4.987546417925658
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	8.313118911673264
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	14.320241895852723
Meseems it dureth overlong.	8.55639188197318
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	9.99629897506776
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	11.129603805067969
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	18.210807038490003
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	16.67903740856814
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	9.977267758345107
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	24.141822742155593
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	12.81321946438989
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	17.444721975567262
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner.	14.328285757358858
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	12.40549207201833
For they were right witty scholars.	15.24582191841316
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	10.32164617832494
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	13.905187646784906
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	9.036418026853951
A redress God grant.	10.82639741088797
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	12.339501145947454
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	7.677713718969237
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	10.796579516114734
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	7.101598282938653
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	11.14630940243209
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	13.053690569568285
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	10.952770773885103
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	7.134886437489693
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	5.993034132705551
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	18.30854940982858
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	9.902592830210267
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	13.698405280208359
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	10.42106826876285
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	8.6079123915253
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	6.662216649569759
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	12.962255807797753
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	22.176675462206717
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	10.422690822570225
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	14.47646848182318
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	9.743709303202522
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.	15.176341072233107
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	10.228456912144235
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	9.424646633884922
See ye here.	4.837797977593052
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	13.418954769949268
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	9.130088023166284
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions.	12.667459586831544
What means this?	7.184257632960914
Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	10.571545093756043
Mark me now.	6.597715750744884
In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	10.357885268085955
This is the postcreation.	24.21262728684764
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	4.737713951738864
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	9.616619792353227
But here is the matter now.	9.536323177966086
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	12.0349066439821
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	13.323621033502716
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	5.217205928522846
With will will we withstand, withsay.	7.038896614100696
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	8.953723762890608
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	11.556344464379842
In Horne’s house rest should reign.	12.03935611620369
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	10.376107635680158
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	11.967646650954029
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	15.772366223751192
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	7.286913695917923
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	13.734834181475396
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	6.27244066711494
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	11.703910382830712
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it.	13.173383006879519
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	14.415027028878727
Go thou and do likewise.	14.152984035063202
Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden.	7.238559921551188
Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed.	5.51445960373373
_Orate, fratres, pro memetipso_.	6.14633179370776
And all the people shall say, Amen.	13.090475175409118
Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	11.49116827773721
Therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants.	15.125035039427544
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	9.834642131522008
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	8.475188875775286
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	8.991833219735437
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	7.530205232627606
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	14.07994182968063
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	15.519779047003482
Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion.	8.631656329848623
The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper _ubi_ and _quomodo_.	11.415479204871101
And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	8.094414809015976
The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend.	4.001051096333132
And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	7.945238046070564
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	10.550938024748028
Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack See the malt stored in many a refluent sack, In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.	7.58547145091346
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	8.270391546848776
Loud on left Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler.	7.430799733995639
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	6.452613080086861
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	7.381870742763136
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	14.229879533219217
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	12.456645321008224
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.	8.129910624051556
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	14.95686156491972
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?	14.680499109938333
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	16.07111280338342
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	14.208985825661074
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	26.911744557302928
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	19.68455156244546
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	19.56824371855824
Heard?	32.13581597679176
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	18.35280784747349
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	12.200405368489175
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	17.782882592185835
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	12.52086940418865
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	8.958975429767145
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	11.912348357146909
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her.	9.753043342061622
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	11.233096216879101
So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer.	15.1082524880714
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	14.215701336483258
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	7.082569710069092
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	6.064618346508143
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	11.102104788565528
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	6.014266152269519
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	12.444250326059903
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	8.301180113172645
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the college lands) Mal.	11.983451962641654
Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a good Williamite) chanced against Alec.	20.31952756396788
Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s.	14.384683700874058
There Leop.	13.943843522115227
Bloom of Crawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin.	12.009086281824734
Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will.	23.45751867538008
Madden, T.	10.349088805169332
Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.	10.479283782907505
Leop.	25.50621404370786
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	14.51367932095398
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible.	20.018234417284315
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	11.710669381541855
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	11.226237845307692
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	18.08660023322118
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	10.46359630530224
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	9.79086136771089
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides.	14.778508415463387
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	20.120836542468403
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	18.76645514487237
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	22.65875502368381
There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.	16.864985914772973
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	14.900077243479897
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	17.409535919508887
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	13.61609564372249
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	12.535808374107983
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	20.206254192589963
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	8.849019261937752
I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he.	7.328867075214841
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.	9.076483644882597
I question with you there, says he.	9.945049059919734
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	6.890443015054171
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	12.117422248805646
He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he.	21.561749628424867
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	12.394900104219758
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	11.97915972355409
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	23.333095593744005
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	12.37963269289242
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	12.602429794239844
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	10.804837083951346
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	17.892577295267298
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	16.03176938386088
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content.	14.899566319610498
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	14.36992654938604
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.	8.197773734487772
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	18.820265507228168
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he.	16.874837374353643
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	10.283043887945679
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	14.186880251610319
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	17.110987499129784
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	17.914188388911548
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	17.12717255756085
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	10.290674158155445
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.	18.927119586504713
A man’s a man for a’ that._ Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	16.066115805766866
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	17.790049352292495
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	8.323789163556528
Fertiliser and Incubator.	11.148858409578036
Lambay Island_.	16.58211792698403
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	13.125407927710803
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	10.559760956304197
Come, be seated, both.	21.14939941600936
’Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	7.156520068709707
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	11.615040413803406
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	9.794643101403627
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	7.094396606689187
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	7.996154648364416
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	19.645175459114462
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	7.640944502281117
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies.	8.631224963719841
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	9.900079952943496
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	17.821576921680926
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	11.120135182240121
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	16.79255074004649
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	17.54747911559109
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	12.704348249411373
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	15.152455011344692
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard.	9.26488887789087
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	10.521074381092992
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	12.720952002771023
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	12.861868089766975
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	6.6791377348574175
That you may and very opportunely.	12.97514394016629
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	6.681430756780033
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	21.125452263207823
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	12.475516240516228
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	10.34392837224405
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	14.068668505838836
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	9.480825523252825
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.	11.908282455966235
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	10.698295036530892
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	23.61754910045988
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	7.695671832390188
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	12.07128998359895
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	9.790339400425534
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	15.951941644300648
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	13.956602642922963
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	9.964857901294916
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	9.148030186863558
Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.	13.493523183165143
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	9.06957665049429
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	9.279186138835758
No woman of any wit would wear one.	7.456340243850188
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	11.156436686317992
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	16.47130374830125
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	10.238378970627718
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	14.643591884602607
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	9.078989256688965
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	19.591480527466025
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	5.543264247178769
Have you a way with them?	37.574745825155524
Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	14.968659939692941
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.	24.4168035527707
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin.	10.119769708948574
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months.	15.952992021476549
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.	11.441323105499322
Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	12.819283380032706
I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	12.327770746661516
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	19.36527179708979
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	10.329285519982271
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	18.686258911470325
I cannot away with them.	11.588117258444772
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	20.84394487943296
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	15.537620483135868
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	11.56295507197919
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	10.017639008353502
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	9.158012535126298
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	11.502816803071404
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	8.655409620031609
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	13.017424763636559
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	10.879724956616203
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	8.974363564589208
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	12.374191959089245
To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	17.01233688326187
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	18.235403781439896
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	13.415417656684973
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	11.393396560907725
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	11.261635573727762
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.	7.20277149958515
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	7.425638147435277
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	12.979915371776725
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	9.108073386389599
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	13.025640444791934
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	10.767750198858979
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	11.180194322521874
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	9.347092898007805
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	22.563624990103076
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	13.883741654237545
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	9.280593330632575
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	14.758581305922933
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	9.418303815740662
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	14.310311115780983
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	4.591615911665172
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	4.069917605875636
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	6.800831699392107
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	7.397889208817079
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	12.71533586847043
When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	10.210838178216529
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	14.308246943096929
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	10.31050102036216
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	11.984598595569656
The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a _prima facie_ and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born.	6.561221414014289
The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human.	11.243759214264946
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	11.96378081426151
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	11.027832964050415
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	9.135163859378755
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	6.967458106512189
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	11.939852207037635
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	8.748316554004411
He conjured up the scene before them.	10.445275638763086
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	10.861646798454206
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	11.61610778679819
Yes, it is true.	13.454357895329961
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	10.636065731339572
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	9.43448701037928
This is the appearance is on me.	14.234781080239951
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	12.280077701433372
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	23.812210202845947
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	10.245157449346088
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	5.576751808082182
Dope is my only hope...	5.097778115776207
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	8.967342323829465
He was gone.	17.815928042043254
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	21.81788135550157
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	11.75325117272517
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	5.519955774400373
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	5.610005292268996
The mystery was unveiled.	8.55639188197318
Haines was the third brother.	27.371600549715094
His real name was Childs.	13.087323032842292
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	9.027568620464903
He drank drugs to obliterate.	13.821415526676045
For this relief much thanks.	4.208858131285129
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	11.69451470818905
No soul will live there.	5.093964580111286
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	11.255483962227421
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	10.695187665351257
A curse is on it.	7.22565430105549
It is haunted.	33.73559932167971
Murderer’s ground.	16.425243310230034
What is the age of the soul of man?	31.52191835623421
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	12.409951710040383
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	11.486415202603279
A score of years are blown away.	6.687810032868695
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	16.33778532829458
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought.	17.70470932936624
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	17.878062809405137
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.	21.087619352986337
The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before.	16.293112515337423
But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.	13.390365163124075
Who can say?	13.656336213965963
The wise father knows his own child.	7.980226594235854
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	20.540361318601587
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	19.8113758877429
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	25.847795666273587
Did heart leap to heart?	8.634849971673464
Nay, fair reader.	17.52067990331681
In a breath ’twas done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk.	8.314285499927053
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	21.533170778125168
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	5.588932088058621
No, Leopold.	19.443181875300585
Name and memory solace thee not.	5.641811354727334
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee—and in vain.	5.726965892354586
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	20.242006475356465
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	7.075812240664855
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	3.620047692866243
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	10.32110701983398
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	8.482157050398099
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	6.971757614103902
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	21.063003644127377
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	26.717522450136382
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	23.864831179022804
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	7.352190726769649
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	10.54522498918812
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	8.365579956707911
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	11.42029995481806
And the equine portent grows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo.	12.386677600958231
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	16.906419312762825
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	49.42884189844389
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	10.240676399848674
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	7.620160528925509
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time.	11.719703434386906
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	6.462016810774009
Where were they now?	11.79898763567063
Neither knew.	10.19448965235056
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	12.1073280150698
Why think of them?	16.20240058301753
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	18.573042913531985
Who supposes it?	4.739842389861238
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	7.043670893025705
He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.	7.594929208641936
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	5.763458217193361
All who wish you well hope this for you.	4.530195015186843
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	12.860232749056083
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	7.77308965164411
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	19.80849864059383
Have no fear.	10.01942386405799
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	18.144032872430998
The young man’s face grew dark.	12.379877832306184
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	19.234935523872544
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	19.618948890413044
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.	13.170876710129557
He told them of the race.	16.695752280776556
The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O.	9.923651131751743
Madden up.	4.826182898933149
She was leading the field.	11.561573995214088
All hearts were beating.	12.204095486154442
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	10.456484450548041
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	7.811957720156862
All was lost now.	5.441771207555826
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	12.654315232365162
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	5.8986337809658735
But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook.	12.105697654967164
A tear fell: one only.	8.181554481393132
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	10.097618904435645
Lane.	25.50621404370786
Four winners yesterday and three today.	6.8142051284466545
What rider is like him?	10.453088385948522
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	10.813028927162003
But let us bear it as was the ancient wont.	20.899639708196986
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	13.794789014262946
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	9.892012456925173
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	12.139116327540098
Do you remember her, Vincent?	35.78086160207028
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	12.432692785087513
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	9.518957587496281
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	7.986530839436769
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	10.079096967617502
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close.	25.720152693786424
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	8.292648803742146
She is more taking then.	8.96314261442421
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	3.2132773478425696
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	20.31993333841653
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	18.69381947123688
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	8.958613150041117
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	9.971808757600494
But he had been kind.	23.07351763204914
In going by he had blessed us.	9.2661548808952
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	3.6701670850346466
If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	12.214728897519562
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	13.93318999556822
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	5.227685812711579
His soul is far away.	9.33352042925017
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	23.5199569713112
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	16.37833332196577
Do you not think it, Stephen?	47.0633591272091
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	10.89793172324172
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	11.85848796041595
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	15.730456825484678
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	7.649231643644777
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	9.557512609260936
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	12.539937693418857
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	18.887030090008828
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	8.370089951442921
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	4.702276921229671
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	22.239621688895237
The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	10.195187519418491
A gallant scene in truth it made.	6.974842395999027
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	16.379661236991247
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	3.849037805025007
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	11.02925351018183
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	7.679669938497118
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	7.52069478208861
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	11.421069677468356
Dedalus’ (Div.	9.167065824111468
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	5.991346512386832
Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.	9.518121929194368
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	9.981674104030002
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	9.646563975735866
Bloom (Pubb.	12.598994757599645
Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.	13.272186295748186
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	7.7106183043885705
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	16.817559530225484
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	8.54261558636627
It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways.	15.025703573121703
Mr M.	5.60730411721806
Mulligan (Hyg.	11.148858409578036
et Eug.	16.58211792698403
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	7.215164623687686
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	4.702276921229671
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	8.313622962362391
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	8.61558172860282
Mr J.	4.756694820542829
Crotthers (Disc.	11.148858409578036
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	9.440107222940583
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	9.254312409924925
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	14.974854367091666
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	10.012698955295654
Lynch (Bacc.	9.70564496856689
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	11.089236134012195
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause.	8.469216776964297
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	10.595336802567596
Mr S.	4.615839726433603
Dedalus’ (Div.	9.167065824111468
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	6.217602044606432
For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother.	7.9485559255924105
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	8.4765690461069
Bloom (Pubb.	12.598994757599645
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	14.213407760046756
Horne (Lic.	11.148858409578036
in Midw., F.	5.997402120801752

Q.	25.50621404370786
P.	8.450228160453479
I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.	16.493778990105337
At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	15.183846256528176
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	7.7740469638301635
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	9.522718593238855
She had.	24.97168189996049
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	12.635479366332008
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	18.299983586205528
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	16.09108737608891
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	15.743595202540682
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	17.136470290889694
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	10.442835145989264
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.	12.838386303534229
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	5.636929700054219
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	13.33521146245572
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	13.514975271656443
He knows and will call in His own good time.	10.783099314400511
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part.	7.340689589478497
Sir, to you my hand.	20.21761823125475
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	14.539271278217532
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	14.545366198602155
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	14.8410771897568
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	11.93005812726744
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.	11.136165849865057
A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	13.327972504482151
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	9.937357892437738
And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey, Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in her pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit.	10.730287094536001
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	5.7018363664543665
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	12.50855813285386
Mark this farther and remember.	8.028808087109397
The end comes suddenly.	9.265860191790876
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	10.337596632774222
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	9.37405205233036
But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the thunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the transformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.	7.0934267182197015
Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.	7.438761468726351
A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there.	4.565577868085416
Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme.	7.66968427541517
They hark him on.	8.393491804265317
The door! It is open?	27.201991440273098
Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal.	14.646062442572868
Dixon follows giving them sharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on.	12.089542907936803
Bloom stays with nurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up there.	6.393059031192678
Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet.	7.082569710069092
Looks she too not other now?	5.803873040379041
Ward of watching in Horne’s house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.	8.272778480586116
Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?	12.268692960108353
The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._ God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.	6.815980360178933
Breathe it deep into thee.	6.4148509902083335
By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a doughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor barring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle.	10.122693137957889
Astounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which thou hast fructified with thy modicum of man’s work.	4.982787512283396
Cleave to her! Serve! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all Malthusiasts go hang.	11.461769217342937
Thou art all their daddies, Theodore.	12.820160810820703
Art drooping under thy load, bemoiled with butcher’s bills at home and ingots (not thine!) in the countinghouse?	10.816202472776578
Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt gather thy homer of ripe wheat.	4.9525285274212765
See, thy fleece is drenched.	11.93585552671273
Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan?	10.148450505336719
A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny.	11.478241816854265
Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer.	17.81536263493962
Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name.	14.71084467291427
Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins.	5.930309285297583
A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.	6.890516664765133
With thee it was not as with many that will and would and wait and never—do.	13.196548884640432
Thou sawest thy America, thy lifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison.	9.912687986608471
How saith Zarathustra?	14.786396833216765
_Deine Kuh Trübsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die süsse Milch des Euters_.	3.7420018814041778

BLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown.	24.05202583209663
And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...	12.800842029700734
MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser! BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.	18.875028191798073
MRS BREEN: _(Squeezes his arm, simpers.)_ Naughty cruel I was! BLOOM: _(Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.)_ And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher’s lunch basket.	14.099052262658802
Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style.	16.119562166312694
She was...	7.667250624516783
MRS BREEN: Too...	3.5827233855764327
BLOOM: Yes.	10.936171690007818
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...	10.58453595299129

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one.	9.131636313399726
I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place.	10.224834368263897
I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.	17.35815657107688
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	20.36012505868989

They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury.	16.75290503614246
He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal.	25.328669312508996

To compare the various joys we each enjoy.	7.50864147086246

Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox.	7.330386582284563
By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	4.760055720042041
In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males.	4.7799371239577315
And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see?	11.219351207363975
Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?	6.4764751844124895

Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it.	8.847728540966946

Force of habit.	9.70564496856689
THE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster picnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in fleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century.	7.060931869046633
I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil.	10.007480885359822
I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman.	5.456968430430686
Useful hints to the married.	16.22947203221234

You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch.	7.186685585488562
Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places.	17.398386120231592
And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.	12.98558280126997
BLOOM: _(Humbly kisses her long hair.)_ Your classic curves, beautiful immortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.	18.61992994826776

Frailty, thy name is marriage.	10.33431657025153

She scaled just eleven stone nine.	5.498712007041265
She put on nine pounds after weaning.	11.5849849699036
It was a crack and want of glue.	15.775112298762721

A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies’ cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes, instinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice), even a pricelist of their hosiery.	16.14189390762218
And then the heat.	17.471260139804194
There were sunspots that summer.	10.139129281042145

Where?	14.036610527842967
_(He hurries out through the hall.	19.250365941572582
The whores point.	8.080465848484218

On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off.	10.784663938923579
From the left arrives a jingling hackney car.	12.535473208876777
It slows to in front of the house.	7.2975977321234256
Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers.	25.36021072412766

They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses.	7.082569710069092
Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly lewd smile.	13.109822177500403
The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey.	10.116202820604583
Zoe and Kitty still point right.	6.7643815630714705
Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph’s hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.	8.786505030101429
Incog Haroun al Raschid he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed.	7.984946534275074
The ashplant marks his stride.	5.946783646404766
A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail.	10.039974408016088
He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back.	4.62043572585957
He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, woman’s slipperslappers.	8.339701676842513

This is the age of patent medicines.	12.178758676600033
A discussion is difficult down here.	4.789444561188318
But this is the point.	23.265976472077593
Suppose.	25.50621404370786
_(He places his arm on Private Carr’s sleeve.)_ Not that I wish it for you.	14.124130899217183

_(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master.	18.241278908869766
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand.	11.08502148090055
He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)_ BLOOM: _(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.)_ Rudy! RUDY: _(Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom’s eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling.	8.756774885898452
He has a delicate mauve face.	10.415812479998007
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons.	9.66591954978098
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot.	10.326583299045373
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)_ — III — [ 16 ] Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed.	10.371049734444528
His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	12.833622304637426
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	10.862005474279064
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.	13.229383865123458
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.	10.351873517871605
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	11.368053548982886
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	13.45244880023024
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	9.811280487337605
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	10.54272215037988
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	13.084966797529182
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.	17.53668622278102
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	13.265252510155584
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	13.76784267451081
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	14.04007735233376
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	7.940859689004145
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	17.184681591267484
s.	7.42724343932194
d.	17.685021073205338
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	10.226465989168918
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	21.5380693361845
—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	18.22561171877224
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	9.773359179690484
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	16.223573929953528
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.	12.278010976608588
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	16.73972891946415
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	4.508174148588589
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: —Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	12.269827556220644
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	10.675937099527788
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garrotted.	9.869314580295175
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	15.784863331921043
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	15.198396363321399
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.	16.97918270500692
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	6.804166714196151
Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or some relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen.	13.685352939721712
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	6.266193328261142
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	9.036490186908745
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.	19.325497668738272
His friends had all deserted him.	4.119555987696621
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	15.226521755522125
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all, to do.	16.538786666820215
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	19.06167982379262
Anyhow he was all in.	25.345611558446883
—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks.	16.026944402781204
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	23.617780793820096
Mr Garrett Deasy.	16.25449196449993
Try it.	5.418114139953336
You may mention my name.	8.653403149095709
—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man.	15.763264402527025
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	20.966399199061954
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	26.305227465414593
—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	17.58298027302801
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	13.652007816753317
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	14.41815275598157
He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it.	9.472374295010125
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	13.135991706381914
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	9.617870347091182
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	17.613379489034955
Whereas.	32.13581597679176
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	16.072305666437007
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	28.351714473030086
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	12.598096858299845
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	13.128605523483154
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	10.852789480785619
—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	6.699102646065851
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	9.267289215056245
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	9.007878126002517
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.	11.618901024707057
I’ll pay you back one time.	9.985452152573703
Who’s that with you?	22.762885988608133
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	22.200156659062188
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	13.697324905332858
I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man.	19.039275252247315
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	15.821770831004928
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	14.784305845056267
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.	18.260836919275004
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	10.27107082394087
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	12.821951434186143
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	8.519461269934776
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	19.152635121202245
Pretty thick that was certainly.	18.795239156361173
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	19.0151308435429
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: —He is down on his luck.	19.734943645273333
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	23.992063124987308
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	11.270061034851715
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	9.469092841702249
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	24.513331196741323
—Half a crown, Stephen responded.	30.06527128901164
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	10.898481689318773
—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	10.38596901733556
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	14.257994785464778
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	17.147275119660417
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	8.263949392729772
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	11.69488948555788
Simply fag out there for nothing.	10.816315552279363
I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?	12.442973107675755
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.	13.86957468778267
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	16.384437957863113
Where does he live at present?	11.651512896425615
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	14.709838391430665
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	36.5854117426845
Why?	12.497976142926124
—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	16.069037809171114
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	5.932076240724051
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	16.912773654928195
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	13.441276817939954
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	12.282796098789023
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	7.8588178820497365
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.	11.314198364701408
But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	13.811939545247249
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	11.790207597383727
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	14.954214966625228
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	9.58938150536649
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	9.8869600341002
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	9.229991325772126
—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	4.443125267096953
Culo rotto!_ _—Intendiamoci.	13.809617097009117
Mezzo sovrano più..._ _—Dice lui, però!_ _—Mezzo._ _—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_ _—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	11.550199319064728
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus _homo_ already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.	6.535708992997897
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	12.871615836189703
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	5.501567202124242
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	6.144684248501181
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: —A beautiful language.	15.566097666762474
I mean for singing purposes.	16.282299278411987
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	15.790501157683146
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	11.090933938732604
_Belladonna.	32.13581597679176
Voglio._ Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: —To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	13.75655226501829
They were haggling over money.	7.818995613975376
—Is that so?	8.832425318126115
Mr Bloom asked.	7.759409689997601
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	7.125488432446294
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	14.653019210634953
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	11.65041937995735
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	9.86477818160487
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	12.641873249648164
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	11.529627300342437
Jesus, Mr Doyle.	33.785832920480686
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	10.004769267141597
What’s in a name?	12.023262236521434
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	18.83951825020041
Of course.	26.81664486411325
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	10.746054466858244
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: —And what might your name be?	10.268392267240541
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: —Dedalus.	13.765722623068749
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	9.043327854665197
—You know Simon Dedalus?	27.907048270810005
he asked at length.	14.75609366144611
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.	11.160912937629782
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	12.63920131862192
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	17.439171958011894
All Irish.	10.595029903244942
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	26.127623413168408
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	12.366719309370737
The lefthand dead shot.	6.791212737248195
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	15.920662107599455
—Bottles out there, say.	7.685897467893694
Fifty yards measured.	11.148858409578036
Eggs on the bottles.	31.480130803433042
Cocks his gun over his shoulder.	4.541961209551631
Aims.	32.13581597679176
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	12.64036108565963
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	11.911598377059889
—Pom! he then shouted once.	7.787353364491915
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	5.643407877490038
—Pom! he shouted twice.	8.711161284083339
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never will._ A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	8.514680291599442
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.	6.430220891268101
—Long ago?	14.786396833216765
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	13.632947642812207
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	14.029789337319249
He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus.	9.98466545748767
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	30.297470854642945
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	8.87291486440632
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.	18.151570094631268
D.	10.582866589593744
B.	10.122147751176978
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	11.148858409578036
Know where that is?	15.892856796291891
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	15.234285730834827
—That’s right, the sailor said.	9.564572530393757
That’s where I hails from.	8.584943798597498
I belongs there.	4.629492620734669
That’s where I hails from.	8.584943798597498
My little woman’s down there.	9.58868507676158
She’s waiting for me, I know.	18.20785612244689
_For England, home and beauty_.	12.280038152063756
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	10.696963623586097
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	15.768425746048928
Across the world for a wife.	12.882826610052192
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	8.061731373115396
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	19.66137410081905
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	10.73416522976457
You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	14.861903725251098
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	18.850704300668127
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	27.921164360850742
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	11.224679377600022
No chair for father.	5.336000317789429
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	8.776816025852277
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	16.971002056522636
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	4.187134863479256
B.	10.122147751176978
Murphy.	25.50621404370786
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	18.76064472015206
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	16.367403036183052
—Thank you, the sailor said.	6.300586695110207
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: —We come up this morning eleven o’clock.	13.254272232570536
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	4.340154301050649
I shipped to get over.	14.077801077955966
Paid off this afternoon.	12.765970384946032
There’s my discharge.	17.27047070606664
See?	17.685021073205338
D.	10.582866589593744
B.	10.122147751176978
Murphy.	25.50621404370786
A.	9.643960518690632
B.	10.122147751176978
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	10.420252059984465
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	23.556573622415787
—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	10.069608970400854
I was in the Red Sea.	20.04916197939831
I was in China and North America and South America.	9.115936328453571
We was chased by pirates one voyage.	6.439517246972131
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	10.118743080728589
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	20.280502209604364
I seen Russia.	24.75410958813549
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	16.58211792698403
That’s how the Russians prays.	20.65314110789845
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.	13.215642749881306
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	12.990134338512815
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	12.882717716191555
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	11.108068299500818
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: —Khaan! Like that.	10.514901714028937
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses.	9.925740572980073
Look here.	5.839984039894037
Here they are.	7.359930466275037
A friend of mine sent me.	7.006776217826687
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	9.990572494407967
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	7.7721879761004455
Beni, Bolivia._ All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	7.180916378993368
—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	8.654820270468326
Stomachs like breadgraters.	11.148858409578036
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.	12.624197380157407
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.	10.008885130162462
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	4.687707441584912
—Know how to keep them off?	17.820212639596175
he inquired generally.	9.70564496856689
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: —Glass.	7.860272695825347
That boggles ’em.	6.5220173728712325
Glass.	25.50621404370786
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	11.392064670112102
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	5.765430034259221
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	10.50235970746723
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	11.031095039286571
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	12.146318405892178
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	9.453393688411515
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	8.26183071063038
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket.	8.96612212935447
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	8.79822584673734
But who?	16.688409521161915
That was the rub.	29.801014863618605
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co. It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife.	10.455907011681493
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	9.563814627603387
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar.	9.438745024362278
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	14.021792965168354
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	6.29768673009229
He turned back the other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.	18.486234371565583
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	11.678300546144536
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	21.453540379556383
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	16.48928797077035
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	10.248403314869876
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	15.448338059939939
Knife in his back.	10.765657499401645
Knife like that.	5.720506772135133
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	19.99160940750752
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	11.678649191466382
Like that.	5.4945867608175005
_Prepare to meet your God_, says he.	5.406750553374312
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	26.029997857640062
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	5.541548540906279
—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	11.872066565895627
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	7.164594706105718
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	14.207728864454676
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	16.031939536665256
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B.	6.720906811119073
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	12.137673497247773
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.	8.814468574918784
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	7.1298790342086455
One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.	9.348616984129299
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	17.219445214656623
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	13.374537302375437
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	12.317018626353752
Give us back them papers.	12.851731304668599
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	8.086591051154432
—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	10.794391858171629
Mr Bloom inquired.	43.008670822138946
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	13.201625513436591
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	15.637012981816252
—What year would that be about?	18.178503326366652
Mr B interrogated.	14.734401266318299
Can you recall the boats?	15.175119130468527
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: —I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	9.38295881008757
Salt junk all the time.	6.753946675022884
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	20.465626761488114
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	13.24810549930692
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	11.352710381705599
And it left him wondering why.	9.540796816738302
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	17.244213006554272
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all.	11.675708136465667
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	11.387069761036885
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.	13.433158025473825
Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	24.61261354219777
I hate roaming about.	13.357656267807954
There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	16.470939408742343
—What age is he?	12.142588090559498
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	13.126104127466123
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	16.247335181594725
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	9.500413721362689
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	8.95166167016165
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	16.469111943696756
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	7.666918517240191
It’s them black lads I objects to.	6.7165100151428385
I hate those buggers.	15.388212525417071
Suck your blood dry, they does.	7.848502867484072
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	16.98909226438733
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	11.047156467333371
Fellow, the name of Antonio, done that.	10.469568999650512
There he is himself, a Greek.	34.08855793805561
—Did it hurt much doing it?	8.029703254951887
one asked the sailor.	13.570133583069126
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	9.824886527198316
Someway in his.	27.795496530527625
Squeezing or.	11.725328032605423
—See here, he said, showing Antonio.	23.269418063789303
There he is cursing the mate.	12.493531773931263
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	22.87684435226003
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.	7.724225630722213
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	10.81804259829448
He’s gone too.	10.902351182823727
Ate by sharks after.	5.2854087922740955
Ay, ay.	15.067810495928288
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	10.13936303976096
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	9.278062430812739
—And what’s the number for?	16.569985131011208
loafer number two queried.	7.124763581548046
—Eaten alive?	9.70564496856689
a third asked the sailor.	15.000131987061481
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	15.051931545949351
A Greek he was.	7.73885634873165
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end: —As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio.	10.606963905238272
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	13.610182997164902
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	21.908875354417066
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	17.285290669483707
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	7.609352376619794
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	12.16415076195482
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	17.726695095492573
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	10.904309002712559
—The gunboat, the keeper said.	15.098454684395929
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	12.047509951371653
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	12.420222814940326
Still no matter what the cause is from...	9.426761301145895
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	12.47922404356982
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	9.829091125783084
She is a bad merchant.	31.36868462189856
She buys dear and sells cheap.	6.391765266756602
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	14.772026281405008
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	9.912744799202837
—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	32.9508859547274
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	17.328627259938397
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	22.888646882414307
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	6.440841201658373
Do you?	25.98143100944099
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	16.40137077090604
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: —Simple?	15.085410342336502
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.	17.119682890171898
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	15.90112954152916
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	21.47960745066744
—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	15.164412937658073
—Has been?	14.786396833216765
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	16.84031073716356
I’m not so sure about that.	9.522199206795108
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	16.97800743218281
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.	12.171608476460799
Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way?	11.610045458258304
Let me stir it.	7.479298477040633
And take a piece of that bun.	33.11884199320456
It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.	26.653295828530975
Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got.	14.066232832267342
Try a bit.	9.592035450578392
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	18.929827908860208
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work.	10.29521018894101
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	8.257823043519315
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	15.217593181910095
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	15.118421171781781
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where.	11.568940790689762
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	6.8290008963849225
—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	23.820930117261224
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.	15.141581952475347
—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	11.674958344810188
You would feel a different man.	8.451440068343482
—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	5.975159643151075
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	10.880380140460517
I can’t look at the point of it.	12.069192241685375
It reminds me of Roman history.	10.121571738668994
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	10.424394554834784
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	14.272389218142168
Do you think they are genuine?	32.33367900862787
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	8.28981378141681
Look at him.	6.655114186182362
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	11.897541529880224
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	14.715103941532627
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	9.124593459633482
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	10.479029839057711
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	7.727223084392289
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.	20.46408441326423
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	8.548782914031337
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	13.448963064887936
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	11.1429509757563
There’s an example again of simple souls.	10.838591720447548
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	11.670489987476316
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic _de rigueur_ off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.	10.492189576870043
—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	12.144795511830647
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	21.57396739421816
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	10.734039058314018
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar.	8.678683084613878
She has the Spanish type.	33.607448541449735
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	9.478476904386337
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	5.209353696857807
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	17.965294077341323
—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	14.229549582089312
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	8.55639188197318
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	14.528578302879557
—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	9.46612638455013
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	10.955768817367884
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	8.714369867207703
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	11.731653385671281
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	5.962186178309365
You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.	9.131248203768386
An exception here and there.	5.177879019498681
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.	17.710792641198303
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	12.844517565384706
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.	14.032964980738694
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	10.291772254912834
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	18.383926553831436
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	11.121952332999058
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	12.967931958893303
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	11.47921561011177
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	18.110905210256092
s.	7.42724343932194
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	9.795199457150428
No aid was given.	13.887770929401979
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	18.47122174698686
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	32.182324130577044
At this stage an incident happened.	7.907914236519451
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	8.081171629368125
—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	13.19479384535598
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	15.419229857554631
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	15.3988842085235
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	11.468644489071938
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	12.867461825152194
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	4.9059207336864565
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	9.981844537539564
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	9.725082278981402
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	14.97075744249995
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	9.528689368434414
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	10.763814779781427
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	5.386844562576482
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	7.529750651571796
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	16.07444112358827
—Am I right, skipper?	15.476875600397344
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	19.54413334987717
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	12.767364250600577
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	16.52426022913303
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: —The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.	9.197206794032878
O, Johnny Lever! Johnny Lever, O! After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.	10.786301410743244
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	11.893548795353
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact.	11.008556212207727
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	13.420356005885932
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon?	13.502800177954333
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	12.921278216834391
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	19.09835630655184
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed.	14.824089633334724
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	14.477934002937108
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	12.243193689442416
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	24.26132946380828
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	16.53508518074209
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	5.330964617818624
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	9.808528556920297
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	10.92818956595322
—Who’s the best troops in the army?	21.226407509859264
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	5.636211105707435
And the best jumpers and racers?	15.487809167097836
And the best admirals and generals we’ve got?	14.98115905968565
Tell me that.	17.339509160463233
—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	10.235954875818102
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	21.916376166427614
The Irish catholic peasant.	12.116599241714928
He’s the backbone of our empire.	15.867244805843828
You know Jem Mullins?	16.69839072792987
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	8.4538822297113
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	12.44993169365879
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	11.39259432467845
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	17.590271923490185
Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact.	11.209047416985472
And now, why?	22.23633786697548
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	20.16340602271223
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	15.024091811544755
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	8.565780567492933
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	12.414854828884089
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	15.042797860187132
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	4.513984015381204
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	21.224449329441917
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	11.311794890979337
s.	7.42724343932194
d.	17.685021073205338
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	16.08562214582737
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	17.811415331067835
—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	21.317859383625883
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	25.346982688008733
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not.	16.995649531734166
That was one for him.	15.639509530921035
A soft answer turns away wrath.	7.3326503106833325
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	10.800937899886032
Am I not right?	15.353598628562402
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.	14.86059747590588
—_Ex quibus_, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, _Christus_ or Bloom his name is or after all any other, _secundum carnem_.	10.001312557146187
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	14.376965430007628
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	11.413610142540254
But with a little goodwill all round.	22.51970675441378
It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	7.8284475693814555
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form.	4.391559590708449
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	5.43781236310678
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	14.541492829599134
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	11.096124318373304
Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right.	8.90983051196069
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	16.56328124467315
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	20.376865175614626
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...	3.6410827208323764
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	10.519735003685858
—They accuse, remarked he audibly.	10.241676322474964
He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they… —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining.	15.543767518881184
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.	11.093406394330422
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	8.949849827548082
Why?	12.497976142926124
They are practical and are proved to be so.	10.193980763728284
I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are.	15.098156486192226
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	14.118669066050861
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	27.68542819307169
Turks.	32.13581597679176
It’s in the dogma.	23.90964337292435
Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think.	11.337253701083506
That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.	18.44707622708715
I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.	11.11010476174532
That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	9.614057574151914
At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth.	23.628765335721447
I call that patriotism.	22.994127018264223
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	7.170070114397427
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	18.481013976826446
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	14.213241317704428
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	12.229006182862522
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	21.29228820316488
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	13.71908932758537
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	13.968884666825016
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	22.999410787597796
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	17.442317664878303
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	10.434416133766979
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	16.160415925416498
That’s work too.	11.135217595040274
Important work.	8.425917152462297
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	17.164649386534084
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	14.690777863586279
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	29.024001423540398
Each is equally important.	8.55639188197318
—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	14.31886400965667
—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	26.731315818948616
—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	14.491557664543823
—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	10.375588559199489
Excuse me.	6.0596951333205915
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion.	18.268974618760808
What was it you...?	16.912135715577577
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: —We can’t change the country.	8.42627601859097
Let us change the subject.	14.582234446795157
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	11.601911015715933
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part.	8.265695676394735
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	12.633939648663445
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	12.580461078312021
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	12.763420891115882
For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	11.376398652803546
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	10.156284557679026
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	9.786786357252373
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	21.18097216045712
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	5.9655004308633215
With brains, sir.	5.0160674462962245
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	10.752495485281138
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	4.306719211671141
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	17.77159530129329
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	13.44019699358008
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	11.511367036444549
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	9.022191326811923

He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	17.596001414388855
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	13.083344186275838
And so forth and so on.	5.280891123583038
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	12.268372341818893
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	23.340647254679133
Something evidently riled them in his death.	12.991765104642772
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	8.426856017192566
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	9.24843430585436
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	12.42718447926248
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	13.91528012982371
And the identical same with murderers.	11.300601167487544
You had to come back.	13.63006599495356
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	6.3328470709254665
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	14.485050692529503
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.	12.6390149134103
Still as regards return.	6.186442684388578
You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	9.769871994179226
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	7.340794385750184
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	17.838295502128812
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	15.840538377226945
—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented.	21.675633728461733
She put the first nail in his coffin.	23.262539595135063
—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	15.073091375461493
She loosened many a man’s thighs.	14.548635659555863
I seen her picture in a barber’s.	13.829992463283656
The husband was a captain or an officer.	15.140184570182395
—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.	9.493392606309484
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	9.802852133111266
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	10.892518731996098
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	13.813240587476551
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.	18.496276379222774
The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.	9.402028584692827
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	11.065800453835
Poser.	32.13581597679176
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	9.648626320885583
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.	14.723225183135181
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	11.38313658821489
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	15.827440503525917
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	16.45726135448569
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	10.335746103650886
—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	15.200498540036598
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	13.450816495975037
—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	11.540987789510163
—Was she?	12.832642761022516
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	9.214166628917141
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	19.28161088305605
So, Spain.	19.541794883363302
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	13.099560100491653
—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	16.54574489925583
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	15.54084839765727
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	16.307207163167575
—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	16.151775062545653
Taken a few years since.	18.405417511941735
In or about ninety six.	6.775264498694619
Very like her then.	7.409418858644563
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	11.55163153143115
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	19.582315581758028
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	13.96091680551067
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	15.703738427372281
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	22.843324569708063
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	11.697016476725006
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.	11.216625096103819
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	14.627380369968623
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	10.362721541173691
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	11.826494848479863
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	14.451264741954498
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	11.510341199408721
Suppose she was gone when he?	31.54480008825825
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	11.62128364408629
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.	13.8574470385729
Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter.	19.546291849475214
And why not?	10.263848488642276
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	8.556384798187693
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute.	16.47220578171492
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	12.814356797881356
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals.	14.896650311694453
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	9.006628422281112
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	13.482237685533299
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	12.816879605520372
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	11.305172820384232
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	9.523110702756139
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	10.588389813170375
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs.	11.676246156651116
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	10.9953133929692
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	9.957356523504389
—At what o’clock did you dine?	12.115053129627299
—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	4.098065317492996
—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	9.742197368031789
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve! —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.	11.842650043434809
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	10.088773628920546
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	8.184848989217654
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	7.595890842757901
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	10.600836364789835
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	14.265371694670009
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.	10.19751647671809
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	18.000008153906556
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	19.188752926985025
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	12.913496492261366
For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	14.608758418140793
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	11.81854697873122
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	10.113347669838962
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	14.917210223036212
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	15.058634028390058
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	8.113383505586674
Your god was a jew.	9.15718151879414
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	8.901566310347397
—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over.	9.353832134271855
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	15.061881282525402
You can’t drink that stuff.	13.814159923082414
Do you like cocoa?	50.134138938769695
I’ll just pay this lot.	9.228363705364993
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.	12.520109695309669
—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	10.992248537711431
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.	11.66063632186433
An opening was all was wanted.	11.4499600098807
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	15.142654567484794
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere.	15.069063664812619
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.	12.408385611624771
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect.	12.253962468727286
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	7.477867120061671
—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	11.619439185363206
—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	8.912591489782086
—Are you bad in the eyes?	33.557069750872536
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	10.643696272657023
—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	15.193356796068342
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	7.342452394511494
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	18.793122858774446
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._ Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	7.18392093539644
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	12.00332472177873
—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	14.843346066501331
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	10.288577831983575
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	17.108588972886206
—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	25.194708949523566
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	18.587615347724544
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off: —To sweep the floor in the morning.	10.631046764822019
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	17.892287211546748
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	12.021725873395205
—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	30.784980432369466
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.	10.930373813333235
Come.	14.44968689830552
It’s not far.	21.155498130979247
Lean on me.	5.565886614062207
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on accordingly.	21.0403293537445
—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	16.18163074742367
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	10.061596412039636
where the municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.	10.734150397215107
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	10.568114393450475
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	20.15001404217028
Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s _Huguenots_, Meyerbeer’s _Seven Last Words on the Cross_ and Mozart’s _Twelfth Mass_ he simply revelled in, the _Gloria_ in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat.	15.269346233043983
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	10.937168367872516
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	15.384644549698898
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	13.9684372843605
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	13.91009468716912
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha, M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	16.958919497737114
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	10.463923458806386
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	7.6479610735377435
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	10.30516834206083
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	13.197732391243672
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently, jocosely remarking: —Our lives are in peril tonight.	11.081661612615173
Beware of the steamroller.	41.56510857572102
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	14.935879484336441
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up.	12.180890038826837
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	15.199032510052652
But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	15.994329191368868
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	9.022824517240045
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	9.070308565764385
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	12.170082094310178
—What’s this I was saying?	24.796285498102808
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	12.33576396683375
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	20.25546065589464
Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	17.432284591372202
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	7.702795832776182
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	8.909878152859864
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	7.610039995766468
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	19.59914997015895
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	8.543106029628742
A.	9.643960518690632
(a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you.	10.541448506498478
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.	16.63063965707331
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	14.483151211326419
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	10.088035232356576
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	9.853301843951554
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	8.316571319420285
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	17.123672722160048
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	11.72393238831611
In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.	11.618313131372219
The horse was just then.	17.194963301537033
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	8.043903267057269
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	14.591641012205915
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	13.025509782319775
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	19.800774212869232
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	8.55639188197318
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	14.409594009038388
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	12.09551168291045
[ 17 ] What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	11.387543208588067
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	9.334664370794638
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	8.020656735373311
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	11.683053831586994
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.	13.558278248248925
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	5.614562327598659
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	4.087205633260169
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	13.551929013777876
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	4.95813510474784
Were their views on some points divergent?	8.89367446668105
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt († 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree.	9.250526671256484
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand.	6.530156810663149
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	8.589328701370714
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	6.7374847270367315
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	11.450981154294944
In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	7.607544058811908
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	9.324826826016539
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	7.204428499177792
In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.	12.312822759170638
Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.	17.477906728170026
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?	4.286928776613465
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	8.18544599509155
As in what ways?	8.55639188197318
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	10.32772316830177
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?	9.316618508837614
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	19.621175195198354
Was it there?	21.343332757788534
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	25.188686228504547
Why was he doubly irritated?	20.067858598132485
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.	13.597142327810777
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	10.542215221835633
To enter or not to enter.	17.03675603238334
To knock or not to knock.	14.441694417563612
Bloom’s decision?	33.42591692570032
A stratagem.	16.58211792698403
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	11.33715412497969
Did he fall?	23.347709325769163
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.	12.084769495693338
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	9.755503171761253
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.	8.576141549939178
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	5.877689251470581
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle.	14.162899347924034
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	20.10605692876629
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	9.6670887057446
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	8.085657967469777
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	37.531522039583976
Did Stephen obey his sign?	8.665330132049261
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house.	10.419405174446638
What did Bloom do?	14.19037094277597
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	8.818739000459875
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	8.464769874657357
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.	14.206818798229781
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	27.335707038909046
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	7.731058430343814
What did Bloom see on the range?	31.292010813101072
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	9.957354899697917
What did Bloom do at the range?	17.927738823998396
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	13.169021750326735
Did it flow?	24.30950537123747
Yes.	9.732442163148734
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	8.438938817018558
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	11.528322643328272
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	10.209678499698624
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	5.943448723734051
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	15.298468161006516
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	9.29047390934808
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?	10.621418181365774
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	8.222925908750344
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	9.188881598367892
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	27.53753757513166
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	10.192317284324925
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	14.445772054621633
The phenomenon of ebullition.	8.55639188197318
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	6.435186734848103
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.	11.465011194979194
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	9.41994482785751
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	8.163698032081454
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	7.22310846290845
To shave himself.	5.44464915617882
What advantages attended shaving by night?	9.022174197008395
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	7.57411151125082
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	13.598331157136384
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	12.911673651502557
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	15.249314837584418
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	8.310143433958496
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	11.795653670340807
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.	8.196951912824332
On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak.	10.7692101384607
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	7.862257956440286
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	23.026134970433493
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 88 6.	5.366212421746418
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	11.779050239526187
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.	12.257901467212301
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	8.537790283929212
In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	9.986117968180471
W.	10.582866589593744
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	9.528500060494371
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	10.544625229564936
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	6.14633179370776
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	6.710072913307365
His mood?	16.58211792698403
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	24.156863272249993
What satisfied him?	6.254259529238606
To have sustained no positive loss.	6.954940221720194
To have brought a positive gain to others.	7.485256381407449
Light to the gentiles.	40.16581023621037
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	23.28442477095958
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	11.723198283536558
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	9.36968857411389
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	11.183701633470763
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	14.010610878667197
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	12.744651677391944
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	9.207517401923319

A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	19.174756441312013
Who drank more quickly?	12.116599241714928
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three.	15.852157059793583
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	6.14633179370776
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	7.165713994105885
Had he found their solution?	11.813874270124792
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	13.195527013870212
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	15.40005811387635
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.	6.5308946448292255
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	11.667209584821533
Bloom.	7.724644464000979
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	8.364150003235336
Name, age, race, creed.	12.954246225929937
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	28.568171061805018
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	4.67884218319456
P.	8.450228160453479
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?	11.468374218012768
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	4.016903790394205
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	6.7371352435989165
Dearer far than song or wine.	7.62545549803851

What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	5.183687693988006
G.	16.067907988395877
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	10.176811493076402

Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	8.286707730380781
What relation existed between their ages?	10.288111764400162
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen was 6.	13.738806633730738
16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom would be 54.	10.4106309992795
In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C. What events might nullify these calculations?	13.802180037312723
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	12.283903505999978
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	7.2932002806461975
Two.	20.244295502353957
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	17.061594294269245
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.	19.364037703613622
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	14.052656698093191
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	12.432209506260465
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	10.348795882365796
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	8.58284126471249
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	13.522096250288335
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	9.448080681863646
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	9.339822969858188
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	8.131891108282398
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	4.583555959996754
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	7.615607724027699
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	6.880088185848633
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	12.075949262910159
Neither.	32.13581597679176

He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	13.084369609174008
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	16.025153921810407
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	8.644629399677926
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	7.547975019291314
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	14.178169064157125

Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	5.855031324179796
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	12.04895972938173
Did they find their educational careers similar?	5.962186178309365
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school.	14.017576949424054
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	9.98739973049666
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	12.243072677451496
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	6.54486535488286
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	8.701344767030145
The scientific.	16.58211792698403
The artistic.	16.58211792698403
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	8.722093234219315
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	11.015421180511183
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	6.463727146013192
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	7.036010713604238
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	3.676411290748709
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	14.342768004993486
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	3.6758222866830987
James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	11.345523383021128

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	6.926666885176658
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	9.685255648448274

Queen’s Ho...	7.899022992748354
The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.	13.364222712409358
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	5.575764415884567
Coincidence.	22.281730317965827
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?	17.9815767332525
He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	10.367437808061927
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	8.864712811398276
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S.	5.146379928935672
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	12.052823303452522
What to do with our wives.	16.779282638446055
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	16.02463687628004
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	4.312354429332644
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	10.897287608201838
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	7.694177830360015
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	9.305196956436674
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	7.155512243537084
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	3.8678664306076813
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	6.191495639512811
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	5.676302383221476
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	11.325389266900578
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	8.39406924075934
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	6.693294993779759
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	7.0873988549211635
Variously.	32.13581597679176
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s ignorant lapse.	11.403782378957288
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	9.652158970479299
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	12.436148823774056
What system had proved more effective?	6.14633179370776
Indirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.	8.55639188197318
Example?	32.13581597679176
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	5.505385235826764
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	11.417230644119394
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	7.672317720751682
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	11.397978331147641
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	13.144029852820374
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	13.798854132715968
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	5.326674755210389
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	8.932614704516055
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	7.166775025238168
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	5.443991187882013
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	17.411723497959166
By juxtaposition.	16.58211792698403
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.	8.520727066878747
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	15.90006675333823
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	5.3234130097868455
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	5.148241554780201
Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	8.72673094275311
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation?	7.795324785425117
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	5.039775617670823
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?	16.29650416420509
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.	9.665333488276094
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	12.279932372064806
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	15.347829469089223
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	6.406922716292258
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	8.600873107736287
Did the guest comply with his host’s request?	42.116562065950966
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	8.558937405337227
What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?	18.71419481776592
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	11.041332690729032
What was Bloom’s visual sensation?	24.89551581377322
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	14.944844497564416
What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	12.800304511402375
Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	4.549988293319714
Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.	12.48109812726173
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	20.54184801798469
In the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.	6.599687161949538
Salmon, D.	6.623102603553433
D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J.	9.927218266254295
Dowie.	32.13581597679176
At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	6.929038589709491
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	9.43187563514977
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.	6.115120461897391
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	9.668914005695232
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	8.773699499689249
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	12.611122258513726
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	15.603109966798986
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.	6.581822296256074
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew’s windows all.	7.782053936729614
[Illustration] How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	9.279533621703449
With unmixed feeling.	7.554588130286805
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	16.289081361034455
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	18.508383192705498
Then out there came the jew’s daughter And she all dressed in green.	12.984255825436232
“Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again.” I can’t come back and I won’t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	11.760276649106325
For if my master he did hear He’d make it a sorry ball.” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	11.588676536536958
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	12.805165517601353
And now he’ll play his ball no more For he lies among the dead.	8.792072022167112
[Illustration] How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	7.491984879902598
With mixed feelings.	11.148858409578036
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s daughter, all dressed in green.	15.748102726415514
Condense Stephen’s commentary.	22.93441475284134
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	53.989114720378595
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	6.066239692468815
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	9.834402866969015
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	15.56407573812581
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	9.53567850487253
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	17.636538018357307
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	9.519956184227178
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	17.4165133943968
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	10.886086380938808
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	9.25414959674026
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	6.9517267433485745
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	10.114908661577974
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	10.805620137090123
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	13.323843931994144
What other infantile memories had he of her?	11.119048514981168
15 June 1889.	6.220389490562277
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	5.492088905123689
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	6.468582786390966
What endemic characteristics were present?	9.149780810610805
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	8.365909577610909
What memories had he of her adolescence?	14.281682804636146
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	8.120233597602505
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	6.426451450362159
On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).	7.686913117332912
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	7.074522678455854
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	17.36193556118503
A temporary departure of his cat.	11.959812599650322
Why similarly, why differently?	10.727138689141
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian).	9.985985980124768
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	22.097179008417903
In other respects were their differences similar?	8.159494687705322
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	9.669849897010817
As?	22.281730317965827
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	6.674507075979153
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	6.554779962235735
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	8.314864583852058
Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat).	8.170641139124907
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	10.94994407487697
In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	12.32970623752617
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	11.093218064003775
In what manners did she reciprocate?	13.576957220483393
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	4.500611053968356
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	9.7879759305825
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	14.464594983225743
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	13.876424158890972
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	9.40721801067837
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	9.559826972910285
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study.	8.238256581040357
For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction.	10.993713065453539
For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.	5.46647554893183
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter?	8.020644368924366
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	14.34870361352934
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?	10.017030918748933
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.	7.5715426942539565
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	12.115451958532791
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).	11.126327596434944
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	10.54429098402765
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	10.917094046013517
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	9.123475564029096
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	24.92457193415096
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	8.996768118413378
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	8.39255862211805
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W.	7.866465686161861
and E.	7.20859276391317
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	11.994315945261652
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	7.270351384829083
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa.	15.757637191069092
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	13.15763082444518
and T.	7.974602935354842
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	9.052871277544229
Was the clown Bloom’s son?	16.973289791701625
No. Had Bloom’s coin returned?	23.887744949637526
Never.	25.50621404370786
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	5.601129346659307
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	7.893372102763341
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	5.919585492768331
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	6.922958917890188
Why did he desist from speculation?	11.311172665313187
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	18.100427208071352
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	17.514594332741712
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.	10.266367388288401
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	4.933166236174795
Not verbally.	16.58211792698403
Substantially.	32.13581597679176
What comforted his misapprehension?	8.55639188197318
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	13.466010353640215
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	4.9859315882874355
The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro_.	4.715205923555985
What did each do at the door of egress?	14.73310855117261
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	10.308131891400645
Stephen put the hat on his head.	8.333756794589227
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	19.048001655032852
For a cat.	20.334231371935058
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	21.405326527509175
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	5.567700193220178
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	12.103661157614805
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	8.335313275016581
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	5.998289448020273
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	7.624479655911829
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	10.963595115887045
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.	12.846991918311222
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?	12.964013356359947
Of a different order of difficulty.	14.79422030558063
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	7.103073241225616
And the problem of possible redemption?	19.150971461596118
The minor was proved by the major.	11.9890724272838
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	18.065297409707384
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	6.550803085578419
Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	9.36319696126853
His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?	11.572229723268578
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	17.938525419779296
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	9.3429942845586
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	33.77818465854256
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	12.129324461298339
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.	8.1727367078428
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	5.934063825302641
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	10.109697110109183
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?	9.846642011292682
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.	8.189690081310198
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	5.924520536258512
Both then were silent?	8.55639188197318
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	13.902253198072694
Were they indefinitely inactive?	8.55639188197318
At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	12.743768770829691
Similarly?	32.13581597679176
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	12.601657606620494
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	8.991472405014253
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	7.002873864851209
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	10.248054003814149
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	8.141885800096073
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	10.48836187850656
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	10.649926507631278
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	8.10945149607284
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	28.139161345526787
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	15.54077089310138
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	8.429261946606573
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.	30.06168201151132
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	9.142060448762376
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	8.91853170352353
Turma circumdet.	12.212364007875731
Iubilantium te virginum.	8.9860352863664
Chorus excipiat.	16.58211792698403
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	7.615707246637526
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	15.223814955148178
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	9.852883031516019
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	15.742447827901948
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.	19.121542014179276
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	18.059778502278526
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	6.21821106267498
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	6.1912685826631595
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	7.390465779875179
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	14.6380945204103
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	17.09161287466719
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	10.601794175163626
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	16.570205805362036
Did he remain?	20.325361505222507
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	9.855179395524944
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	7.275726978967679
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	11.327824062741612
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	18.06904924221632
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	10.757072818541669
Describe them.	5.354180925719555
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	8.364976443622984
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	8.825767978272925
What significances attached to these two chairs?	10.179237375055513
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	15.082100990703115
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	10.683862123620557
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	6.775781255650014
Clifton Bingham, composed by J.	3.961949786177539
L.	10.990294469428525
Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	7.836430940200582
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	9.595143750920498
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	6.666564221791841
His next proceeding?	11.148858409578036
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	11.237249380570416
What followed this operation?	9.910497547215114
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	5.660696027029083
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	16.496416778073467
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.	7.077791422443699
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	5.86871177251527
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	17.555854741812993
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	4.990045009879246
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	9.112207705312066
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	5.437799526799397
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	6.365258792636126
Brothers and sisters had he none.	8.969689242840587
Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.	15.665035960011881
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	6.365258792636126
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	8.60493701024284
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	6.789726145113236
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	4.203187934869893
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	11.993457760948509
Catalogue these books.	11.148858409578036

He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin.	9.637356792748738

An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.	12.261599882022887
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	10.91839835100413
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	7.283872459983452
As?	22.281730317965827
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal: the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaton: the sanctity of the sabbath.	9.602137706721905
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	3.1391026135578524
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.	9.128383136947233

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresia, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).	6.282689722895407
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	9.228192817467482
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	5.587274920073999
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	9.631808513605998
What idiosyncracies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?	13.081849581839696
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	9.99139633361569

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?	8.235637163197007
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.	6.520046324279752
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?	10.147317535069595
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	28.77896179478347
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	7.616224232863644

Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1/4d in the £, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff’s man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella.	5.760270816985149

With which attendant indignities?	8.55639188197318
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	8.749833733417242
By what could such a situation be precluded?	14.854863083831946
By decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).	9.045939067434345
Which preferably?	16.58211792698403

The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	8.42311075942944

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	6.439517246972131
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events.	10.295922219570253
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	5.416924322424684
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	8.734282089818707
What would render such return irrational?	8.021899158659703

What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?	5.368973736301771
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.	9.471711472636699

How?	17.685021073205338
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	12.06074627443214

Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	8.159853287552084
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	11.10476655778564
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	8.393643166368072
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	7.255653542160594
Envy?	32.13581597679176
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	7.310054786877524
Jealousy?	32.13581597679176
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	7.926597632753996
Because attraction between agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	8.244029000614393
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	14.180678711767246
Abnegation?	32.13581597679176
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	5.696781357444721
Equanimity?	32.13581597679176
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	10.972359542747231
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	4.717484176931636
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	5.464024276374993
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	10.738430122215425
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	6.100488442658617
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	9.098981160510727
What retribution, if any?	23.774915177128022
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	13.369654000253714
Divorce, not now.	16.102585779152477
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	7.60853213840114
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	7.3326503106833325
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	7.315034723876344
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	8.338646014317334
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	6.365218130096125
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	8.03476840790993
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	8.68172663778212
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	11.931195504259012
Then?	32.13581597679176
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	8.835645520571475
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	8.68172663778212
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	10.211624231689118

What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	5.326688845215319

8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz.	10.49891044077475
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	10.561293639513853
How?	17.685021073205338

Where?	14.036610527842967
• [ 18 ] Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.	12.495160109704402
