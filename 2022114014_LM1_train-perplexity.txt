"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	13.770219211771762
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.	9.017385419133152
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	10.148729779740078
"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it." This was invitation enough.	11.006003330005115
What a fine thing for our girls!" "How so?	10.984372966681272
how can it affect them?" "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them." "Is that his design in settling here?" "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes." "I see no occasion for that.	9.498993601561802
You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party." "My dear, you flatter me.	12.655683515171008
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	9.386357644001396
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	7.744366369013335
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	9.661434750257191
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not." "You are over scrupulous surely.	10.227498702627967
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy." "I desire you will do no such thing.	12.103316184409492
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	13.327571452504841
But you are always giving _her_ the preference." "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." "Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	13.123795660737835
You take delight in vexing me.	4.471353491387791
You have no compassion on my poor nerves." "You mistake me, my dear.	10.270207874748248
I have a high respect for your nerves.	15.700983714129656
They are my old friends.	6.634682140070414
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least." "Ah! you do not know what I suffer." "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood." "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them." "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all." Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	10.859556228577622
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.	10.025915615213078
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.	15.405614239988935
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	12.25813376190352
CHAPTER II.	6.822487150374098
Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.	8.472623688085834
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	8.627474532631926
It was then disclosed in the following manner.	17.16401975077521
Long will do any such thing.	6.682615003511601
She has two nieces of her own.	11.446443711424553
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her." "No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you." Mrs.	11.134242295270157
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	12.460748880827493
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves.	7.976822224233519
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?" "To-morrow fortnight." "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.	10.006739404869316
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself." "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_." "Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?" "I honour your circumspection.	12.898755220549361
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	11.962067587924953
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight.	12.630617320751814
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.	8.701779139203015
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself." The girls stared at their father.	13.406502325932053
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!" "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.	8.70039366731427
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense?	13.823238999231123
What say you, Mary?	17.940215814275096
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts." Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	13.481223088550717
"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr. Bingley." "I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.	7.460682764865583
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	17.326718786616542
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	12.161423370503849
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	11.950040952741096
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.	9.29327832328069
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now." "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	11.663848342142261
"What an excellent father you have, girls," said she, when the door was shut.	11.727072695409724
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	12.07431040407604
Not all that Mrs.	5.121010847746395
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	11.71366686250449
They attacked him in various ways; with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas.	8.55384281956482
Her report was highly favourable.	7.474630493755546
Sir William had been delighted with him.	10.399984193841474
He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.	13.318479626598222
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	9.263629800545125
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for." In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	14.814241187137444
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father.	12.284283246458042
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs.	11.002062741259515
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	7.880295356068091
Bennet was quite disconcerted.	20.244022231745998
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	11.99357907776233
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	11.663749010674572
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	13.600287028814193
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	11.14050484185277
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	6.390850957695416
His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	9.974173793231646
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	11.657394171841915
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	4.536181698548413
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.	7.188331897841576
Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.	10.616696408226765
His character was decided.	8.010724163485635
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	14.36753427603595
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	9.909498041333922
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	6.234370208452689
You had much better dance." "I certainly shall not.	11.264803106984026
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	13.405107462878847
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	13.76109400033406
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.	12.417830576700743
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me." Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	16.641980583241875
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	8.062425772888918
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	13.080486351151537
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.	11.840207852274158
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	13.534081226217422
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	15.186185355100006
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.	10.842277802173955
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	11.022738085863176
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	12.974491211546441
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.	14.373012896443466
I wish you had been there.	8.377804230992952
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	11.4459483815091
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	10.662430447882853
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	15.704596972272034
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.	13.927657199110639
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	22.374353631237746
Then, the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the Boulanger----" "If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners.	11.418936894031244
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!" "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs.	6.925697487444307
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.	6.849218421571738
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	7.624958997026716
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.	4.614315470557175
Hurst's gown----" Here she was interrupted again.	12.773263545858327
Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery.	10.042573927788375
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	7.964119096456492
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	11.718576785120709
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	11.22428382250586
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	10.354412848153189
His character is thereby complete." "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	12.151147489860445
I did not expect such a compliment." "Did not you?	14.253751859686682
_I_ did for you.	4.667416888908899
But that is one great difference between us.	7.726853882136468
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	11.36974082399854
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	6.8242234716175885
You have liked many a stupider person." "Dear Lizzy!" "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	11.621709158213852
You never see a fault in any body.	10.028686779698084
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life." "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think." "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	9.008610296060285
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.	6.146305326184847
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.	14.75773624775462
Their manners are not equal to his." "Certainly not; at first.	10.791694607805868
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	8.121502279990844
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table, nor was Mrs.	9.868662155851895
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	9.404841363797717
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	10.552464797448122
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	13.157474946137235
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	10.948831557530108
On the strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion.	24.050348860252033
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	11.50622937315565
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	18.19273905152785
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	11.776138318888593
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	9.689004211174
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic.	8.035184545172054
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	11.478518255199893
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	11.81549260092788
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	15.901360122615054
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate.	9.652737872476306
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly.	4.175261855132902
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; and quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world.	12.028230802467508
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	8.780788313314718
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.	5.5362340165219
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.	9.312328842074855
Bennet.--They had several children.	13.408750456748443
The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.	10.392555835488896
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	13.554391996023055
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.	7.563349629243583
"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice." "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better." "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.	10.440578265441333
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson." "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	10.849282339144574
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	14.581992314453402
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_." "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.	15.13977316202113
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips." "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to." "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	10.358573924724924
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable." "I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	3.359391906464434
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	9.715114761045763
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	10.38237267137951
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you." "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him." "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	8.67602006089287
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	12.463407614164655
If I may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud." "That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_." "Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe.	10.416780119681881
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	9.464812299915527
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	7.687118406154166
A person may be proud without being vain.	9.292347592506257
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." "If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	13.464105915282097
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day." "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.	7.675735297631734
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly." The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	12.97988260464196
CHAPTER VI.	8.01744683224889
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	7.85950398704706
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.	15.527768795618082
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.	12.453696383588374
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	14.437291714593899
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.	8.187499781466604
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	13.716317535457042
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.	9.437167349796248
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	9.0393202708237
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.	10.531446400540403
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too." "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do." "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out." "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	11.590208524349434
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	8.442851626532201
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses." "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	11.906860213090894
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	14.218592298295425
She has known him only a fortnight.	9.870931941163136
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	12.449044439565181
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	5.651676912318186
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	10.245008945053591
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life." "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	10.635338472287248
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself." Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	12.240682856646423
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	11.133375710597996
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	12.00283434108574
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	14.965861269720271
His doing so drew her notice.	4.089727568144833
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	14.806603436394168
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?" "That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer." "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.	12.022801952098224
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows." "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song." Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	12.688505779809924
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	15.910317779396443
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	8.088967932225097
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.	10.220331054650776
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began.	12.08907992486969
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies." "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance." Sir William only smiled.	9.379522850774178
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	9.380716248585655
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour." "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	13.560627196064884
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?" Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	11.171991392775343
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley, "I can guess the subject of your reverie." "I should imagine not." "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	13.516022360916919
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow." Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	11.467352589559823
"I am all astonishment.	17.520963294983176
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy?" "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask.	9.962375057660827
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	8.01081562161404
I knew you would be wishing me joy." "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.	11.707557742702532
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you." He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	13.693985999505573
CHAPTER VII.	7.331239552044485
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.	10.570137289315984
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	9.751278090505124
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.	17.880075499400803
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	11.295210335554172
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	8.872597634601702
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.	14.6778558106219
Their visits to Mrs.	3.259913241128198
Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.	10.40901824346838
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.	8.847100798714525
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	9.690642883400615
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed, "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	10.710545210743375
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced." Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	12.127308666557502
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs.	4.509520391052883
Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	12.226816231631988
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however." "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it." "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever." "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	12.237681004871725
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals." "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library." Mrs.	10.695244286699129
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	10.038709476620877
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "Well, Jane, who is it from?	14.81501344247448
what is it about?	23.614134087774907
what does he say?	5.931826896964479
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love." "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	11.139415668939527
"My dear Friend, "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women can never end without a quarrel.	9.837338413213542
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	9.739727052983502
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.	19.432268306443756
Yours ever, "CAROLINE BINGLEY." "With the officers!" cried Lydia.	10.919850210971399
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_." "Dining out," said Mrs.	10.184598632729829
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night." "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home." "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs." "I had much rather go in the coach." "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	10.253353250342329
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?" "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered." She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	10.460611451636938
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	14.113689888901595
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	6.039231293656114
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	12.213766891352169
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs.	7.094219651739548
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	18.169413286046645
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: "My dearest Lizzy, "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	9.280560339198953
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better.	9.016020238148723
"Yours, &c." "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders." "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	8.746916871700169
She will be taken good care of.	10.252458739731091
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	9.801783642529589
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage." Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	17.886628105177433
She declared her resolution.	8.740974528644578
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	12.734636910966623
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	10.350438444179709
I shall be back by dinner." "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required." "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	9.623930769239786
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes." In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.	8.967661553343682
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	6.603556046949758
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	11.056628342222838
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	13.167310965863944
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	13.691161893478387
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	16.793914484662977
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	12.771684721387679
Elizabeth silently attended her.	5.589656837083418
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	11.538522746039348
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	9.20402988297304
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	10.417062021123458
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	12.335756997761637
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	10.396579781899781
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.	11.008603256288385
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	8.733783990805037
CHAPTER VIII.	7.331239552044485
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	5.507685243209865
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	7.35796257543725
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	8.996329352696492
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency.	16.65903933915548
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	14.671936199041884
She had very little notice from any but him.	7.340763251550806
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	14.39477921359206
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	10.642582284019458
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	13.6516734790761
Hurst thought the same, and added, "She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker.	24.227937577092295
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	7.860977467798053
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold?	12.446351845717501
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!" "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office." "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.	8.121484866642584
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	10.31820550064675
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice." "_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition." "Certainly not." "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	10.102369661237177
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum." "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.	10.576514575507378
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes." "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	12.08636746121766
Hurst began again.	4.000110631705897
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	12.468048814222971
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it." "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton." "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside." "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	8.819390901145006
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable." "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	9.572023808879477
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	8.464899494693572
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	12.607113959012693
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.	11.519419030567079
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.	10.864478375775015
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular." "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.	8.37446815246557
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else." "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things." "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well." Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.	10.821126537238602
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!" "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations." "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books." "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these." "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.	10.40283218892026
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley." "I wish it may." "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	11.327729682693807
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire." "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it." "I am talking of possibilities, Charles." "Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation." Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.	10.433053257183815
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller." "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	9.596970862770267
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	4.124328809486648
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished." "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth.	10.62815199211638
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse, or covering a skreen.	7.047622098650208
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	12.58998887237551
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished." "Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.	11.242142421949266
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved." "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading." "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	10.619870635675648
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_." "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?" "_I_ never saw such a woman.	10.420625511752533
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united." Mrs.	12.024782685626436
Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.	8.906840335826418
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	11.838820124754294
But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art." "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.	8.810707259267373
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable." Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	8.892380565373106
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	17.550188490295742
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	9.736231861267143
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.	12.828065587450116
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.	15.031991360963373
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	7.941802503460392
CHAPTER IX.	7.331239552044485
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters.	17.713184782684188
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	12.814299055232427
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	17.23552543778028
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	11.136075691701745
She would not listen therefore to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable.	12.032523148188885
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	10.220578468728714
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.	3.5205881978493863
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	12.267661548864856
"Indeed I have, Sir," was her answer.	15.315526663990225
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.	10.889760736619577
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.	11.137806460295593
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness." "Removed!" cried Bingley.	9.151762497770472
"It must not be thought of.	15.911709769017381
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal." "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us." Mrs.	8.80213022872484
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	14.831317863545529
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with.	12.206818915841554
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.	7.670223504190448
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	9.13578397555385
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly." "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful." "That is as it happens.	9.810314438411831
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society." "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever." "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.	6.602007368513036
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	10.037397617707834
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town." Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	14.748790838815559
But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all." "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	12.634509276210267
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	8.155499208982226
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true." "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	14.321242683763783
I know we dine with four and twenty families." Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.	10.762070748523628
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.	10.752035540140753
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	9.032791801714811
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?	13.628818003976216
so much the man of fashion! so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter." "Did Charlotte dine with you?" "No, she would go home.	9.586854334550154
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies.	11.274062863862438
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend." "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	8.727955881274891
"Oh! dear, yes;--but you must own she is very plain.	15.635804038456248
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	11.685924925780842
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking.	13.948214347274195
It is what every body says.	17.865401691963935
I do not trust my own partiality.	16.18669449690464
But however he did not.	5.673788292413561
Perhaps he thought her too young.	14.785571645313837
However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were." "And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently.	14.62798343658457
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	16.67493161787602
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	7.277890525121059
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.	7.846704571875179
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away." Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	8.856040761896253
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	8.944583461325195
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	6.809528406894751
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	13.895111188445824
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	18.726493971497494
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	11.041205526319136
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	9.689486596477709
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age.	9.549663600029398
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	11.630283642414648
She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	10.31151297997566
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	8.612357550885994
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	13.574512913054486
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill." Lydia declared herself satisfied.	12.158215177002205
"Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.	11.005641100669589
And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.	10.53658332925914
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not." Mrs.	8.310132907084924
Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.	10.973173454006329
CHAPTER X.	7.331239552044485
The day passed much as the day before had done.	12.280769992302634
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.	11.983914015920794
The loo table, however, did not appear.	12.882831555207641
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.	8.753299051191043
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	12.745024859536912
Hurst was observing their game.	4.983494528588811
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	10.985611515139254
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	12.728953943483054
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!" He made no answer.	16.626990457885242
"You write uncommonly fast." "You are mistaken.	9.686766492678334
I write rather slowly." "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!" "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours." "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her." "I have already told her so once, by your desire." "I am afraid you do not like your pen.	8.566635399667911
I mend pens remarkably well." "Thank you--but I always mend my own." "How can you contrive to write so even?" He was silent.	8.921337667547292
I shall see her in January.	25.240050990482956
But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?" "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me to determine." "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter, with ease, cannot write ill." "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother--"because he does _not_ write with ease.	11.088830098438782
He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?" "My style of writing is very different from yours." "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	8.237472704713019
He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest." "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents." "Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof." "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility.	8.062137986781737
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?" "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	9.763161309158273
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	12.193018913600332
When you told Mrs.	3.267995348229141
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?" "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	11.971542566364004
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.	15.473514562806782
At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies." "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity.	10.163087204526056
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month." "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	12.315526831444561
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself." "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	10.665928952535655
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could." "Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?" "Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must speak for himself." "You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged.	9.26168207422116
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety." "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you." "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either." "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	12.595006679209822
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	6.090406978619782
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.	12.356725638668799
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	9.141607785830335
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?" "Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?" "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of.	11.45186368860044
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	11.739789090242464
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	10.982903357982627
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me." "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter." Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	13.995665319286887
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	16.3367226047889
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.	10.065128572135853
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	12.503431911939842
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	8.69594073005798
The supposition did not pain her.	6.5938540623754935
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.	12.229267489261977
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her-- "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" She smiled, but made no answer.	13.596937995874848
He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.	12.304223866218656
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	12.803603228889466
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	12.195738499875844
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare." "Indeed I do not dare." Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	11.522225851239284
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	20.029696190757612
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	13.202333748143891
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	11.730747530995338
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses." "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?" "Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	9.129006942918572
Put them next to your great uncle the judge.	6.387951591228369
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	13.068751737565236
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied." At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.	10.893394716615157
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.	17.837405146967313
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	15.812500697792233
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.	8.355072980159175
The path just admitted three.	5.502224050465728
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "This walk is not wide enough for our party.	10.526466069196674
We had better go into the avenue." But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	10.62617713395622
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	7.02123913664039
Good bye." She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	11.06833730552889
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	7.819204530900533
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room; where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.	9.695926845274181
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	6.4123748045265225
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.	6.0637934687622055
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	15.561889436521081
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	9.830717240512346
He was full of joy and attention.	10.049528971569195
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.	10.566852528483787
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	11.311051997005835
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	15.824891103240903
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.	8.366506379130362
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.	8.647226839201078
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	12.318552138361499
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	12.029429339211063
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.	9.395647210178478
She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on.	13.07361325779369
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure." "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards." "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	11.267285495744307
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day." "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball." Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.	9.498086953644137
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	15.077130672475716
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said, "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude." Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	11.136453354345422
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.	16.97537117648019
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	11.649761552369755
He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing, that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere.	9.436276043096845
"What could he mean?	12.973390618792648
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	11.785187818282152
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	8.891392125119719
"I never heard any thing so abominable.	12.502764928048151
How shall we punish him for such a speech?" "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.	9.469186943779228
"We can all plague and punish one another.	4.86702749787118
Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done." "But upon my honour I do _not_.	15.781769572635692
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	9.548601058249398
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	14.096930079118854
Mr. Darcy may hug himself." "Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.	13.721801627165345
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	11.267216730130158
I dearly love a laugh." "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	7.8459021306760715
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	8.913130499944765
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without." "Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	8.803860660664435
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule." "Such as vanity and pride." "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	7.30580800357708
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?" "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	9.621206526742881
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	18.10651374670416
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	10.208235040233337
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever." "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.	6.586267884237084
"Implacable resentment _is_ a shade in a character.	5.389721327704678
But you have chosen your fault well.--I really cannot _laugh_ at it.	8.257376066384614
You are safe from me." "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome." "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body." "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them." "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst." Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	9.615340551992517
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	10.539860177974582
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	15.69164538124026
But Mrs.	2.507592810299147
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.	11.52043354277651
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	11.003445456216328
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	9.761375823121165
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	11.470999348782453
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	11.784775276302927
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.	8.533616615735548
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	9.720055129550252
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	12.463049786088122
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	13.109868530778146
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	8.953876238823613
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.	9.195061168892748
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	16.71848849117292
Much had been done, and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.	15.22728871671566
CHAPTER XIII.	7.331239552044485
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party." "Who do you mean, my dear?	10.568774916291481
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.	7.645794578938293
I do not believe she often sees such at home." "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	9.939393442137984
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure.	8.736959705105798
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	8.554364455140487
I must speak to Hill, this moment." "It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life." This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	11.532967784899103
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	10.116731065354495
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases." "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	8.301789734185007
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	12.968433350642519
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it." Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	10.883520492267193
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	8.705604101957851
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	8.414941983340668
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	9.726859602892926
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself." "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.	17.354306587350845
I hate such false friends.	5.660586572884754
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.	9.233807593118355
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	7.7231336781031334
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter.	14.83047616273217
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	8.618168962715075
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again." "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him." "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit." Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	10.904906117941128
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.	13.433409634530342
"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?" "No, my dear; I think not.	10.959352317865232
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.	9.453418464423152
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed." To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	11.191712866815987
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	13.674073576026517
As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	13.482715787384514
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	13.100837771954811
Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	9.613603043063296
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	8.940634318259947
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	5.238531317039936
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	11.615512567151292
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers, but Mrs.	11.929677955277006
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	11.361191854164604
Things are settled so oddly." "You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate." "Ah! sir, I do indeed.	8.64034919727789
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess.	14.56907579853343
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	13.743436411520843
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed." "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	10.754560397432613
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.	11.025494691858823
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----" He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	12.536940565982473
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	8.7721317021479
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	15.92055140333949
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	11.454903672004667
But here he was set right by Mrs.	4.808251179864062
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	17.249994576839224
He begged pardon for having displeased her.	4.897597563459539
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	8.115848554428602
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	14.822654367144402
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	11.30579026765499
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine.	10.945480164365302
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	10.643164611258015
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	8.575386989058092
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	9.878809355678314
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.	5.23473860470645
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	10.240999788594323
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	8.249234279526727
Does she live near you, sir?" "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence." "I think you said she was a widow, sir?	9.30321586157222
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls.	13.997955366237955
And what sort of young lady is she?	10.200181521279712
is she handsome?" "She is a most charming young lady indeed.	9.646743306666249
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.	12.671672545333438
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments, which she could not otherwise have failed of; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.	8.517959821504625
But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies." "Has she been presented?	10.231720436561643
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court." "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	9.580880336981046
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea, and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies.	10.478952998001182
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?" "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible." Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.	9.908121843561878
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	13.122550811034053
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	11.275601120283497
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	12.156077332352016
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	9.415783622797406
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	12.29897884417298
I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town." Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said, "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.	8.727079239327027
But I will no longer importune my young cousin." Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	10.999181575340714
Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.	9.091913217083174
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	10.388957650965272
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance.	8.990955475275902
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	9.648635524525885
Having now a good house and very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to chuse one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.	11.542208645493703
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged." Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.	14.801971621030596
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	10.870455718961967
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	13.553971008729336
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	10.605929482502413
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	12.518248930685857
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	9.711853829753402
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	15.672247117862074
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.	8.832265688179891
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.	12.707165496617431
The officer was the very Mr. Denny, concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed.	12.323989040508115
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	10.072379211493747
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	12.429636024053812
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	17.289055243173163
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	16.751827766055996
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	7.757589666725618
On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities.	11.880137467999855
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.	20.289590007419562
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	14.44674884240471
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	14.09954179681196
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	10.26353768740175
Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.	8.182290522010643
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	5.542363087713491
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	7.63300761019454
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	11.58227278957847
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	12.636682233868388
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	10.96638049651042
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.	13.157312300083296
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.	10.180773243784827
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.	11.938021823004354
This was agreed to, and Mrs.	12.438622889619628
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	9.926376144841651
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	7.834394913784105
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	7.908430234101123
Philips's manners and politeness.	11.521532359368212
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs.	9.264155564167476
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	10.143094273291199
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.	10.364332912551701
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	11.151073629445644
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	8.916199657753735
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	9.481717555369318
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	14.744762429274623
It was over at last however.	22.247347894580404
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	11.36916656246407
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	9.742683465604305
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.	10.108548578815755
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	11.144527705983595
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.	13.492475042390462
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	11.365043225520626
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	9.196919569210865
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	14.342241585456428
She dared not even mention that gentleman.	9.200001648159422
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.	12.84158471530463
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.	8.190590670961013
A clear ten thousand per annum.	5.957274268496198
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy." Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	10.417213621933207
I am not qualified to form one.	9.309295746877643
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	11.13016153626946
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.	16.92505138868114
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family." "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	12.20797293676516
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	14.383757219856452
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	10.439432779812778
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen." "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.	11.95912607439298
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer." "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	16.079558009397243
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood." "Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	11.687000432864247
We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world; a sense of very great ill usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.	12.151122271714149
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	18.086481773489943
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	15.50182445234623
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	14.45274466041924
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	9.51269801672906
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	13.902423408673938
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	14.86967173128698
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	15.38245063587627
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now." "Indeed!" "Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	12.516042862814999
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	9.682557540286558
I cannot do justice to his kindness.	12.08546573472341
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere." "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?" "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	10.437730928819041
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	10.534244468727152
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	12.777898317893003
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.	14.054072667985196
I can recal nothing worse.	10.324054023969266
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me." "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced." "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	12.6604416277918
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_." Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	11.009773425751106
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	10.721382475117114
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me." "I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!" After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.	11.423491214168545
His disposition must be dreadful." "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him." Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!" "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	14.308289477434865
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.	20.662946004822594
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	28.25349009474061
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself." "How strange!" cried Elizabeth.	10.356480680832934
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	5.928804763617244
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride." "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "Yes.	12.391820219079289
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	10.769096796256918
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.	18.95476075230739
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	11.880562220333035
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.	7.996251543554014
But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	21.792841225798835
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	11.884445557327588
Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education." After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying, "I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man?	12.72438113750476
How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr. Bingley?" "Not at all." "He is a sweet tempered, amiable, charming man.	8.57612292472686
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is." "Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	10.98543364956401
He does not want abilities.	13.605464455728873
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	8.159229200591282
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	16.482588470491834
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure." The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.	8.564640594017797
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	13.685115726776031
It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs.	8.098739302328061
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	12.991807294580875
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	9.876834889233193
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters." Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	12.547183527351601
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.	7.2034817206190835
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday." "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates." This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	13.252859088252306
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.	8.853095014047852
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman." "I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.	13.406668720319097
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class." Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	9.923307723614684
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.	7.968756389603597
Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully.	12.567224112335659
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.	13.989840106151757
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	10.825366947961413
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	9.064617747144336
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	10.937861621105066
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.	8.972294204855237
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	5.8547093947151545
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side." "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody." "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	10.826666662164323
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible.	15.39212457517962
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	5.04191263466218
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	6.642397382880982
oh! no." "I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	9.039548451694243
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.	12.00079972432769
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.	10.213374569458662
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.	5.770477531154372
They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs.	8.278705127911007
Bennet's civilities.	17.207248105507663
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	13.747924143520228
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	10.19672614613452
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	10.558524405389468
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	10.213800613893039
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body." Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.	9.069950000340983
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her." Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	11.798580894670266
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances:--and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had been never worse timed.	7.9072345525464245
There was no help for it however.	15.01672254556074
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	7.962752190203095
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	9.842055105487278
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply.	11.859757047617489
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	13.441661715511396
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	8.66694939081317
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	11.895065114042083
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here." This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.	12.856593066620894
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.	9.24661401153173
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	8.391438104326507
Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.	6.313453238696224
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	16.383676484314506
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	9.055191970664994
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil." When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	9.95480848785948
He replied, and was again silent.	20.30934154722553
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with "It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.--_I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples." He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.	13.763540517629814
One must speak a little, you know.	9.698266949208621
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly." "I must not decide on my own performance." He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.	13.317681242426783
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance." The effect was immediate.	11.119157932491053
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on.	10.172708550872665
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain." "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life." Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	15.72991917396229
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	9.072426520034504
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	15.866376727769596
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.	9.839980596654371
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.	23.28578736674972
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	10.53817685462123
What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.	9.380839411126534
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of." "I do not think we were speaking at all.	9.197215730390411
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine." "What think you of books?" said he, smiling.	11.173736091969683
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings." "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions." "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else." "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.	10.638914163473297
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	14.454190969975718
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" "I hope not." "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first." "May I ask to what these questions tend?" "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.	9.60754639195966
"I am trying to make it out." "And what is your success?" She shook her head.	11.921490220220463
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	13.88877885857085
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.	14.260766068583399
Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has been always remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.	17.9409222119241
I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.	12.002981990112655
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better." "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself." "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	13.941818510232206
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant." "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	8.94038136996353
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	11.334641220980213
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	9.683581422627547
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	20.966078319267893
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon." "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	9.657422488883068
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	16.126240760515667
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard." "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?" "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton." "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	18.564007863406204
Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before." She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	11.643752310143258
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	10.291822666362204
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	13.403984831197247
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	11.958610201347243
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.	9.589670548755102
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	10.740184437029702
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	19.002670837695682
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	14.107899779370879
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	12.0571696365591
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	10.218962278034379
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	10.041031158981616
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	14.238592823981762
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.	9.300915512775948
Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.	12.566730866343017
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	11.664573791821832
It was really a very handsome thought.	15.085650596666788
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	12.001941115594814
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	8.60827920233722
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	10.101287203772
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	10.271572861127316
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	13.750997558337076
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	8.195789760044079
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	11.309382176281511
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	4.264800413245099
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	15.406526207144198
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear." "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing." Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	13.167405253124377
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	19.13510901808712
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	4.357000086487952
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	20.847945665908906
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	7.900729972574463
At length however Mrs.	4.530139592638093
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	10.755470983046159
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	11.730752459265426
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	11.825938686802417
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.	13.387160727145998
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	10.191142686619902
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	7.491926323992835
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child.	11.64557200687829
You have delighted us long enough.	9.546787987464137
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit." Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	16.557814319409808
The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	11.088782855058458
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	10.463929161963218
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	13.291795030958246
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.	8.687913789622561
She was teazed by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others.	11.507822157619763
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	12.90524150413551
He assured her that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her, and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening.	13.917379522616637
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	7.957885599830651
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	19.238004992751915
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	10.765887936585564
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.	8.626883173375088
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	9.14712910101418
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.	2.8434194141895266
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	10.91948760288843
Darcy said nothing at all.	5.473841250042694
Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	15.957308111761927
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	15.145828197590637
Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.	10.76352486404361
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	12.356859711717595
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.	10.431512206796016
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	12.763128316847814
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	13.934549608658536
On finding Mrs.	2.7309583981100913
Bennet instantly answered, "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out, "Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	12.50016389289718
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	12.477985840688852
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.	9.201322897462667
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	8.565444054887271
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	8.038453759721552
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did." The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	9.583329817157251
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	9.733436467743386
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.	8.77785003801807
This is my advice.	13.232621978742129
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	13.165897125648641
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	10.673005299245228
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I assure you there are many amiable young women.	8.79376075448488
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	9.65479891016201
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	11.468073611905655
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.	13.69227913892283
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	14.149233068920669
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married." It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	8.76586751562821
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.	6.905219046315374
"You forget that I have made no answer.	14.059081792735984
Let me do it without farther loss of time.	7.813243708442105
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	8.743500077264747
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them." "I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.	10.05184125889478
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	8.274202421288779
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation." "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.	13.612833608068206
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications." "Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	13.158519716042665
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.	8.733086983135047
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	11.601107904821362
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	9.370488618166897
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her, "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character." "Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.	12.270567114895647
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one." "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course.	8.621057782936907
My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	8.80093305907719
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	10.736054753266401
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females." "I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.	7.957447533802473
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	12.030699776007861
Can I speak plainer?	9.653219000625503
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart." "You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable." To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.	10.107031549132852
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.	9.800444044825797
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	10.141713195857811
Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	10.890451381663633
This information, however, startled Mrs.	5.797451421237683
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	12.006673612482336
"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason.	8.397243568758775
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	15.508220101462523
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it." "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	12.890971866237363
Bennet, alarmed.	29.259335122830315
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	13.956068739780925
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_." Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.	14.64039255704981
"Of what are you talking?" "Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	9.61505087496318
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy." "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business." "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	9.778055876528319
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him." "Let her be called down.	8.442667110708205
She shall hear my opinion." Mrs.	5.467115711451685
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	10.94940511894027
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	13.582331392086633
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.	7.433916034619659
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.	10.748352814026148
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.	3.856260191803851
Is not it so, Mrs.	8.175379979085978
Bennet?" "Yes, or I will never see her again." "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	10.4260927114552
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_." Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.	8.450385585563609
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	10.840300076603679
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him." "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	7.181182546218621
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	16.230374974297504
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be." Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.	15.279854873743618
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	9.68601623634299
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	9.088224031758845
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	9.06487313451128
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	10.758967683134426
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	14.75209579583706
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him." Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs.	12.202535282951157
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	12.246759298009207
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves." Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	9.305925419081563
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.	6.250695314966904
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.	11.259369948956019
Those who do not complain are never pitied." Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	6.750553016386184
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together." Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	14.060760336584439
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	10.754144159280896
You will not, I hope, consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family, my dear Madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.	9.249746640357419
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	6.677294077221786
But we are all liable to error.	7.312747147054582
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	12.549948524481819
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise." CHAPTER XXI.	12.026624921493257
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	8.672528933138297
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	10.46445311147638
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	13.894590159010539
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	2.247407344838897
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.	9.2097553955574
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	11.961948517752456
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	11.027009385574495
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself." She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	13.5312797149699
His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.	10.258769024295864
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	11.175842225139672
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	13.770653697931305
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	9.594180329129525
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	10.552721013277965
You shall hear what she says." She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.	13.546167024882243
The next was in these words.	15.322417625021908
"I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence.	10.872849091420038
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them." "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	9.542520539630072
I will read it to you-- "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	13.00910855509478
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.	15.442656641768265
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you." "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter." "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_." "Why will you think so?	9.54847918631709
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	20.843174755186862
But you do not know _all_.	11.293175267109005
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	4.197984636572755
I will have no reserves from _you_." "Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.	14.10000930464719
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	9.195046740165969
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.	11.948798831740229
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it.	8.950211342426735
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?" "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?" "Most willingly." "You shall have it in few words.	9.873915141477122
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	13.813157591644046
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you." Jane shook her head.	11.90745796615716
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	14.213951728066831
She is not such a simpleton.	40.46457551584895
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	13.45618866051432
But the case is this.	16.110313304865393
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	12.290686123905958
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend." "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	9.565925571558816
But I know the foundation is unjust.	16.353109901612253
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself." "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	9.591486093266974
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	12.69869764206331
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer." "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him." "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate." "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion." "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.	9.908339992262393
A thousand things may arise in six months!" The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	8.107128742313565
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	9.140266953393505
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	12.1640412288627
They agreed that Mrs.	2.8701157803785162
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	13.366531443240362
CHAPTER XXII.	10.969192385311041
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	6.527319412846067
"It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.	11.885024024209812
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	9.42365476630944
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.	11.654448802338361
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	11.364998510603849
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	9.96124676044202
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	7.611252690143143
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	12.642317325468259
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature, must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.	8.435659895790968
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	10.182576064354649
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's.	9.994175883541816
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	9.193450895990772
She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it.	3.8416656235679305
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.	9.981798670038978
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	11.10737401155767
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	5.44365463359729
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	10.75503319499175
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	11.29901736858813
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	12.62179056790228
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	8.480656756585056
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	10.967961189407092
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible." They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness." "My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence." "You cannot be too much on your guard.	8.93589720285342
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence." "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	10.760870290180293
As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth." With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.	9.584940849214023
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	9.343711841178452
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	12.09416879179642
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!" The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	11.75973878190869
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.	11.484408983142194
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.	17.449851466858103
I am not romantic you know.	8.825253632411837
I never was.	9.910816301620162
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state." Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	10.549057474651923
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	10.48032065055058
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	14.957718711829019
The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.	7.503182553082999
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	9.130181417539474
CHAPTER XXIII.	10.969192385311041
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.	9.289270335950015
With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.	9.805267041731314
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.	10.217705283172583
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	12.174478271895536
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	17.216057358746387
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	10.063098369404305
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	14.114096108229878
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.	5.8904797848108155
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	11.188604030448442
Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.	8.905467663425481
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	10.101256911011173
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	9.65563249782332
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	11.26689834565468
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	10.736409997711549
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.	7.280121298696842
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable.	9.529893396348834
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	3.227013594515405
Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.	12.968653564848799
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.	5.128955249025506
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	9.224499293358635
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	17.659156038051588
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	11.18803505642566
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	14.561044185728159
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	15.003431412093569
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back, she should think herself very ill used.	12.367093703871
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	5.555554082690532
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	11.405713217193599
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	14.610934492057023
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	16.262273099167935
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	23.597345993400403
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	10.618255143443475
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	11.905276854966425
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	11.220855002028456
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!" "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	8.491813168848225
Let us hope for better things.	5.08098729843467
Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor." This was not very consoling to Mrs.	7.5444648356537005
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	17.039955625661648
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it." "What should not you mind?" "I should not mind any thing at all." "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility." "I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	12.9602849354854
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?" "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.	10.428084391223

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	5.197242770495181
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	13.021475442766441
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.	11.378874408728192
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	11.162671757715643
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.	7.085412022798851
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	15.634771050844405
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.	11.038957981691047
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	12.51335526747705
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.	9.066458465614216
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.	13.881555715776576
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	16.388471107262397
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	15.077667690036037
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	13.468949522272661
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	8.786342835716264
But I will not repine.	16.43422469730946
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before." Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	10.61680049933299
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.	13.327232776984753
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	13.779455127911856
Thank God! I have not _that_ pain.	11.021049164606664
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve." Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.	17.110168448968853
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.	8.585835483842388
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	16.55940768153463
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	7.15705436860953
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	11.916825211224978
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	13.55915507495313
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.	11.280581554031697
It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	10.046475183708
They will ruin your happiness.	5.330353769383371
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	7.817047971159467
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	11.35124406687195
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin." "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.	15.494527961521326
My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	10.926286397729598
You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness." "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane, "and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together.	6.999474308111946
But enough of this.	8.979238856203354
You mentioned _two_ instances.	6.413928786688236
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	6.464415619491074
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	13.638215792270145
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	8.34645642377017
Women fancy admiration means more than it does." "And men take care that they should." "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine." "I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	11.397776646718883
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business." "And do you impute it to either of those?" "Yes; to the last.	12.370910650025447
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.	13.71032758694441
Stop me whilst you can." "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him." "Yes, in conjunction with his friend." "I cannot believe it.	8.120091780361584
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it." "Your first position is false.	8.934106369858947
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride." "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	9.641598038141781
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	8.492301071172733
But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's.	9.54380111559433
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	10.913642965123895
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	12.676894673238158
Do not distress me by the idea.	15.184319383600448
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	14.162681574340855
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood." Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	12.687536631060562
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	9.416598598537576
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	12.662776125358196
Bennet's best comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.	12.602068087385696
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.	10.030867128412071
I congratulate her.	4.762682036470471
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	15.058099493399215
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.	11.998370558299683
Now is your time.	10.38649198217361
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably." "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	9.607450320995264
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune." "True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it." Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	9.463843478387183
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	13.969822254785424
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	8.767924625044875
CHAPTER II.	6.822487150374098
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	8.570296168906376
On the following Monday, Mrs.	5.709274845153132
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.	10.88931039405508
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	11.633627249824352
Bennet and Mrs.	4.333517694858728
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	18.49181411420046
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	10.112027136425716
The first part of Mrs.	6.340445700590879
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.	13.617882534163963
It became her turn to listen.	10.756839624979989
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	9.360175547195436
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	11.956470634138858
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	12.815859291842422
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	10.7974095514609
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	8.205842828378282
The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.	7.070887677380999
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	19.942531596022402
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	8.487136025278714
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves." Mrs.	9.265034128580607
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.	14.776779310339421
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	9.382764988781169
"I am sorry it went off.	6.581270529217115
But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent." "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_.	9.697225005407327
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before." "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	9.221479532618302
Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's love?" "I never saw a more promising inclination.	7.997613386917215
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	8.485080124145094
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	8.355081633372492
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	10.659434676472538
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	11.288467416814758
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	16.258692888621336
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	7.242668866650944
Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything." Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	15.498667191027412
We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her." "And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it?	10.300936422650123
Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him." "So much the better.	8.74092256715785
I hope they will not meet at all.	12.02345639197568
But does not Jane correspond with the sister?	15.931709321314319
_She_ will not be able to help calling." "She will drop the acquaintance entirely." But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	11.034079384841634
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	15.840223599630056
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	14.962328363336484
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	11.643575470130347
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	12.673861633196488
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.	6.848187831868083
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	7.2363502512030475
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	15.655169713082017
To Mrs.	2.8849486137780103
Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.	11.878324145547497
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	13.103637880504005
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.	18.70868629680642
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.	9.834921782773492
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	7.498738324323341
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley, with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.	12.592993404897024
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.	14.73477125160763
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.	10.282102042062423
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	18.2366510561362
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	12.639376121230397
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	13.332948230126938
But as it is--you must not let your fancy run away with you.	12.73556868210813
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.	10.407842715484724
Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure.	6.897144820092954
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it." "Elizabeth, you are not serious now." "I beg your pardon.	10.70347279381594
I will try again.	8.254462227110688
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	16.153168476167423
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	13.060387193946719
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	6.1342207606877635
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	15.150305605350216
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	9.948305211924431
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.	18.39572579920371
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	10.116438300090234
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	15.302662084308588
In short, I will do my best." "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.	15.630441267641446
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him." "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	10.065027370832171
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	11.380685329226754
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied." Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	13.906310695920409
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	14.406263265496802
His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.	13.408132353235066
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said, "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza." "_That_ you certainly shall." "And I have another favour to ask.	11.52716553570195
Will you come and see me?" "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire." "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	13.048939520102172
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford." Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	11.147057048192318
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.	10.209916783419265
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was.	11.039063274362045
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	13.152051679520822
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	8.54504767725041
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	16.299131604105888
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	12.865565088448124
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	16.63618222631122
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is.	7.31171040825105
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.	12.07693046940115
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street." She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	13.034207532661485
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	14.727172657322434
I enquired after their brother, of course.	11.932335452991794
He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy, that they scarcely ever saw him.	37.665807463777504
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	13.149199762516371
I wish I could see her.	7.07491753386816
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	9.511025815099918
Hurst were going out.	5.776919471998485
I dare say I shall soon see them here." Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	7.533869057372423
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	16.590578210724697
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	11.115671520658212
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.	13.899804934214094
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	16.695653087091316
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	9.960339750643948
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	9.436111150735973
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.	13.59572979863934
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	14.361930628059541
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	9.161547675423456
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	11.83769077524784
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	13.832689530437234
I cannot understand it.	7.7458452794137465
If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this.	10.9632485945554
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	12.736506789008693
Let me hear from you very soon.	7.76268191134934
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	15.953612698609112
We had better not mention it.	6.477771089088773
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.	8.303089307089508
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	16.048541310191027
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	10.264235060068602
"Your's, &c." This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	8.054654623725856
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	14.938789943883688
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	11.50904823990304
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	8.783541204120759
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.	7.893050972495388
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	6.5249555681528335
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	9.288811792100534
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	12.371952321814577
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	12.339642714122531
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	6.193791447022503
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	9.179014633188013
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	8.27121247347972
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	15.68038043627035
There can be no love in all this.	7.266041305049307
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	12.023610921942176
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	5.090924751039487
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.	8.293388158976407
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain." CHAPTER IV.	14.43251889543834
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	6.8448227281158385
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.	11.71136156196028
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	8.283961979573538
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	9.589368142518714
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	12.79152900250802
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.	17.728586582635582
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	11.368636565988536
Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long.	9.825131171604543
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.	10.124154199420776
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	10.059160000453334
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	8.68036592067808
All was joy and kindness.	6.192870459371769
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt.	10.671530306362452
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	10.157415424253239
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	12.518888236818984
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	8.470449859682683
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?	8.924698700390659
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary." "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	8.631752149356151
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	8.381578378890756
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary." "If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think." "She is a very good kind of girl, I believe.	12.189366483939143
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event." "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	9.914412494110861
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?" "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	9.26265434759048
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish." "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	14.225955287365677
I am sick of them all.	10.53728210572339
Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	8.432115462177071
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all." "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment." Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	9.78350771250438
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	7.320672930373333
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes." No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	17.59654532000985
"My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.	6.994649806229412
What are men to rocks and mountains?	5.512910405368119
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	10.272525141881571
We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	10.707219554000423
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	7.309337881459859
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers." CHAPTER V.	6.675845455579145
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	11.845692517350768
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	13.260774305752342
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	4.781851078526132
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	15.090340434246283
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	10.167189907564676
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	13.984639894567584
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	12.166894627032343
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	13.201394933170576
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself.	11.460509285240931
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	10.999088196232325
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.	6.018593753551032
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	11.768286329621217
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	11.531275668791872
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	9.345681945268158
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	9.85542142199403
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	10.655759052836316
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	8.232187947808155
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	13.280002303190006
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed, "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.	11.616316977762608
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	10.892573931641516
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.	8.939674232337694
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	15.941075197713896
We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.	8.723737155781357
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	6.332040232520575
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several." "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour." "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	11.76022963311527
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference." The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	11.307501381067143
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.	7.884698361673295
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	3.3089003796294643
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	10.705552438923725
Make haste, and come down this moment." Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.	9.81101967017406
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.	5.959629223636557
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!" "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.	13.090354419279894
The old lady is Mrs.	3.018936279861128
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	7.692495555305837
Only look at her.	5.2155914634112435
She is quite a little creature.	25.484593994326634
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!" "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	10.476577564853727
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in." "I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.	10.481641709708354
She will make him a very proper wife." Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	17.534120359864975
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	13.584122759083701
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	9.371705688282717
CHAPTER VI.	8.01744683224889
Mr. Collins's triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete.	10.53929625061467
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	12.224144203219057
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.	10.360016890198962
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	15.959705340433256
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!" "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	9.084888826497096
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon." Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.	11.488218512630763
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	11.539513302519179
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth, "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	7.760276975934027
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	7.526201035607905
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	10.685287922946687
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	19.49057884859198
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved." While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.	10.80095151426437
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	9.015912347441802
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank, she thought she could witness without trepidation.	9.615542100609355
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	9.514402073037452
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	7.253464613769057
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed, by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look.	11.795070817404408
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	12.29616637991158
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	13.234504737173484
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	14.060373153029497
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment, at her being so thin, and so small.	18.99742724176371
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	9.205643168480933
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.	9.753661034851492
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	9.65632311747084
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	10.343312414881032
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	11.317389189111731
The party did not supply much conversation.	9.276629390422247
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	10.898398125156588
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.	8.722487988414514
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	11.604938227796245
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	13.00219862646797
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs.	7.04429003757302
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	12.86955281762477
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	10.824018419663183
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed, "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	13.047353993502062
For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?" "A little." "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	7.219929903985618
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?" "One of them does." "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.	11.039856700132264
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw?" "No, not at all." "What, none of you?" "Not one." "That is very strange.	10.120332738923583
But I suppose you had no opportunity.	17.181543333411984
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters." "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London." "Has your governess left you?" "We never had any governess." "No governess! How was that possible?	10.964544843474437
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	9.56259267581763
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	11.42873011431686
"Then, who taught you?	10.951499716376707
who attended to you?	13.55967164018292
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	12.89391765343148
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	9.613150992721065
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	7.954516667023257
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.	8.677937728207038
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	10.974606838765803
Four nieces of Mrs.	2.75150611760123
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	8.980579526579072
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	11.70810826857768
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	4.193045656607717
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" "Yes, Ma'am, all." "All!--What, all five out at once?	9.73863300833873
Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?" "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	9.587770005047256
Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company.	10.122362811155156
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	9.453677651393223
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age." "I am not one and twenty." When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	11.69175704257941
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.	5.906791139901233
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	8.110767644135308
Jenkinson to make up her party.	12.068173546664763
Their table was superlatively stupid.	5.502224050465728
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	6.669645518835807
Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.	10.199108703496007
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	9.99796159884595
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	11.702132575159489
Sir William did not say much.	18.12081036328405
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	7.701706613841205
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	15.150566773007249
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	10.652153695740795
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	13.275503914963764
CHAPTER VII.	7.331239552044485
While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.	12.486915664231834
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	11.983372486287578
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	11.27818067487403
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	9.615666721803068
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	13.705411234799584
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	11.551713456243498
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	8.978174258739532
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	6.8473713122933555
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	13.015170583238064
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first.	9.304592884984658
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.	12.129253577595897
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	12.18260302471361
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	9.374619434759893
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	10.20099832586406
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	11.80696525793345
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	12.737102710102427
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.	7.112619572902263
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.	6.721388545075701
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	12.783799128159817
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	13.871421528581102
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me." Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	10.121508234985665
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	13.787692902577005
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.	11.160884739565214
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	17.250239289498214
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	6.08966804503788
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.	9.077274522666851
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	9.849901162777952
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.	11.27401620557582
Have you never happened to see her there?" She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	11.00904292960111
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	8.866871759409282
CHAPTER VIII.	7.331239552044485
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.	16.313613870967284
It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	10.310663870108883
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	13.044241884951337
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.	12.929440235291015
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	11.020823429044368
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	12.514947413495017
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	5.775664287705628
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	14.14925542964575
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	11.040774392413422
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	4.635617701122509
It is of all subjects my delight.	13.377675446274457
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	22.69893122857841
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste.	10.297295282747044
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.	15.550577214880443
And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply.	11.136939558700746
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	13.85560181014985
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	41.52653155869707
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal." "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	10.730058907516938
It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account.	15.07444983238774
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.	9.532449367019135
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs.	13.973366299434531
Jenkinson's room.	8.185051635994046
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house." Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	20.667588213996577
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	13.336969736907617
He drew a chair near her.	4.106391998002774
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me." "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own." Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	11.167619178211023
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	12.669792164091605
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear." "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	13.759812501068506
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam.	12.030002283459972
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	19.183441488774008
He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	7.053148382696236
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	10.857159701693499
Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party." "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	17.77005486950627
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	11.948657175828327
My fingers wait your orders." "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers." "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	7.011066440744849
They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression.	19.654002627893828
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.	14.5299781547925
It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution." Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right.	10.520531958769784
You have employed your time much better.	8.059240643846662
We neither of us perform to strangers." Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	11.273718893905935
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	3.965078094716619
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy, "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.	13.277633693143839
She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's.	10.563228447895346
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn." Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	11.553963713451157
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	7.098182192457258
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	12.226067669420159
CHAPTER IX.	7.331239552044485
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.	8.495578691745061
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	13.007727558501447
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	14.220259424879647
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	7.807177610783578
But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle." "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers." Elizabeth made no answer.	13.49621443595049
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.	14.01642015849342
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford." "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object." "Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife." "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	14.114868493929476
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	9.91178771685258
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her." "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends." "An easy distance do you call it?	11.421730736004745
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance." "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.	8.692690277908532
"I should never have said Mrs.	5.685777252747482
Collins was settled _near_ her family." "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.	9.715819777933191
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	10.744755799788745
Mr. and Mrs.	3.3307406594046864
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance." Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	11.438092433255798
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn." Elizabeth looked surprised.	12.186273414857752
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "Are you pleased with Kent?" A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	9.953368369918929
Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	10.017516092964172
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	12.619264273285713
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way." But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	13.255492569280351
All field sports were over.	5.7866240003197476
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	12.940344298550173
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	10.511514793113818
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	14.050500871879112
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	15.768035099501516
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	10.521362441988648
He seldom appeared really animated.	5.502224050465728
Collins knew not what to make of him.	8.86134539236992
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	15.515087834671021
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	8.834608613471879
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.	9.811549588823707
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.	11.226803939570768
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	10.336765446742456
CHAPTER X.	7.331239552044485
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	9.414889457981984
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	9.06826776182926
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	11.006530092854954
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	16.675536641898727
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	11.41495313220255
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.	11.102588282087106
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "I did not know before that you ever walked this way." "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	9.868475655472254
Are you going much farther?" "No, I should have turned in a moment." And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.	9.475356726785696
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	6.872769063189321
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.	10.658825958010933
But I am at his disposal.	20.429779244383035
He arranges the business just as he pleases." "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	12.159456971702271
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy." "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	10.48524141157052
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	11.805207062389494
I speak feelingly.	12.983804633224713
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence." "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.	8.669340000209166
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.	9.547965791889993
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	7.868921600697758
Younger sons cannot marry where they like." "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do." "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money." "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	11.01048828927451
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	10.1556438845212
But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her." "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me.	11.032823122215959
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy." "Are you, indeed?	16.747686647265333
Does your charge give you much trouble?	6.439855455133819
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way." As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	10.512075767781923
She directly replied, "You need not be frightened.	10.456140452172054
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	7.537659098629461
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	10.16767312728088
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	5.535460567588088
I think I have heard you say that you know them." "I know them a little.	15.983272247547758
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's." "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him." "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	14.604932080183625
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.	11.306627143309619
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.	14.367963085426643
It was all conjecture." "What is it you mean?" "It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing." "You may depend upon my not mentioning it." "And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.	10.831248798892357
"He only told me, what I have now told you." Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation.	10.978888997303942
After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.	10.659394091969522
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	11.694309662498283
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case." "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly." This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	12.641671819265762
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.	10.606105106438614
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	12.738913534687537
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.	10.772357776181718
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	11.000161942349395
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	14.273036391810372
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	10.651186102914837
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.	14.193239647604734
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.	13.171116395854185
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	8.735697758350147
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	15.91635684538679
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	15.042655623323993
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.	12.229518824410436
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	4.82614308515574
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly disposed towards every one, had been scarcely ever clouded.	13.60866269319266
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal.	11.145734380151925
Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings.	32.10287092133025
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	13.623757338075894
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	21.193594930968423
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	17.444850406734606
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room.	10.68454932617726
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	8.500403803635551
She answered him with cold civility.	8.836640307109432
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	8.517093306307482
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.	7.9892722019215325
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "In vain have I struggled.	14.310608359236678
My feelings will not be repressed.	9.903152228270178
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you." Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	8.349132012073655
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.	6.252291218888987
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	12.777023319230782
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	12.414403420127465
His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	12.293468331405395
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.	14.747433693543739
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand.	9.69819806316448
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	12.156357185451304
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	7.037638499782364
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	15.212557861348763
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	13.607079521144767
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	10.242597544818016
It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration.	13.861360210935544
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	11.576218366023422
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	9.318534558345222
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.	9.707616412014278
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	11.503003649208503
But it is of small importance." "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	12.700177674830377
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	6.337951563200793
But I have other provocations.	17.941811589240046
You know I have.	29.27165804928636
Had not my own feelings decided against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man, who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?" As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued.	10.431127255389711
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_.	3.7684543178526035
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind." She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	10.901074098599953
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	7.216744297516715
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	10.88336785065932
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself." Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	7.373825160937376
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.	8.688862597440306
On this subject, what can you have to say?	20.96388486879875
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	5.942223773375886
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?" "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	9.459388757645497
"You have reduced him to his present state of poverty, comparative poverty.	12.676925254434881
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	9.852099272244802
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	15.876957816264829
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule." "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	11.34764012942251
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	10.22626671359821
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.	7.836172163682418
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	15.507699999850088
They were natural and just.	12.494595894312633
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner." She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued, "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it." Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	14.301055065607759
She went on.	8.079229159650808
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry." "You have said quite enough, madam.	11.614557225516842
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	20.95076698916638
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness." And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.	11.446812722818171
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	10.469361134827547
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	6.418605909118268
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	3.822203013744554
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	10.97739790413431
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	8.513444433891792
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.	9.907891311161755
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	14.952660984868846
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.	17.523070521746565
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	15.120708961984086
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.	22.468688909770627
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	24.701760111862164
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	10.900305265493921
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.	12.2756586345153
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	7.871568495188016
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.	11.448306704168344
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	11.541466796454317
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	7.653584965450297
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.	9.640833819582708
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.	9.98975227701166
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	11.507507237128092
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther, that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.--He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.--The part which I acted, is now to be explained.--His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--I described, and enforced them earnestly.--But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference.	12.737420648128639
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	12.060915749188032
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	9.13216179310397
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	17.332587212845848
If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.	13.032874091196431
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	12.093260900745086
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	14.220090257806298
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.	14.792175127156323
The vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	11.770145310109193
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.	7.107914754161356
It adds even another motive.	4.983494528588811
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	11.692786359154814
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	5.563794588789284
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	13.325101156923429
I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	15.412104801708951
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	11.599370392339967
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	6.460723347591246
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	11.390708634074663
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation.	14.151688664756673
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	11.99606190038027
He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	14.341303489152617
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	2.991254300017223
After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	9.2762300662424
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.	7.796183627670521
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	13.51164305663991
My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	12.732645517216556
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	13.4270800512967
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	13.969287237493907
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	7.83295478251927
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	8.618376526442047
Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.	13.601503842984513
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	12.497983917211254
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	7.821200119900664
This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.	9.120582676389224
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	13.778815305435666
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	13.214799154674978
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	10.806602603032985
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY." CHAPTER XIII.	6.717989834426298
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	9.852557061713531
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	11.136698709060688
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	13.110420411956943
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	12.15214335731154
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	26.550836577713625
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	9.01732337399317
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	10.951965237065137
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.	6.9246624702276
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	12.283245663472435
So far each recital confirmed the other: but when she came to the will, the difference was great.	9.609777266999783
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	10.882636880106968
On both sides it was only assertion.	11.60047740487247
Again she read on.	6.461062488723486
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	9.048307400610312
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	12.474345513843344
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	17.340359448824024
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	8.024989371570314
But no such recollection befriended her.	4.589853428717462
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	13.18852479920005
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	13.762849548946177
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	11.318987669936647
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	13.103904449224649
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	12.532297132396954
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	10.527880253734434
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.	9.50181955293116
She remembered also, that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal, it had been every where discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father, would always prevent his exposing the son.	15.6285060257485
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at any thing.	8.40884256176691
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.	10.154421463139293
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	11.098756296152686
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	7.5785833902245905
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.	8.559682081880153
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.	9.631892081397973
Till this moment, I never knew myself." From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	16.540920336678415
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	12.689324024075052
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.	13.404075467006841
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	16.51785842158578
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	10.876812933460835
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	11.658155100767319
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	8.782577479159734
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	12.376881155304668
"What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.	9.14102837372709
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	9.392755877717104
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are.	14.067225668610387
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases." Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	20.64238823054147
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	17.667319708422514
Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure." "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday." "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks.	13.229153024545282
I expected you to stay two months.	9.13697380986147
I told Mrs.	4.681924757911756
Collins so before you came.	9.150357068871232
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	6.659675974231562
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight." "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return." "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	10.745226170679466
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	10.51161094449455
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	11.177799485968809
You must contrive to send somebody.	12.373796160605979
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	10.189691541644098
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.	15.764757667020401
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	6.2787303123808815
Collins.	13.007228064570521
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone." "My uncle is to send a servant for us." "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	9.401473158754113
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.	14.226108177352375
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	53.613010138389
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	9.013812565975222
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	14.4149319637903
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	7.522867416723934
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	9.685288491190231
They were hopeless of remedy.	11.278640179324128
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	14.211170867887015
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	9.718621007439447
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	13.72293914397398
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	16.2201069429979
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	11.010129624192238
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	9.457419211889926
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	12.126034820039633
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	10.701949486955135
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	8.351485265461427
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.	7.169613719108375
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	11.508097216395425
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	10.822600132809136
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	17.13558971856984
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly." Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	9.758901223481656
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.	13.106058601758905
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	10.633948803044586
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast.	5.151722620867297
You see on what a footing we are.	10.365784577588828
You see how continually we are engaged there.	7.417510692660092
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings." Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	12.360693692400785
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	10.291698695015123
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so.	10.41785991731672
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	7.959970393621781
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	11.20824325614848
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	8.701493689822984
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	13.784323019290065
We seem to have been designed for each other." Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts.	9.706827765482128
She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung.	13.568599877728987
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	12.62286650421022
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.	9.723540920614303
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready.	13.631117129294827
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.	11.257597820648035
Gardiner, though unknown.	21.788143201502297
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!" "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	8.224547212104474
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	10.484089657081894
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	17.942745722109578
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	11.98453584413966
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.	12.153577821841376
is not this an agreeable surprise?" "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	9.972648398272963
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	10.390523059050352
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better." And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.	11.429963585379882
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight." "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	10.146810271428537
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton." "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table.	10.206404937722988
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like." Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	11.92200588459729
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.	10.788947475455704
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	8.391044404610646
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	17.770568493727495
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	10.35797923222228
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	18.420068883058505
Wickham is safe." "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune." "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	9.86065713606949
"I am sure there is not on _his_.	14.15545151248549
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	8.059799899717627
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?" Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	10.30351377156223
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	6.676428423897823
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	9.69044476381733
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.	9.95823928380569
Have you seen any pleasant men?	8.61111866856577
Have you had any flirting?	22.37762836558647
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	14.330418656809357
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	14.195532435125049
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	7.957831970238002
Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.	13.093660016550759
Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	10.600136170184335
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	7.6794404502417875
and Mrs.	2.545416978344298
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.	16.99298452659749
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	5.514859651002852
Forster.	18.7596690870173
I thought I should have died.	10.047646210041686
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	9.088841014741758
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth, "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	9.212250613072849
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	11.384699054571929
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	10.812445826895022
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach.	11.227139371434035
I was ready to die of laughter.	13.519983648672499
And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that any body might have heard us ten miles off!" To this, Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures.	11.02233076723464
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	5.8182477445522185
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	15.487361022598368
I should infinitely prefer a book." But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	9.80330728436219
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	10.708871514357133
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	17.801807519924786
There was another reason too for her opposition.	11.485269789408395
She dreaded seeing Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible.	10.752602558731477
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	10.798789708668293
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	9.537062551769584
"His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong," said she; "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment." "Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.	9.741153485274827
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?" "Blame you! Oh, no." "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham." "No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did." "But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day." She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham.	10.25729304484052
What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.	8.351754163743303
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	27.119499257726456
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.	7.326252988738633
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.	11.747341568158037
"You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing.	13.665922485169691
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	12.177992115748534
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse." It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	18.188485863453845
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she.	7.888057607235609
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.	8.673024358830128
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	10.913225689547534
Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing.	13.42212260871573
I am sure you must feel it so." "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	11.246502552434057
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	8.81363219234268
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather." "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner." "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	10.067749656278776
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it." "I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do." "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	6.937576328664262
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	13.353278495599852
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty." "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now." "Indeed I could not.	10.51958180688642
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	14.585626045486062
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!" "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved." "Certainly.	12.623511711724543
There is one point, on which I want your advice.	15.220713920866013
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character." Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	11.108753154959038
What is your own opinion?" "That it ought not to be attempted.	15.011130907464718
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	14.563825419780017
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	12.697199136095762
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	11.484091500612694
I am not equal to it.	10.430467755690561
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	6.63976839524391
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.	8.652865301768502
We must not make him desperate." The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	10.429284506762482
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	13.880489671001273
She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	16.23686224445598
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	7.0253025633019925
"And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	8.187788445200395
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	18.354691366867403
Jane was not happy.	17.11093532770825
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.	7.558853103033515
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	12.983890950975288
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.	4.239672247531775
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	4.7630276561180995
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	9.3839401948375
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know." "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more." "Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	13.24160717644039
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	11.932972278493263
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done." But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	12.338593584368434
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	13.852131168552754
Well, well, I only hope it will last.	10.913461712005804
And what sort of table do they keep?	7.5725169088514335
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.	9.571718921314597
If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough.	9.802794463508777
Yes, yes.	11.465483515865207
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	8.291677106368022
_They_ will never be distressed for money.	8.164443918035111
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	9.108282722446578
They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." "It was a subject which they could not mention before me." "No. It would have been strange if they had.	10.719939854985103
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	14.991478873932346
The second began.	6.024657235210736
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	19.053925933578594
The dejection was almost universal.	7.474630493755546
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	10.416464358926799
"Good Heaven! What is to become of us! What are we to do!" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe.	11.841886736802726
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?" Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	8.143247267237566
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.	5.611033525758845
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.	10.073177414854959
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	12.322430985254398
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	20.584304013609458
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.	7.196077471267585
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	18.18817206416142
This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.	11.957650403422864
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.	9.082995638381968
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.	6.021620151435722
Forster, the delight of Mrs.	5.807871814449315
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.	18.872267285476074
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	11.728530266577874
"I cannot see why Mrs.	7.967289896544631
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.	7.763039983833797
I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older." In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.	20.672448910679208
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	9.618131843278114
He heard her attentively, and then said, "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances." "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair." "Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet.	10.630372965544788
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	13.804064206931562
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	9.756221493815955
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	17.24933829991623
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.	9.155858288542142
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.	13.199576865468483
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	11.16969002764651
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	13.37867055445508
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	8.105698350377066
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	7.941544223606963
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	6.664382154708133
Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrouled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?" Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply, "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love.	13.22940508046139
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.	8.65573613854743
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.	11.69873560891554
Let her go then.	7.811287030117552
The officers will find women better worth their notice.	5.6426550503547155
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	12.333513499936345
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life." With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	10.486002720486361
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	8.866974825968985
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	13.06619193397368
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	9.339988091646816
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	8.442965213304822
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	8.984776105623245
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	9.903569356717542
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.	16.44133082077811
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	13.388619713909932
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.	8.443192640716651
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	17.31283520829076
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	4.377523280048432
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	9.894236090601588
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.	9.626391840513246
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	10.945116721661426
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	14.660453021073488
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	7.449658374028846
"And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?	14.598227002020113
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	8.504287117639974
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials." "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.	10.645389454806246
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was." While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	11.141848709109352
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	19.254670149286337
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	11.851607687529725
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.	11.792720870672166
The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.	9.654717175665759
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	7.249135839761668
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	10.329803769048185
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	7.365679019543325
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	10.473573606727456
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	12.027849640668151
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	9.450030874051327
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	9.303622303880353
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.	16.167173147225583
But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	10.088401915585134
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	17.745151248599715
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	14.797666256555196
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	8.44373774365966
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	11.459177430889602
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	13.283452554277956
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	10.257882794143045
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	10.555195565599387
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	11.933062848371284
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	21.84753308518014
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.	10.202411650410097
Forster called her, and they were going to the camp;--and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.	13.7825559403875
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.	9.029695915714461
Everything wore a happier aspect.	5.502224050465728
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	11.386805163131422
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.	10.76285724145184
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.	8.100898082000636
Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	12.396729535161457
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.	12.341759407938529
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	11.793449000437727
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.	11.251931650732317
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	10.483494898881286
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	15.437184119608435
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	9.688120058069503
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.	11.96348148317841
"But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me." The period of expectation was now doubled.	8.246837369901847
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	12.612373874201925
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.	12.487242870484264
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	11.73683729304166
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.	9.71241791720142
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	7.2457133671481735
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.	6.247431821933056
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	14.332466352343799
To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs.	7.718048900559956
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	11.606830364919102
It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it.	5.465415741241193
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	6.066792708686451
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	5.822413678103144
Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	13.734895355841308
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt.	17.944734206414523
"A place too, with which so many of your acquaintance are connected.	14.12526845137086
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know." Elizabeth was distressed.	9.121254619022215
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	6.726927043711927
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	8.07519527555624
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	7.2570688174813425
They have some of the finest woods in the country." Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.	17.522060156850085
The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	31.41269532884113
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	17.771020055418834
A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme.	13.732061980689044
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	9.649123183271936

[Illustration: DOVE-DALE] PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	3.700630558236499
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	11.86807693049976
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.	13.342119525147574
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood, stretching over a wide extent.	8.507866166175805
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	9.689701259377657
They gradually ascended for half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.	9.818364610139774
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	7.853826221798782
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	6.176456129759003
Elizabeth was delighted.	11.52417183139379
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	11.616091262252455
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	11.044591398966501
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	9.870577801521621
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	15.256812592953363
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	12.02995469135263
They followed her into the dining-parlour.	5.950161604566533
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	9.644446133647051
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.	17.72506792347146
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	7.896696317536682
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	17.759204385543306
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	6.386373659337724
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them." This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	12.033783503597594
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	9.844316722842123
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	11.691113066692003
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	7.938213316933133
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild." Mrs.	10.32324885648409
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.	11.409161997918078
It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago." "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.	12.093404834826131
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	14.52283203317569
Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.	13.38744867229444
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?" Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little." "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?" "Yes, very handsome." "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	9.691980212650884
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	11.20315254824121
He was very fond of them." This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.	11.414611836537981
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	10.260498668441816
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.	13.97441684640759
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.	6.671007926378905
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him." Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	10.020914106340383
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	9.04507622565115
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?" "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months." "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate." "If your master would marry, you might see more of him." "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	10.638574731708085
I do not know who is good enough for him." Mr. and Mrs.	11.584801577668442
Gardiner smiled.	8.33478381713704
Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so." "I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him," replied the other.	13.28122163510794
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old." This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	11.38969768707187
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	14.352970713979156
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	12.074566555993359
You are lucky in having such a master." "Yes, Sir, I know I am.	13.798171552424625
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.	27.797277470053743
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	9.541885622159546
Gardiner.	10.970721034688431
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	7.985547801877557
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	17.432707973538697
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	10.774498191605039
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.	14.02177897118048
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.	8.653659557660953
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	15.641135597141666
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.	2.052876875918894
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men." "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.	9.260520265306992
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend." "Perhaps we might be deceived." "That is not very likely; our authority was too good." On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.	11.52448329837963
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	11.663839435703613
"And this is always the way with him," she added.--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment.	9.786010940289982
There is nothing he would not do for her." The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.	13.341922959040236
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	15.00293446237665
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	14.108319340505652
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	9.887607095289967
At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	15.837101571397469
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	14.975984751659464
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	12.481684084549935
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	14.035835085967628
As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow!--How much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.	13.286346573996717
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	9.706844309977663
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	8.402239111285812
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	10.018967513719751
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	13.911220609108891
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	11.918930336720802
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	16.79562171641861
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family.	8.489787219099512
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	14.070975907577596
Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.	14.164582930922178
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	10.888617526422243
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	12.540949773232622
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	7.1557247626381635
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.	8.1046290250733
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	10.168271556816874
That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to enquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.	12.442075346278658
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	8.978293886061984
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	10.305203363937952
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was.	9.854917122890866
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of every thing, she was still dear to him.	17.873467976896546
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.	16.924537247965848
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	13.964836168950265
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	12.492217235287695
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	11.923557472853737
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.	7.935838852491383
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	10.179519514760203
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.	12.533114277878862
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	11.361683915889152
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	13.607123621233267
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	12.021606010864186
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	7.02956713227952
With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed.	12.567563953890433
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	9.516612870311157
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	14.42347492187601
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	11.532734230720436
That he was _surprised_ by the connexion was evident; he sustained it however with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner.	11.702204988146311
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	15.230444367362681
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	11.3623047835292
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	14.757003106685529
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.	10.160112862262306
It is impossible that he should still love me." After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	11.534196742554768
It originated in Mrs.	2.8701157803785162
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	10.383654807396207
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	10.96011141972144
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	11.797764645124934
"They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters." Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow.	8.402618456361969
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.	9.385510707521542
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	8.064017376747778
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	20.722801782082087
They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.	6.9604876000050275
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	12.311966161606628
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	20.067788825626497
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	9.016273044376257
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	7.4228000461431405
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.	10.375717561502476
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	11.883070406155388
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	12.20958259631359
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	10.412844648955055
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	12.149166051382812
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it." "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	6.178130295416144
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	15.877358752578354
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling." "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	14.632743358694864
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.	19.568961726126705
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds." Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	10.655912672765878
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.	8.921856052127907
Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	13.680995203934645
He has not an ill-natured look.	12.880946186249794
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	8.663050093536466
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	14.258018263969857
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	12.272349190059638
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue." Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	13.637372695201009
In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.	11.560774619421595
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	12.548694670915166
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	16.096022834119147
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	18.233679187284775
CHAPTER II.	6.822487150374098
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	8.593777075356284
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	16.031248252309446
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	7.222850013126875
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	11.690497941200016
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	9.33646049222319
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	14.918508237620243
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	9.942588981543977
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	14.48352152644365
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	12.76804968290638
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	12.661883138090895
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	10.306927473749314
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	13.108077919979186
To Mr. and Mrs.	2.8961465528501433
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	7.795375284312337
They had long wished to see him.	9.20437432850268
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	9.685863775592463
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	10.613616863896993
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	7.918062194137614
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	19.854308514874624
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	21.274726980549094
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	16.29225578852582
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh! how ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a like manner.	11.341758869581133
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	13.671471219995972
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	13.804527831976936
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard.	4.550973099446997
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	8.297682862693655
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	11.807250046866061
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.	14.206373637275734
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield." Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	10.364015121311237
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	19.221517271069516
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day.	13.413141042369064
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	11.67794792038486
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs.	7.936999371592779
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed.	10.254722284113285
Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head.	11.367783270910612
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	12.810609617213627
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	10.918517716679949
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	11.589135083154295
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	11.79647488993094
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs.	4.962152759557193
Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication.	9.05327269687852
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her.	15.475284616117522
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	11.501543677350929
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	12.531830269197561
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	13.693449645207565
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	13.206580768338345
She certainly did not hate him.	6.6779234223740795
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called.	11.608125687721465
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.	9.01706686917928
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	10.933508765764373
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	9.241065714693121
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	13.278232827788472
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	16.668414494708713
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.	14.759379374429766
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	17.718906935354223
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	15.437293526761657
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	9.842443799642416
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side, the acquaintance would now be renewed.	10.702199548039555
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	6.084305484829105
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	8.321115348821875
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs.	8.885790020409798
Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London.	10.056273647186488
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	13.02426954904226
By Mrs.	2.8849486137780103
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	10.201765595152654
It was first broken by Mrs.	4.369956536167671
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.	10.454731474084738
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	12.764924810792383
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	14.625956958045117
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	11.55584059587866
Her own thoughts were employing her.	4.423791330945006
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	6.857566555521868
She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine.	14.10587134876518
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family.	8.501433681036495
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	7.540721522841104
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	17.82758753122468
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	12.293368819185469
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	13.766351005104136
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	10.143725584438137
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	13.2179624439304
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	14.827861739396619
They must be a great loss to _your_ family." In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	12.680009033668373
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	7.3679708389427
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.	28.74689860090886
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	11.12176899017971
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	11.092517864687942
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	9.50105795142762
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	14.193297307342355
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	10.28992517904863
But Georgiana would not join her.	4.689179043564637
When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.	10.028899106958553
"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.	15.952355258772291
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again." However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	8.896086390216462
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.	11.335455462106173
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	6.701470829097928
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.	9.106329725172463
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	10.269059427188225
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	8.763137572351996
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.	14.982305756689541
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	11.725716216989472
CHAPTER IV.	8.01744683224889
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	13.39599710790273
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	12.559072799244731
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	10.491528737289428
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	6.779304782184737
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	8.571185292001525
It was to this effect: "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.	7.63430604803072
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	11.77718803159851
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	13.678838951428904
So imprudent a match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	11.454772087852831
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	7.97940798368846
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	13.837212318541177
Our poor mother is sadly grieved.	6.308010685194561
My father bears it better.	6.762931137486875
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	9.0212270740453
The express was sent off directly.	4.2980918511845285
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	12.107743813086833
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	7.2269699342422165
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	11.119705791431837
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	20.09211335504556
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written." Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	11.113600631887893
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.	12.822139536204112
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	14.343999084536854
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	12.669624263521433
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	6.352787246672861
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.	5.862939364588496
who instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.	5.947735029859579
intending to trace their route.	11.987208401512637
He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.	5.828426258700938
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.	8.84765254706237
I know not what to think.	6.735645097466677
After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	8.61796687828496
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	10.36891078589381
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	9.912305247440543
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs.	7.400831432374885
but no one can throw any blame on them.	4.289025013683145
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	13.526451679820969
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.	7.114920549410807
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.	10.471089835159258
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	9.999557309799288
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.	10.034695164221494
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.	4.61171001007428
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	7.202606601733704
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	12.523610994899501
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	19.19146908091903
Adieu.	18.7596690870173
I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	10.619654570021833
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	15.886756643819412
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	10.50181624647256
What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.	12.064114202113952
In such an exigence my uncle's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness." "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared.	12.258384656685301
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	9.049334057706712
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose." "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs.	11.001658917285047
Gardiner.	10.970721034688431
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself." Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	11.040318753815189
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	8.973433172672031
On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid.	9.8601191649772
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill." "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	8.657301301663473
"There is nothing the matter with me.	7.075243110469133
I am quite well.	9.797103407733994
At length, she spoke again.	10.25198441234669
It cannot be concealed from any one.	8.292714404763768
They are gone off together from Brighton.	7.853433065217394
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	9.587202516899701
"When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.	11.615530964308894
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened.	8.325275711648981
But is it certain, absolutely certain?" "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland." "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?" "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	9.064884079918004
How is such a man to be worked on?	14.969075489503437
How are they even to be discovered?	19.71402103745553
I have not the smallest hope.	11.008730170877001
It is every way horrible!" Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	8.925150952725323
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.	13.115178277685517
Wretched, wretched, mistake!" Darcy made no answer.	3.9071398270929247
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	10.262034246192002
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	10.673069560525715
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	9.566346858151524
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	9.24375171935483
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	8.136921832600011
Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	13.148229030737722
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day." "Oh, yes.	16.034325027446762
Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy.	7.480224438512904
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately.	3.554567104252832
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.	8.493522900408415
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	9.339821440642664
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	9.76555397537677
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	10.41049935317029
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	14.582197356851614
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	16.34448430886155
But now it was all too natural.	10.565786667509117
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	7.8847211392590815
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.	9.979370704324111
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	6.366174336236882
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.	15.341086350948567
Mr. and Mrs.	3.3307406594046864
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs.	10.699023396028329
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	7.158500231240866
Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.	9.782314523451094
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.	5.885259226975793
Gardiner.	10.970721034688431
"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?" "Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.	9.548567608177349
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!" But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	11.6128171596222
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.	13.651830750468298
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	12.733088535106175
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	13.405900887777221
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	14.246214695747932
His temptation is not adequate to the risk." "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	8.37710227466895
"Upon my word," said Mrs.	3.6462632703662257
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	18.25077610757131
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.	5.636815715097653
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.	10.49665537236229
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	8.044694567270328
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	12.716264073134875
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.	10.199231735906363
Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?" "In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland." "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road." "Well, then--supposing them to be in London.	10.307911026601325
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland." "But why all this secrecy?	9.816511100094266
Why any fear of detection?	7.411432028013413
Why must their marriage be private?	7.685628617084254
Oh! no, no, this is not likely.	18.589615334764076
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	10.945318333103282
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	10.309083415762869
He cannot afford it.	3.57693663243954
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	9.103868239768305
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	10.544897978771749
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	14.639890451760536
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter." "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	14.530067797271299
But, really, I know not what to say.	12.249865395533197
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	8.084564407429667
But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year, nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.	14.468260390302076
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	10.437266716154149
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	10.111101428846078
But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is.	9.646259569327118
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	14.47190463585899
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	11.841056489296701
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	15.43182061864891
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	11.981220830239623
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	13.077240258314506
From what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl.	12.571517263966115
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	15.599405143972612
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her." "But does Lydia know nothing of this?	10.6353550506937
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?" "Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all.	11.639751304030652
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.	15.845857330941742
And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	14.1191239157814
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	11.435354462837491
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	5.628601159474143
That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head.	10.429075798027693
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts." "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other." "Not the slightest.	9.703290469733938
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	10.265429156611786
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	28.71014646280626
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites." * * * * * It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.	17.05904670440558
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	7.434502479206209
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	6.339853581228037
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.	13.087493422287276
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	9.68126659638447
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.	8.453523035391393
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	12.591344883677637
"Not yet," replied Jane.	9.832555456173646
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	11.36568106294282
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention." "And my mother--How is she?	11.849465549058435
How are you all?" "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	11.765040775196182
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	18.145819957267488
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.	8.495850852598782
Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven! are quite well." "But you--How are you?" cried Elizabeth.	6.665903407640718
How much you must have gone through!" Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	13.478754051395375
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	14.882556997454905
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	10.97865896553133
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.	9.441524484778828
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	10.245154936771595
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	14.133276643432076
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.	14.038996955980084
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do." They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	11.26698795960129
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	16.556509625328253
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	12.324976716599725
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done." "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs.	12.066434690481646
Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for.	12.536358610018572
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.	9.423020205150367
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	11.110988973250532
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	11.978191478639847
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	11.992687896053887
Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all." But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	15.99472030346992
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	11.39186893168643
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	9.600893474537656
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	22.372721732517412
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation." Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex." Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	9.931374807070794
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	9.211942854789259
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	15.55098849306778
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.	14.611482409368419
Give me farther particulars.	9.380863261955174
They must have seen them together for ever." "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	10.894974739417064
I am so grieved for him.	6.164717120045234
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	13.411009825120617
Did he know of their intending to go off?	13.401766509906416
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?" "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	7.8026932038691115
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before." "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?" "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	13.091235873187292
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	9.078455367575447
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks." "But not before they went to Brighton?" "No, I believe not." "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	11.79473964822435
Does he know his real character?" "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.	9.881066038368624
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	10.245336691770573
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false." "Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!" "Perhaps it would have been better;" replied her sister.	10.116672300995624
"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.	14.15402500944155
These were the contents: "MY DEAR HARRIET, "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	13.424912001789542
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.	14.708958637187374
I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.	15.219328556916663
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia Wickham.	12.268993305611513
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	10.821455848500857
Good bye.	8.01744683224889
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to our good journey.	8.906598411845344
"Your affectionate friend, "LYDIA BENNET." "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.	7.0231578131564945
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	18.31496625578691
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	13.885810841685915
My poor father! how he must have felt it!" "I never saw any one so shocked.	11.34045887188091
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	15.955392302240483
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	12.874802451989977
You do not look well.	8.217205043864933
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.	17.59219377067913
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us." "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	14.158296970014868
Assistance is impossible; condolence, insufferable.	7.636883644492713
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied." She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	12.918189461868558
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	12.079855055612711
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	10.869511056049593
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.	9.776326340209213
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	11.289968605543095
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	11.558524011320422
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	14.009766428692437
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	13.737181039586899
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	3.502753308886098
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	22.045425224566333
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	8.407719167141705
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	10.874373003886648
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	14.586980839567156
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.	11.087561183317993
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	12.846777345865265
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	10.828819307637255
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	12.955286032133841
There was also a postscript to this effect.	6.774000534212892
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	18.149334071174938
At present we have nothing to guide us.	8.348437685701768
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	11.93186907309681
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person." Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	9.506496873415236
She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years.	16.43738702936081
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	12.780954704706263
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	15.4789827259056
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	14.625639504093275
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise.	13.32176458288116
It was as follows: "MY DEAR SIR, "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.	10.67990671405698
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.	13.047695342168723
No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	10.221348919872664
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	9.987045157160367
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	11.941475650545257
Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.	12.159133761230501
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	14.865741172543283
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	8.971421900484176
&c." Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	26.059511632477996
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	10.676330048390545
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	10.56671122838871
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	14.051902395003118
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	10.167313941892012
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	13.277188801271095
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.	10.93626767969647
"This is wholly unexpected.	9.560918927650661
I had not an idea of it." Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.	19.858465497441017
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	11.996922794590482
When Mrs.	2.8849486137780103
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	15.465716968128591
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia!" she cried.	10.204573688078323
"Sure he will not leave London before he has found them.	8.94877516813731
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" As Mrs.	10.836773784899826
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	9.999095576992113
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.	7.639150392166116
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.	9.037023085566714
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	12.953990291861471
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	12.269747007046108
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	7.597071771951911
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that.	12.466779651555553
Who should suffer but myself?	7.621993272371649
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it." "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.	11.791391509914614
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	12.0345060347111
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	14.29078056059121
It will pass away soon enough." "Do you suppose them to be in London?" "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	10.314304566292913
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration." Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind." They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	11.418736291020789
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	10.027423297971975
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner." Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	14.227209234214234
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	8.682270069326565
If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them." CHAPTER VII.	14.369864052244639
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask." "What do you mean, Hill?	10.712996896148892
We have heard nothing from town." "Dear madam," cried Mrs.	6.806268007204388
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	13.420929717121712
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter." Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	13.976132969709763
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse." Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	11.241604540758424
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "Oh, Papa, what news?	10.737923772268928
what news?	8.666182915967102
have you heard from my uncle?" "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express." "Well, and what news does it bring?	11.753877281774718
good or bad?" "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it." Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	11.743608657141996
Jane now came up.	6.684437300161336
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about." "Gracechurch-street, Monday, August 2.	7.346370175951273
"MY DEAR BROTHER, "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	14.524211517524817
Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were.	13.1947519775522
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	12.599443117596563
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both----" "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!" Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.	15.621932942049972
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	15.540805323400088
All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.	11.323294543713871
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	12.045333472145163
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	9.149757667313423
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	11.475454670403321
Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	9.2798130608243
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.	16.375643388255686
She comes to us to-day.	8.377653923388548
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.	10.619538896469392
Your's, &c.	4.772756957305952
"EDW.	10.969192385311041
GARDINER." "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	9.918017501127887
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?" "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.	16.00830086703524
"My dear father, I congratulate you." "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.	8.931672215311531
"No; but it must be done soon." Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	16.013089470946085
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with." "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little." "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!" "Yes, yes, they must marry.	10.194804449139488
There is nothing else to be done.	13.427662556795012
But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him." "Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?" "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone." "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.	13.590422806276088
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.	10.65599552727607
A small sum could not do all this." "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	10.63469137229514
I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship." "Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?" Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house.	12.65403938838037
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	9.2288887439685
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	10.160255810444704
That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!" "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her.	10.183368646760274
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	10.332856354623045
He has children of his own, and may have more.	14.949788655386756
His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking.	13.240980610376363
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten." "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.	9.616030072751306
It is useless to talk of it." It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	10.486559404779289
They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to make it known to her.	11.312946933307469
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "Just as you please." "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "Take whatever you like, and get away." Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	12.590317718109041
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	4.159248899615274
Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all.	8.287454439465384
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	16.602633428372435
Bennet could hardly contain herself.	7.5844915603196945
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	12.10911632256649
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	7.783681811132889
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.	13.803401962978006
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	12.543761341956587
How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.	12.5695080470751
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	13.94100437722423
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.	9.166209760308265
I will put on my things in a moment.	10.421832469089862
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!" Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	10.901465452162677
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure, to his kindness.	11.958627157086216
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money." "Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?	9.47996287473375
Well! I am so happy.	7.585806519741712
Wickham! How well it sounds.	8.925916272180384
And she was only sixteen last June.	11.581798033352726
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	16.543022290412498
Other schemes too came into her head.	6.482291617040384
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	15.23375044524749
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.	12.145255490134213
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	8.373911743912899
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?	23.71629231190388
Oh! here comes Hill.	9.798071126351545
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?	16.603188139508795
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding." Mrs.	10.274618083122471
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	6.66637796884
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	12.680550403485789
CHAPTER VIII.	7.331239552044485
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	12.886209680910984
He now wished it more than ever.	8.218637348852367
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	9.899319036290233
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	13.854768067722718
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	12.63381232340374
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	7.745035918142147
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	9.235585966828424
Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.	7.497844764063682
Bennet and the children.	29.228486074049403
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	13.783912681577617
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	13.51092043833784
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.	8.473154163558531
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	13.465670010683352
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	10.249944312329376
His letter was soon dispatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution.	8.933432345282691
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia, to send any message to her.	14.669474893938593
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	9.155025501956379
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	11.83085852006602
But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before, from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband, her misery was considered certain.	15.958005214978922
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	17.813429214323744
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	8.711100441864051
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	13.96508517588538
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	9.22152974487296
"Haye-Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings would quit it, or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful." Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained.	8.918471606616462
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.	12.359187380524059
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	15.69524102991424
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn." A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.	10.317809213314968
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	9.90378496108257
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever, on the occasion.	8.332848490128203
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.	5.286311578103377
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	7.995175791422748
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	11.567353429995292
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	12.88082541139557
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much.	17.254766844263287
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	8.828597540060795
Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other objection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.	10.997658649150315
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	14.85986108894305
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	10.48517668719755
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	34.00857207962925
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	11.322323913521599
She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence.	17.10706784331033
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they should meet.	16.762097346788607
But while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.	11.678635261295804
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	8.408225128101552
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	12.996227727409613
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	16.53121957813664
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	4.124132261396065
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	16.77183866026683
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	10.347131878893364
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	7.304074435967311
To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	12.524102956163109
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	11.987205833479182
And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	9.741236936527471
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	10.617927834699126
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North.	14.487312155364467
He promises fairly, and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent.	9.269285578075005
I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself.	11.00869247847386
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	6.874931155444729
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	12.387738665394844
Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week.	13.577712503877473
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.	13.310030878458544
GARDINER." Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	20.421400758199738
But Mrs.	2.507592810299147
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	13.532728149348214
"She is so fond of Mrs.	8.571299620142431
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	8.479768203605015
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	15.10110901690769
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.	13.60314581262927
CHAPTER IX.	7.331239552044485
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	27.914000615869597
The carriage was sent to meet them at ----, and they were to return in it, by dinner-time.	15.172082022109572
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets; and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.	13.455383509692293
They came.	8.33478381713704
The family were assembled in the breakfast room, to receive them.	12.034670731518778
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.	2.764239662935747
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	10.95677519943071
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	10.684406233096471
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.	9.885794201024927
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	6.171260373133096
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.	15.40501915837252
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	6.5538798407216765
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	10.148708436376786
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	14.677480619460232
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	10.845570905915302
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	8.782239669404577
There was no want of discourse.	12.248926810709838
The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her replies.	13.060346388252704
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world.	10.857761807937491
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	12.178859857049165
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time.	12.530050078321231
Jane was distressed.	12.403661160097638
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?	12.621625128062066
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing." Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	11.412932412607846
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.	13.429428561652578
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman." It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first.	12.326982794334976
Her ease and good spirits increased.	9.430519883699489
She longed to see Mrs.	6.260512550401183
Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.	11.178898004413185
Hill and the two housemaids.	15.343324014176261
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?	13.519347999092941
Is not he a charming man?	10.156039265961555
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.	6.675692080844167
I only hope they may have half my good luck.	9.29414815596957
They must all go to Brighton.	8.501974945885854
That is the place to get husbands.	25.32677608204277
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go." "Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	15.783967505054589
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.	14.11991745632822
I shall like it of all things.	21.101554601280387
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	13.220568679738133
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all." "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.	10.081871472617355
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over." "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands." Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	10.141701510970433
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	11.233602928109343
No one but Mrs.	3.7335803274396437
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.	14.766889830711087
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	9.279287284677192
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	10.156599367914954
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	9.715954878181643
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.	9.200863353217464
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth, "Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.	12.175083835542244
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject." "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	10.152453703116379
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	13.665737747211343
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.	16.404728290164304
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	14.539852449348246
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	15.924549456761692
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	9.947126350934385
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.	9.743992740371132
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	11.209806225428308
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	16.68986578652541
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.	4.860667408273765
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	13.013622865127214
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." "Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	20.671908937046116
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	9.066838790161738
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	7.306845600965077
You may depend upon my seeking no further." "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions." "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry." On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	8.95607573002139
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	10.06071196069755
Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding.	57.02263612287534
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	5.617737534662581
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	9.50892203364641
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	11.447353470755193
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance." "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out." Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	10.775294711218168
CHAPTER X.	7.331239552044485
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	12.088181567609906
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	13.365562317586607
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.	5.856081345176258
6.	7.7836355827887225
"MY DEAR NIECE, "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	8.563048157495823
I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	9.790878342917322
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	11.883033486811946
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	14.09375832751924
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	13.353457799946732
Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	14.150505878327738
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.	13.820787232142365
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	15.855715443978774
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	9.749954639282445
His character was to speak for itself.	17.836711605044297
He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	14.480030454479673
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.	6.569315323215321
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	12.293331031586353
She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	7.25777897740508
This Mrs.	2.8849486137780103
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	16.484295851850234
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	9.79092441856243
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	10.594821328210948
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	7.795525420337156
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	13.900370787716819
She cared for none of her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of leaving Wickham.	11.014106826832606
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	15.10761742358507
Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	14.432353194057693
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	10.971076601334374
He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	11.830960155234497
He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	17.426778788770246
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	10.429924833677655
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.	13.226723499761057
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	13.097221176436554
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	13.603065702390106
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.	15.461340234104043
But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.	11.329537839852867
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	15.627443528903088
He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	14.48688922004748
On Saturday he came again.	6.206713688008176
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	13.773497499431882
They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.	13.271255687833651
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	11.994238650761023
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	11.506193638226144
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	12.049255400681986
They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	10.007115295346871
But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	9.66233376315148
You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people.	13.464593559219502
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.	13.628155691573546
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	14.645465352039553
Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.	11.107024833325603
But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.	8.04266263444593
When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.	16.30240799946579
I believe I have now told you every thing.	9.876144575166718
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	13.224196448330293
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	14.737220138545062
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	14.215481825675097
I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	11.044514933112296
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.	11.164271569306187
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	9.680278374833396
His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	10.572373456658234
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	9.707055479548583
But slyness seems the fashion.	4.983494528588811
Pray forgive me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far, as to exclude me from P.	12.165061093908792
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	14.121027214717659
But I must write no more.	13.009583712856129
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	12.66693991126098
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	11.844084365378727
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	7.544623669993925
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	10.784298096382518
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	7.95627823894044
He had to be sure done much.	12.523565939828346
She was ashamed to think how much.	12.928853205563
But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief.	10.644798570779832
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	12.220637619335777
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	14.74785244819829
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.	10.529362647914029
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	6.877205778244589
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	10.703374250503975
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	12.182664312359211
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.	9.375565708672204
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.	21.184267490391168
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.	6.559131772616219
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome." "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	10.833339707422539
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better." "True.	10.831322733922098
Are the others coming out?" "I do not know.	5.697081398297056
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	22.520608668813416
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?	16.430227905255016
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.	38.798566147705785
But of course she did not mention my name to you." "Yes, she did." "And what did she say?" "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.	11.042005654696453
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented." "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	7.6612039377110595
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	15.133449825865394
We passed each other several times.	8.998721039514757
I wonder what he can be doing there." "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.	9.40311001935329
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	18.16796396740713
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had." "Yes; he introduced us to his sister." "And do you like her?" "Very much." "I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two.	11.119030376406286
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	56.90491038450463
I am very glad you liked her.	8.123892190628819
I hope she will turn out well." "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age." "Did you go by the village of Kympton?" "I do not recollect that we did." "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	11.31383759122287
A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect." "How should you have liked making sermons?" "Exceedingly well.	7.86002758311602
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	14.782477731125862
One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.	12.8417647705628
Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the first, you may remember." "I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly." "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.	12.122632147368082
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it." They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	13.53963116556117
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind." She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	10.931304300988522
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "Oh, lord! I don't know.	7.858873875955929
But you know married women have never much time for writing.	9.683965025368916
My sisters may write to _me_.	6.5715093333064925
They will have nothing else to do." Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	20.66624480881612
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.	10.604512400047707
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	13.785116503316218
Bennet very dull for several days.	5.6561168858497695
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.	9.57063670129168
One seems so forlorn without them." "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth.	6.7213340955121
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single." "It is no such thing.	9.125884677768642
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	15.090748786957496
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon." But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	13.280660880772968
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	11.936187318313548
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	12.679284511594359
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.	12.783545868699655
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.	6.636721006525873
Not that I care about it, though.	20.434376227649725
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.	10.355089581158929
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	9.55682451177378
And who knows what _may_ happen?	4.904546695791419
But that is nothing to us.	11.602917813864158
And so, is it quite certain he is coming?" "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs.	12.244554987855075
Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.	7.29647120478631
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	8.362987081543867
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.	15.769814867565055
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	8.85139890293749
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.	19.912953107771155
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	10.366502764769248
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	12.338093182823089
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself." In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	14.33413934085842
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.	8.8660467078056
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course." "No, no.	11.280491045557076
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	12.149537146311763
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again." His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.	12.926713434945674
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.	5.224614979597684
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.	7.631764831169181
He knows where we live.	8.797410827294094
I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back again." "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.	7.919326020857613
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	10.354321923491483
That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him." Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_ did.	11.89425878271339
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	12.73326049835934
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.	10.559807798280712
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much." Mr. Bingley arrived.	23.460328877060185
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	8.167992271466392
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.	6.076513514962666
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	10.847386122679017
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	5.642827468657427
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	11.981189363465608
That tall, proud man." "Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow.	7.546808218044789
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him." Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	12.04017320946299
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	11.264031801485968
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	5.763360843238441
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	7.513951967851734
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.	9.647765725151448
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.	14.991319458052727
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	14.705179811404138
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken.	9.382968841835202
But she would not be secure.	14.303832671215721
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation." She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	9.394544575448197
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	10.49909204390044
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	12.283894805288885
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	8.700550539995156
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	11.634686942599895
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.	11.567438683744676
He was received by Mrs.	6.885415328887922
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	11.158493208134514
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	11.120518157251452
Darcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs.	9.56768147360776
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	11.92011389300698
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	15.766950116103649
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.	11.158796152376159
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	10.857847093503205
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	15.206140724924891
"Yet why did he come?" She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	12.220979999966572
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	15.151367895222904
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs.	6.7299282828577
He readily agreed to it.	4.208865573427703
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	17.451442983452772
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	6.139737879957282
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	7.346553225648913
And one of my own daughters.	15.104104714953356
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.	7.961739361894877
It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.	20.258585071345916
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	14.619832622672567
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.	9.616373723909115
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	4.885562503695626
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	11.389323585442998
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	9.610449358648292
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	13.02348274142134
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	12.377130404700164
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	13.80058096575519
A few weeks, he believed.	18.21452130814113
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet's manor.	9.348788316365875
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you." Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	14.821612619213372
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	11.157058231834394
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.	14.403324308045812
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	17.27001732742236
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	13.828547446739622
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	14.377450785900445
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	15.712560849502532
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	8.612182289635724
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.	10.887771771541638
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.	11.23169242706771
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement." Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	13.410648915192606
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	12.414224603211371
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	8.92855492688795
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	25.410019416118608
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	11.848749729550555
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	20.615363233803283
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	13.56010475188769
Teazing, teazing, man! I will think no more about him." Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.	12.37480397361331
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	6.882986180380516
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.	18.722621939433537
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	10.78741355226413
"Oh, Jane, take care." "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now." "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever." * * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.	20.33241977549802
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	15.973452559333321
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two, who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time.	10.333045644795867
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	12.300311373484544
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	15.904848352669292
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	7.80328738867414
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.	15.468168498693844
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	11.72805474355457
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	13.413630768697027
He was on one side of her mother.	15.092123008577287
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	11.750839994556951
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	11.133336093573366
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	15.219433948174087
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	18.366694737322142
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever." The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	11.377295874828961
And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper, "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined.	14.166586737797555
We want none of them; do we?" Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	12.220178915256806
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?	10.70580658572887
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	16.093555938636886
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "Is your sister at Pemberley still?" "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas." "And quite alone?	9.0786769997512
Have all her friends left her?" "Mrs.	8.466997354261121
Annesley is with her.	3.87371833455591
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks." She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.	11.756679301275083
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	19.707050801476207
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	9.971077994184949
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	7.28476221161073
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	9.938432878710158
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?	13.42221939265317
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.	7.245954495900974
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	10.964640604295333
The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	10.088685095495348
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.	11.632466138837042
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.	8.294604254454821
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	8.921691201171393
'Ah! Mrs.	3.764088157344288
I do think Mrs.	4.330566314356867
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously." Mrs.	9.094499516269634
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	16.638712201927788
"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth.	17.703858185483135
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	11.099962303730685
I hope we may often meet again." Elizabeth smiled.	13.837994362409905
"Lizzy, you must not do so.	10.744555794109353
You must not suspect me.	8.361532199571435
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	7.393722622770171
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.	9.95013906915174
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man." "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment." "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!" "And how impossible in others!" "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?" "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	11.6599306717429
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante." CHAPTER XIII.	8.437596343572045
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.	11.452752362951806
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	7.834956307185651
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	12.479454099269903
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky." He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	7.164272313050604
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	11.11576848454613
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	16.909688261951278
In ran Mrs.	2.7309583981100913
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	12.171925441621044
Make haste, make haste.	9.979055360146315
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	15.014186678635609
Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair." "We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago." "Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it?	10.591865675321387
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	9.11839562808025
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.	4.487527167320026
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	7.192209600719345
Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma?	12.486828125129488
What do you keep winking at me for?	9.433416401326657
What am I to do?" "Nothing child, nothing.	11.351467825136856
In a few minutes, Mrs.	3.523622656190104
Bennet half opened the door and called out, "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you." Elizabeth was forced to go.	8.975797994288785
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	13.4445963903142
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room." Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.	10.567326032474773
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	10.964785633522329
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	11.757636125915878
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	11.65508552018628
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	8.419551534006294
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	18.684092766921758
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.	9.587226466357228
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on.	13.913771384255877
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	8.752443004076795
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.	10.599328302399877
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	10.220512789724538
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	14.504626949930378
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	12.510296414092384
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her.	10.60412437014536
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	10.092600228648758
_Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she thought was still worse.	7.129480352068417
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	10.021456411401644
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.	12.870734150590161
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.	8.647245804230321
I do not deserve it.	5.956668568114823
Oh! why is not every body as happy?" Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	11.840453980730315
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	9.60957775561134
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	12.301004459296479
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	15.79996794179522
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	13.547516461032727
He is gone to my father already.	17.11501278538533
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!" She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	12.65687148227125
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	15.2188734422684
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	9.51419295617226
She will be down in a moment I dare say." He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.	14.879695849179178
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	12.382199959595841
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	9.364994742440565
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.	7.284369286326238
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.	11.196551896279198
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "Jane, I congratulate you.	13.012005929243477
You will be a very happy woman." Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	19.006558128689264
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	10.142345865255482
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	13.50862498109559
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	6.2630906623793745
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income." "I hope not so.	12.45709668035527
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be unpardonable in _me_." "Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of?	6.881860188376698
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	7.593233205854881
I always said it must be so, at last.	11.778274570114965
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.	11.500843918899072
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	20.316361042505015
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child.	12.357086761108233
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	13.553935447967305
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	12.012596834691324
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	10.721757919374687
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	13.262655652155782
In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.	17.915982429545494
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible." "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.	11.800960434270236
"But how did he account for it?" "It must have been his sister's doing.	29.550542035356564
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	15.309190106903824
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other." "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter.	12.821652808926746
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard." "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!" "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty." This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	12.361877953712504
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	12.219477720970886
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane.	7.818752603600533
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!" "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	9.929086412195302
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time." The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.	12.582451082457164
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	13.177353065778528
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	12.190196439696113
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	24.01634021139591
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.	10.995533988356069
As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery.	14.426956210033374
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.	9.793925483857826
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	12.636817211718624
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	12.000266440040049
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	13.347806963319062
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	10.48832375312018
That lady I suppose is your mother." Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	9.507767226350436
"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters." "Yes, madam," said Mrs.	6.347072417099773
Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.	22.441918416330676
"She is my youngest girl but one.	10.576543223399506
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family." "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.	12.317494536884649
Collins well." "Yes, very well.	5.897204075206844
I saw them the night before last." Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	15.34789030892644
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	10.475124830219302
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth, "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	13.165813451867894
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company." "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.	9.598529479958248
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	13.292752972688213
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	8.23578012408784
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.	11.109090407561764
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:-- "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	11.844933051678051
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	8.457827764708851
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	12.854836082867768
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	7.439115837674919
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	7.6654261529820875
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	16.884584120330633
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you." "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	9.29235523457459
What could your ladyship propose by it?" "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted." "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence." "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	7.6101308250920425
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	6.371605405580954
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	15.799233923718385
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible." "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.	10.23065920505408
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	8.231982345504099
You may have drawn him in." "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it." "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	18.992151011154515
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.	7.486568050075446
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns." "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit." "Let me be rightly understood.	9.309106233443917
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	11.39229796089652
No, never.	24.070160160335274
Now what have you to say?" "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me." Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	15.782973928601331
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.	17.369848081164434
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	12.806620128090003
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	8.977266912662843
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?	8.480933539370593
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?" "Yes, and I had heard it before.	11.697199706597756
But what is that to me?	13.856392967497836
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	9.501532418191438
Its completion depended on others.	5.0134761313343645
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	8.14451639332167
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?" "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	7.044316709866939
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	13.077756932028505
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us." "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.	7.192937116799535
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine." "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	14.061220177429337
Is nothing due to me on that score?	12.194985257760399
"Let us sit down.	10.41109616873102
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	7.592629431301237
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	12.214922335185578
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment." "_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_." "I will not be interrupted.	10.751387227228207
Hear me in silence.	9.849113603720795
Their fortune on both sides is splendid.	5.1799155925917235
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	12.571816827703591
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	10.642342593934016
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	16.49976358430865
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal." "True.	15.354356689601698
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	7.300892316919769
But who was your mother?	14.468304820792659
Who are your uncles and aunts?	4.904546695791419
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_." "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, "I am not." Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	13.269307072193648
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?" "I will make no promise of the kind." "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	13.941405182844246
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	17.374783808306105
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	18.902670716057134
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require." "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	9.739022782001557
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	11.202822619196285
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	12.944367946232703
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	9.343496781176297
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject." "Not so hasty, if you please.	9.481571627795542
I have by no means done.	11.363589111148624
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	11.019089204735092
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.	44.06886579646604
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	17.47160657864186
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	15.723440544249794
Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?	9.411784795099974
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?" "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	10.24008777607473
"You have insulted me, in every possible method.	15.220693348264144
I must beg to return to the house." And she rose as she spoke.	15.418242914961864
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.	16.76408724590208
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	11.951057360199952
You know my sentiments." "You are then resolved to have him?" "I have said no such thing.	11.306176641593508
I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me." "It is well.	14.896063981967355
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	9.229401521334452
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	8.979050303085044
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	14.576371221557034
And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn." "And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.	11.716962229132822
I shall now know how to act.	15.722022426281011
I came to try you.	8.638510952028279
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point." In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	13.787634048677571
I send no compliments to your mother.	7.3167022256556375
You deserve no such attention.	5.906717517442835
I am most seriously displeased." Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	9.04158059935192
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	7.108638369622443
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	12.132801586261408
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go." "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	11.745726822657662
She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you.	14.487720984503962
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?" Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	14.768305601327123
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.	9.493729733099519
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	12.720523329870948
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	7.177048528405241
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	7.779707387883087
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	14.914462813870081
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	12.398409629360133
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	8.943792174511326
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	15.231878968031339
In that case he would return no more.	6.355535282439832
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	13.297946713805445
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	13.25103912947385
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all." * * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	22.067172426219265
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	6.686278607799298
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	32.81725115032637
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	10.987351195669218
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	17.525582632410874
He then said, "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly.	8.325587203457575
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	12.139407411271916
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.	12.427622189379429
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest." The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "You look conscious.	14.119722375403105
This letter is from Mr. Collins." "From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?" "Something very much to the purpose of course.	13.762928341590799
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.	12.261552139463333
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.	9.112894694535116
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	10.690604212722507
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	2.8229019234131503
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	11.16196777542065
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land." "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	10.641160636133682
Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of." "Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is?	13.638699522001737
But now it comes out." "My motive for cautioning you, is as follows.	8.05525092156001
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye." "_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.	12.432098898779614
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!" Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	16.052016628713172
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	5.922456767398178
"Are you not diverted?" "Oh! yes.	6.421592971319087
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr. Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	14.176517779109668
I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married.	9.443957131685687
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing." "_That_ is his notion of christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch.	10.832072304768
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	9.746215688399646
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	14.586649299347096
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	9.27193954120907
But it is so strange!" "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	11.137359505174977
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.	9.41513476099828
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	10.894521773782165
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	12.811757602867852
Did she call to refuse her consent?" To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it.	14.677162274445694
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	12.633034936032413
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	12.837556307392495
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.	11.960693036650529
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	6.304424652588718
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.	12.241310623063695
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	8.15454465781774
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	7.426190991416734
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	15.346918291823455
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	11.631606105352331
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them, she went boldly on with him alone.	11.994315263407174
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister.	8.749139267049665
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	11.18619281820333
Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express." "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness.	11.384222211632833
I did not think Mrs.	5.0070325889307545
Gardiner was so little to be trusted." "You must not blame my aunt.	14.76038199339261
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_." Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	13.13484528174312
After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.	9.171210037463217
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	7.157949901403007
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever." Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	11.672132693349345
The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do.	10.900708842384677
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	12.145913625176659
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	11.484970799708233
But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.	13.496352940797141
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	11.614904891526969
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly." Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	12.120693234609623
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations." "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	13.785638805117134
For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	8.849455591974568
It was unpardonable.	18.970745426689028
I cannot think of it without abhorrence." "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth.	6.7044074876693704
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	10.395848704799729
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice." "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	13.783997583153743
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way." "I can easily believe it.	8.010752406916282
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.	6.332089609316169
These recollections will not do at all.	7.267235934347084
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it." Darcy mentioned his letter.	4.983543075562225
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?	9.114751579116891
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.	13.59591148679221
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	15.164711583898972
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	11.430622893551831
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.	5.560347549643773
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me." "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies." "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	9.857599550368324
The adieu is charity itself.	4.983494528588811
But think no more of the letter.	9.52179305788915
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	13.082184493559012
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure." "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	8.225625688342678
But with _me_, it is not so.	7.761319211557095
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	11.073270379450225
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	14.9997913124706
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.	9.765395394892249
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	10.79162205648903
By you, I was properly humbled.	12.742702257866666
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.	17.053094067823437
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased." "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?" "Indeed I had.	9.524510505060276
I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses." "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.	9.296972346270742
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due." "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	11.994626745973093
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you." He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	10.918480583451233
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	12.819943038538723
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	12.008840546136176
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	9.614683489293338
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.	9.156662358197112
"Not at all.	4.230960288560127
When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen." "That is to say, you had given your permission.	15.066409990952938
I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	12.957731029231116
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	12.586814272743633
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	13.104011786625257
His surprise was great.	4.50281924336078
He had never had the slightest suspicion.	30.32696189633631
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together." Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	12.341391198008074
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection." "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him." "It did.	9.45007076067511
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	12.719211890023223
He was angry.	14.93022424054374
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	23.494162196973647
He has heartily forgiven me now." Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.	9.76194607571449
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	11.00631298286574
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	12.53724684474897
In the hall they parted.	22.456238418101073
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	11.24942785036263
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	5.382532023768239
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	12.282040777872782
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	6.215914165050153
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	23.126596599060203
"You are joking, Lizzy.	11.246235037129015
I know it to be impossible." "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	8.580576451636801
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.	17.743248311311785
I speak nothing but the truth.	12.678239492700948
He still loves me, and we are engaged." Jane looked at her doubtingly.	11.76149828191454
I know how much you dislike him." "You know nothing of the matter.	11.965590193673616
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	10.777426051519928
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself." Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	11.680560321032843
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.	13.814638461217498
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?	12.157403815561286
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" "There can be no doubt of that.	16.65863367720005
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	12.87963137851062
But are you pleased, Jane?	17.80602028377445
Shall you like to have such a brother?" "Very, very much.	13.403554351707879
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.	4.955763838019442
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	4.927672083972636
And do you really love him quite well enough?	13.627871335036255
I am afraid you will be angry." "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	9.283712840686986
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	16.494816386315275
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	9.644759217420962
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	9.286574953492197
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.	10.067431290361446
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.	9.803304589056587
I always had a value for him.	7.6200275419318055
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you." Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	12.616380677740452
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	12.090354643078136
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	15.602924048874392
* * * * * "Good gracious!" cried Mrs.	127.253711692563
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?	8.97501528054279
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	10.445320070029757
What shall we do with him?	10.00743608664006
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way." Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	11.404127479338866
It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view." "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.	11.11154365381319
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.	11.674355075575248
Bennet followed her, saying, "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	10.967141007302267
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience." During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	12.491047330775976
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's.	6.937775931197636
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	13.768210981784291
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	14.179121802731443
* * * * * In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme.	39.66122227885581
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	16.116784510811204
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	12.460378175391686
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing?	7.153925495271262
Have not you always hated him?" How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	10.928145573588266
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him." "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	11.037918034578304
He is perfectly amiable.	12.620288565657432
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms." "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.	12.134612421066588
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	12.991657976815834
But let me advise you to think better of it.	2.0615144734947983
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	12.28186588978473
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	6.807554391891578
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	8.294688275859858
You know not what you are about." Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.	11.78388260728921
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.	8.112879106950409
If this be the case, he deserves you.	7.009096376218166
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy." To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	9.521224529332876
He heard her with astonishment.	11.60213727925495
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.	9.17176493557691
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	7.432994278485847
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	9.214040444463237
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter." He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure." Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	15.271043778455084
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.	12.419795057355849
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	7.846090496398234
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	10.976158769438603
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	12.559200751528962
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?	8.529777291717743
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	9.88382249406593
I am so pleased--so happy.	13.503986531971352
Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	8.907252576448897
I hope he will overlook it.	7.787814244535896
Dear, dear Lizzy.	8.790812095274598
I shall go distracted." This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	11.12637398381256
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	16.508449271283002
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.	7.2878334781133445
You must and shall be married by a special licence.	16.92724030486269
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow." This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	16.914982458585232
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	6.748219161021485
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	11.461981117045122
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	10.349065962656747
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	7.091167634273954
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's." CHAPTER XVIII.	14.362522904881736
Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her.	7.814511683594899
"How could you begin?" said she.	10.59507572974258
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	13.562518808447146
It is too long ago.	15.45571444087539
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun." "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	12.025948315171126
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?" "For the liveliness of your mind, I did." "You may as well call it impertinence at once.	9.611537060235838
It was very little less.	23.408600110472484
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	9.130054409746888
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	16.352636217079972
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	9.972065065575507
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	12.563753097070045
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love." "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?" "Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	11.162338030965971
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	8.979819915394257
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?" "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement." "But I was embarrassed." "And so was I." "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner." "A man who had felt less, might." "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	12.441632160985826
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	8.408486821560668
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	9.714602683267922
This will never do." "You need not distress yourself.	8.602017996285173
The moral will be perfectly fair.	10.654012417448907
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	12.142744208869964
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude.	10.893219188674056
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your's.	18.273404226825427
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	15.722774810226495
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?	17.287192388557546
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	8.296275944090247
or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.	13.410655074496926
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made." "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?" "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	11.436802457095695
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly." "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	14.183709645851156
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected." From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	9.484488435430203
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	16.76461474355635
You supposed more than really existed.	8.412829809225423
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	7.7628109935454805
You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	13.120671721892617
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	14.62171549755178
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	13.940739120063885
We will go round the Park every day.	6.700609215032358
I am the happiest creature in the world.	7.874100908363394
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice.	14.959228069549328
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	18.626242922427128
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	12.517450447283782
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	12.22127412121909
Your's, &c." Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	22.139452193123432
"DEAR SIR, "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	8.06124870561264
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	5.519484786944574
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.	15.08305443449785
He has more to give.	15.683057412283775
"Your's sincerely, &c." Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	11.437400457104568
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	14.047030392940872
Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.	11.579707382699162
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	7.420467044182031
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	8.050918966614134
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge.	11.176279847638806
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	14.890999315695778
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	8.007415592793164
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	7.679220962877919
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.	8.888993232588756
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	13.53882085607956
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant.	20.581291000858663
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.	8.900307682044472
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	9.057046134493532
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.	2.4471978882564525
Bingley and talked of Mrs.	9.169211044733823
Darcy may be guessed.	18.813533603661718
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	11.003164191151003
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	7.023877621488596
He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.	12.088664199923114
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	13.131292201907321
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	7.7421183715501085
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	10.610058200581173
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	13.713379617068755
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	8.01384369905794
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	11.392314835361509
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.	6.986278870160322
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	14.726792534923494
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	11.48358504221963
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.	10.652901831181419
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	15.815152773286156
The letter was to this effect: "MY DEAR LIZZY, "I wish you joy.	7.491016105385915
If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy.	15.014203847022575
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	11.483877783973716
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	12.624391344489203
"Yours, &c." As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	10.190100475614187
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	9.891612397542794
Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme.	13.272187487265604
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	12.337426226406112
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.	9.382765433244069
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	12.626081838324719
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	14.098600551119446
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.	10.957931216075108
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	17.905109796812507
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	14.684315886255938
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	9.107902469101452
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	7.1204892763250545
By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.	10.740131632927584
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	12.87467530707589
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	12.49826027870339
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	15.881347870549922
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	12.985663373120529
