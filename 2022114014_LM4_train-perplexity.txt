Title: Ulysses Author: James Joyce Release Date: December 27, 2001 [eBook #4300] [Most recently updated: December 27, 2019] Language: English Character set encoding: UTF-8 Produced by: Col Choat and David Widger *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES *** [Illustration] Ulysses by James Joyce Contents — I — [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] — II — [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] — III — [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] — I — [ 1 ] Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.	6.173763136715689
A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air.	8.640163431939737
He held the bowl aloft and intoned: —_Introibo ad altare Dei_.	9.668278306545771
Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely: —Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit! Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest.	13.913557548572578
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains.	9.878385032520786
Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.	11.323677340834996
Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.	10.750752973934674
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly.	15.382961754139455
—Back to barracks! he said sternly.	13.677654803889983
He added in a preacher’s tone: —For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and blood and ouns.	11.829967934803745
Slow music, please.	8.69109789785807
Shut your eyes, gents.	13.40875204467001
One moment.	7.0411249363666295
A little trouble about those white corpuscles.	11.331459373889949
Silence, all.	5.745451265051952
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points.	10.05984326813674
Chrysostomos.	32.172570290454246
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.	10.289582649947373
—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly.	13.179111301570018
That will do nicely.	13.31861775157894
Switch off the current, will you?	7.993734344295773
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.	10.393424846993357
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.	7.161250958357593
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.	6.862742189850061
—The mockery of it! he said gaily.	17.078543841221954
Your absurd name, an ancient Greek! He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughing to himself.	9.930072016359711
Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.	10.312540315203282
Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.	9.778549819949427
—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls.	15.148338897124466
But it has a Hellenic ring, hasn’t it?	8.357475969441774
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.	8.465542560682039
We must go to Athens.	17.360569477337084
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?	10.924204542185223
He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried: —Will he come?	13.087072556519756
The jejune jesuit! Ceasing, he began to shave with care.	9.336996961451465
—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.	14.026337667548084
—Yes, my love?	21.02878455360687
—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?	15.750573726309476
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.	11.949660066590146
—God, isn’t he dreadful?	14.415377303034193
he said frankly.	34.10226434485354
A ponderous Saxon.	10.029007476173597
He thinks you’re not a gentleman.	10.73189281112509
God, these bloody English! Bursting with money and indigestion.	10.077670672245528
Because he comes from Oxford.	16.500474074660357
You know, Dedalus, you have the real Oxford manner.	13.805916167584126
He can’t make you out.	10.070543760781726
O, my name for you is the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.	17.816260692705022
He shaved warily over his chin.	10.643889793573718
—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said.	8.456795854603845
Where is his guncase?	21.203508950831377
—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said.	5.859357630287127
Were you in a funk?	24.59076086866947
—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear.	9.809760149944527
Out here in the dark with a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther.	10.55684633721382
You saved men from drowning.	8.735648925468418
I’m not a hero, however.	11.812544292976042
If he stays on here I am off.	9.503129564000867
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade.	23.36990273703006
He hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.	9.413693260899024
—Scutter! he cried thickly.	12.231215773912831
He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket, said: —Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.	12.554149518756429
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief.	11.82973718765008
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.	11.888822185125882
Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said: —The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.	13.708766401175147
You can almost taste it, can’t you?	10.546326358121314
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.	11.49903911172876
—God! he said quietly.	14.69233300689106
Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother?	12.304822491245499
The snotgreen sea.	6.01668524543319
The scrotumtightening sea.	5.775309789998608
_Epi oinopa ponton_.	12.318195011510658
Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you.	15.134823500417612
_Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.	9.707794069455698
Come and look.	9.531914907752101
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet.	14.655012526528017
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.	11.567532288770538
—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.	5.997903483326249
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.	10.338971622247078
—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said.	6.892632943411042
That’s why she won’t let me have anything to do with you.	10.930938783433957
—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.	15.550270254503523
—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said.	10.298434633641596
I’m hyperborean as much as you.	9.063116655466429
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her.	10.419397119191917
And you refused.	15.787419753610662
There is something sinister in you....	4.057047564401393
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek.	7.177379204128327
A tolerant smile curled his lips.	5.17181259337643
—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself.	9.392114410147611
Kinch, the loveliest mummer of them all! He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.	14.014679862837832
Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.	12.431748659006054
Pain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart.	9.038876856662373
Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	10.35718483402654
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him.	9.533460797873266
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid.	8.109790440830439
A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.	8.921651477555745
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.	14.966692757054698
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags.	21.105986437003175
How are the secondhand breeks?	14.880259024655668
—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.	10.090191892707349
—The mockery of it, he said contentedly.	16.621537420232283
Secondleg they should be.	7.215947577140618
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off.	6.56182725846441
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	12.949548468520424
You’ll look spiffing in them.	8.335235117889326
I’m not joking, Kinch.	10.05311981549303
You look damn well when you’re dressed.	15.03861706293679
—Thanks, Stephen said.	4.54079568456556
I can’t wear them if they are grey.	15.666809455341541
—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.	15.813254734070831
Etiquette is etiquette.	10.245125659879218
He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.	11.77366270332314
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.	7.1017793929688695
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes.	10.969970898380065
—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says you have g.	15.554315896019869
p.	17.705247751504768
i.	32.172570290454246
He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.	11.165706941358797
General paralysis of the insane! He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea.	9.076346025983462
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth.	10.01457519171509
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.	9.354743228223526
—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by a crooked crack.	13.29216552989614
Hair on end.	7.2643311668317905
As he and others see me.	7.666341760324191
Who chose this face for me?	7.9273009311476965
It asks me too.	5.209088514123807
—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said.	10.991607985196534
It does her all right.	6.829632308859967
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.	7.010414032689486
Lead him not into temptation.	11.526509241577275
And her name is Ursula.	19.607147993364862
Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.	13.625629577773534
—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said.	7.56786399578125
If Wilde were only alive to see you! Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness: —It is a symbol of Irish art.	11.130151754685567
The cracked lookingglass of a servant.	11.041539557592843
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him round the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them.	11.813715698021218
—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it?	10.192906198045144
he said kindly.	23.805974004768796
God knows you have more spirit than any of them.	8.537668503057228
Parried again.	5.364875352896063
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his.	8.611429883727928
The cold steel pen.	13.232776179435904
—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea.	10.996481391456143
He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not a gentleman.	12.619465437233014
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other.	7.062386347148027
God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island.	15.791544904538126
Hellenise it.	3.903055991727408
Cranly’s arm.	14.097761501673679
His arm.	8.262366375861127
—And to think of your having to beg from these swine.	11.845696142579616
I’m the only one that knows what you are.	12.506376774057513
Why don’t you trust me more?	13.07646057552036
What have you up your nose against me?	10.590080687174888
Is it Haines?	24.21208679475912
If he makes any noise here I’ll bring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.	10.747901912725188
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms.	8.839274821590706
Palefaces: they hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another.	8.693699442590168
O, I shall expire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears.	11.24736909489756
A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade.	11.093660771502687
I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me! Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle.	12.577749698559638
A deaf gardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.	6.8026465925914055
To ourselves...	2.4951008647228776
new paganism...	2.3608030459348393
omphalos.	32.172570290454246
—Let him stay, Stephen said.	5.057005848982789
There’s nothing wrong with him except at night.	11.298613927268086
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently.	16.255406992669137
Cough it up.	5.093496639453925
I’m quite frank with you.	7.601638765949968
What have you against me now?	12.324765112902789
They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale.	12.214634394930497
Stephen freed his arm quietly.	9.383689111865634
—Do you wish me to tell you?	14.316975371196941
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—Yes, what is it?	9.184307366227818
Buck Mulligan answered.	11.309981438673294
He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke.	13.642222759375182
A light wind passed his brow, fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes.	6.088350126922067
Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said: —Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s death?	18.12943767264635
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said: —What?	13.287330196066325
Where?	14.052664453048125
I can’t remember anything.	13.32456790584569
I remember only ideas and sensations.	11.020392169658244
Why?	12.512270304170855
What happened in the name of God?	14.950948986437654
—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get more hot water.	12.12059028642567
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom.	14.408584209379741
She asked you who was in your room.	16.358702275975638
—Yes?	20.046607644329956
Buck Mulligan said.	4.11502558203882
What did I say?	16.30412008418556
I forget.	11.625935299839336
—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead._ A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’s cheek.	9.963538403440197
—Did I say that?	11.86324143568736
he asked.	5.571194519539272
Well?	18.814633242637697
What harm is that?	7.437501203237675
He shook his constraint from him nervously.	9.795626114827975
—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own?	15.428270052444928
You saw only your mother die.	9.121905554133146
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom.	13.120708368141868
It’s a beastly thing and nothing else.	10.984590478905979
It simply doesn’t matter.	10.900722984663336
You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you.	13.26097087878602
Why?	12.512270304170855
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way.	10.515971419832585
To me it’s all a mockery and beastly.	10.178266835806657
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning.	10.949209129687715
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt.	8.27289054264757
Humour her till it’s over.	8.40240291710064
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette’s.	7.525656353496083
Absurd! I suppose I did say it.	9.73777348317188
I didn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.	9.333753662865446
He had spoken himself into boldness.	12.367664466548963
Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly: —I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.	14.055125458645346
—Of what then?	13.660116787180733
Buck Mulligan asked.	9.055337341580438
—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.	9.16669844315505
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.	19.887845059568402
—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.	14.019177122624034
Stephen stood at his post, gazing over the calm sea towards the headland.	14.035645418706483
Sea and headland now grew dim.	8.155771467838486
Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.	11.16233422862095
A voice within the tower called loudly: —Are you up there, Mulligan?	14.742622054729267
—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.	10.792826992090827
He turned towards Stephen and said: —Look at the sea.	12.525222082281818
Chuck Loyola, Kinch, and come on down.	8.716237782396272
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.	7.785576598999252
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with the roof: —Don’t mope over it all day, he said.	12.72525553305042
I’m inconsequent.	23.31903927922339
Give up the moody brooding.	13.70901972889033
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead: And no more turn aside and brood Upon love’s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars.	10.500879227162558
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed.	13.74269718805002
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet.	7.160908597702475
White breast of the dim sea.	11.848798713724955
The twining stresses, two by two.	6.486017834746071
A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords.	5.191651483854875
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.	12.55960151618416
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deeper green.	6.617006815747197
It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters.	11.160729846482143
Fergus’ song: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.	12.206937870981262
Her door was open: she wanted to hear my music.	10.945623831430892
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside.	12.468740788597902
She was crying in her wretched bed.	12.488001831460467
For those words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.	13.644582223132945
Where now?	8.705951375757234
Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer.	6.469905679027972
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl.	13.18888808138664
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang: I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility.	9.460171700245297
Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.	8.222373048055493
And no more turn aside and brood.	9.717287835243782
Memories beset his brooding brain.	6.236036847035632
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament.	15.562370855103305
A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening.	9.80250232408583
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s shirts.	13.060022615194939
In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.	9.482008414073388
Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul.	10.347450563949588
The ghostcandle to light her agony.	7.6694954261761445
Ghostly light on the tortured face.	9.814785898017524
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees.	7.481590608261233
Her eyes on me to strike me down.	12.293670885643664
_Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat._ Ghoul! Chewer of corpses! No, mother! Let me be and let me live.	7.30796878989063
—Kinch ahoy! Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower.	9.673947111690069
It came nearer up the staircase, calling again.	7.45454186321977
Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.	13.866615407795194
—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey.	20.344053175897635
Breakfast is ready.	7.790341086578495
Haines is apologising for waking us last night.	5.2362543110731155
It’s all right.	7.745559458195826
—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.	11.992490825258566
—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said.	6.081329835471654
For my sake and for all our sakes.	15.099698464772734
His head disappeared and reappeared.	11.08192242085987
—I told him your symbol of Irish art.	13.052502679525524
He says it’s very clever.	11.962919486458793
Touch him for a quid, will you?	8.98743647562153
A guinea, I mean.	9.735218671691905
—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.	8.008773107444167
—The school kip?	25.32056988343191
Buck Mulligan said.	4.11502558203882
How much?	17.890456849905004
Four quid?	14.207365831239104
Lend us one.	6.685656878661224
—If you want it, Stephen said.	7.24268656043777
—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight.	7.566663536429712
We’ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids.	9.94778350395443
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	8.039726173836035
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tune with a Cockney accent: O, won’t we have a merry time, Drinking whisky, beer and wine! On coronation, Coronation day! O, won’t we have a merry time On coronation day! Warm sunshine merrying over the sea.	9.493346936025953
The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten, on the parapet.	8.161992253893198
Why should I bring it down?	12.323279220574184
Or leave it there all day, forgotten friendship?	14.367222656484527
He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.	11.132263405685881
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes.	9.867431474120258
I am another now and yet the same.	11.383096224835267
A servant too.	4.586920176420202
A server of a servant.	13.611999347400996
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow.	10.927506625141
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.	8.600016437808298
—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said.	6.168173660758824
Haines, open that door, will you?	7.91186766561177
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker.	13.081077989508097
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.	13.094367455770175
—Have you the key?	14.071795861234952
a voice asked.	7.582065859547325
—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said.	6.330480638176656
Janey Mack, I’m choked! He howled, without looking up from the fire: —Kinch! —It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.	13.090847865605204
The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered.	8.763660733015595
Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.	9.755790638182521
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait.	8.436109247763921
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him.	9.961790971496747
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.	11.362676832281895
—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when...	7.084894097332095
But, hush! Not a word more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.	10.375442128244542
Haines, come in.	7.397379718537674
The grub is ready.	6.749467059208617
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.	15.115199014062327
Where’s the sugar?	18.894819080333153
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker.	12.948097071813882
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.	20.070291046923508
—What sort of a kip is this?	18.0322081100736
he said.	3.3900725752648877
I told her to come after eight.	14.726578535068654
—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily.	14.439824822759764
There’s a lemon in the locker.	18.494217916278515
—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said.	7.060512652962205
I want Sandycove milk.	12.889827569799067
—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his chair.	14.522667860230298
Sit down.	6.26706705748047
Pour out the tea there.	8.166595797004673
The sugar is in the bag.	12.932461033878454
Here, I can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.	17.822857054092033
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates, saying: —_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._ Haines sat down to pour out the tea.	9.237349184196379
—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said.	7.382189226945982
But, I say, Mulligan, you do make strong tea, don’t you?	12.428104934745141
Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s wheedling voice: —When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said.	11.151552611630253
And when I makes water I makes water.	10.426311830744917
—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.	7.976565274551039
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling: —_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she.	11.57684163359761
_Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God send you don’t make them in the one pot._ He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on his knife.	8.926116537434867
—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines.	14.518139735019988
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.	10.436273627671277
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.	14.099986905013655
—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.	16.657523720663068
—Do you now?	11.518860709152314
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone.	16.99160176280443
Your reasons, pray?	12.957604447575635
—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion.	17.153167264882633
Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.	14.552340139222213
Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.	13.203886005874844
Do you think she was?	20.26996791601472
Quite charming! Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf: _—For old Mary Ann She doesn’t care a damn.	12.126094673780605
But, hising up her petticoats..._ He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.	9.036070743305526
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	7.5230165281757895
—The milk, sir! —Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said.	10.220891550666641
Kinch, get the jug.	18.641643434873465
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.	17.98866149085524
—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said.	7.53255987587835
Glory be to God.	7.112573816816043
—To whom?	18.97471167695028
Mulligan said, glancing at her.	9.053007442930097
Ah, to be sure! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.	14.611577812666456
—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of the collector of prepuces.	11.649666812621737
—How much, sir?	12.062431968640189
asked the old woman.	12.313897442139536
—A quart, Stephen said.	6.227765862560246
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk, not hers.	11.604867111459034
Old shrunken paps.	11.174647867337557
She poured again a measureful and a tilly.	12.669568723761206
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger.	11.184843315852214
She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.	7.420938317799518
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs.	14.18292834411225
They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle.	8.013690050246392
Silk of the kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times.	11.364983707349722
A wandering crone, lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning.	9.657048271302026
To serve or to upbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.	9.109070547869335
—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.	11.006203621369325
—Taste it, sir, she said.	5.897599275455206
He drank at her bidding.	17.370837876429952
—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts.	11.391090331679438
Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.	8.273280514301492
—Are you a medical student, sir?	10.034274755943592
the old woman asked.	10.925212885855288
—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.	8.857292546654177
—Look at that now, she said.	7.265464418099808
Stephen listened in scornful silence.	5.7869229952306425
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights.	12.103395427137833
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey.	15.947731652699497
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.	8.939273027947287
—Do you understand what he says?	21.574932581051478
Stephen asked her.	6.639697784763984
—Is it French you are talking, sir?	11.295417399949182
the old woman said to Haines.	14.22946919189602
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.	11.623528295352203
—Irish, Buck Mulligan said.	4.909142836631793
Is there Gaelic on you?	7.717332413966959
—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it.	12.21251568500563
Are you from the west, sir?	15.988413974644157
—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.	12.556053928966104
—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland.	11.494834691412423
—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the language myself.	10.129948857356466
I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.	12.777941135505408
—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan.	10.697107652071793
Wonderful entirely.	15.07044042909492
Fill us out some more tea, Kinch.	9.641980642763977
Would you like a cup, ma’am?	13.61531384642434
—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go.	12.397122652419823
We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?	12.981621792210833
Stephen filled again the three cups.	12.410508822597432
—Bill, sir?	7.351041821790252
she said, halting.	22.701235962873174
That’s a shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.	9.587258860237304
Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets.	10.488561483329482
—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.	9.934872221890867
Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk.	9.165866238645421
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers and cried: —A miracle! He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying: —Ask nothing more of me, sweet.	14.597915436281774
All I can give you I give.	15.985491339763174
Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.	8.671774218497754
—We’ll owe twopence, he said.	6.522012720631896
—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin.	10.453539527376572
Time enough.	9.495695440594261
Good morning, sir.	5.170989786034188
I’m stony.	23.754530031965217
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money.	8.360201988764981
Today the bards must drink and junket.	8.814354804530337
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty.	9.101432438391164
—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your national library today.	12.950129503873036
—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.	5.799265690829076
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly: —Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?	12.68478930995381
Then he said to Haines: —The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.	12.183974989762278
—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf.	13.127785176250354
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke: —I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.	13.111101467251036
Speaking to me.	4.4951574399550145
They wash and tub and scrub.	8.212875264303626
Agenbite of inwit.	9.508471597620137
Conscience.	32.172570290454246
Yet here’s a spot.	11.35701945676208
—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good.	11.503367148617532
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone: —Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.	14.841471466610697
—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen.	12.497498716206373
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.	12.096573128181303
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock, said: —I don’t know, I’m sure.	12.079114055120172
He strolled out to the doorway.	12.338718834840185
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour: —You put your hoof in it now.	10.359141643785126
What did you say that for?	16.935067453833586
Stephen said.	3.3990640623497015
The problem is to get money.	11.684929119434775
From whom?	13.283064669336406
From the milkwoman or from him.	6.758270676308704
It’s a toss up, I think.	10.645296872982076
—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.	12.548293738619908
—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.	10.21549688476733
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.	12.499870606380314
—From me, Kinch, he said.	6.636384849036527
In a suddenly changed tone he added: —To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right.	12.05462423983245
Damn all else they are good for.	10.17710305324936
Why don’t you play them as I do?	12.780491987034114
To hell with them all.	7.282975191955062
Let us get out of the kip.	18.65753518473011
He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying resignedly: —Mulligan is stripped of his garments.	12.663625801569523
He emptied his pockets on to the table.	7.613131337116619
—There’s your snotrag, he said.	6.303651528532654
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	10.809086202781263
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief.	12.906244654672353
God, we’ll simply have to dress the character.	12.598614971946434
I want puce gloves and green boots.	11.077288035142857
Contradiction.	32.172570290454246
Do I contradict myself?	12.015766136822673
Very well then, I contradict myself.	12.109687426853947
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands.	7.6049104564064125
—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.	7.8773091120695575
Stephen picked it up and put it on.	8.416797011041432
Haines called to them from the doorway: —Are you coming, you fellows?	20.23695792109843
—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door.	11.564616360116213
Come out, Kinch.	12.41279672789524
You have eaten all we left, I suppose.	9.822255107005
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow: —And going forth he met Butterly.	9.235361789537604
Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it.	10.801144432321738
He put the huge key in his inner pocket.	11.982653086021484
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked: —Did you bring the key?	17.69560351563296
—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.	10.769069148990273
He walked on.	5.968325595406214
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.	11.176756577343758
—Down, sir! How dare you, sir! Haines asked: —Do you pay rent for this tower?	13.364225211150602
—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.	3.96715835920303
—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.	9.282675773618996
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last: —Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say.	9.054417784198428
Martello you call it?	7.686163309293345
—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on the sea.	8.083966050910751
But ours is the _omphalos_.	13.672879437360116
—What is your idea of Hamlet?	17.224752654035715
Haines asked Stephen.	8.216673741483776
—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain.	11.1688032782671
Wait till I have a few pints in me first.	13.094605979305182
He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat: —You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?	11.529954870343255
—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.	11.877154316763487
—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably.	12.056730561444208
Is it some paradox?	17.997443963878396
—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said.	4.126106762638631
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.	15.618807880864566
It’s quite simple.	19.30521865389205
He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.	12.21704770570192
—What?	12.016783147492532
Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen.	11.75439218889792
He himself?	14.47062798106989
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear: —O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father! —We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines.	10.73257475127474
And it is rather long to tell.	14.59387084340778
Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.	11.32825917141496
—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.	5.5982926182357815
—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore.	12.561474715875322
_That beetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?	8.509588822429892
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.	11.638407024510181
—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.	9.95448046323968
Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.	7.690879845569434
The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.	14.730124247337965
—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.	16.61468624334878
The Father and the Son idea.	12.20428282731209
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.	14.205565091578016
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face.	10.012605432785612
He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety.	9.913931041247631
He moved a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice: _—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.	11.302474442961303
My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.	14.290584362890183
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.	8.754618707180853
So here’s to disciples and Calvary._ He held up a forefinger of warning.	10.040019349469182
_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again._ He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted: _—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.	11.214457746676452
What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet’s breezy...	10.612773190701411
Goodbye, now, goodbye!_ He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.	9.173332594856701
Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said: —We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose.	11.042352991734806
He’s rather blasphemous.	20.255797232927744
I’m not a believer myself, that is to say.	9.927734843601106
What did he call it?	11.159368929213205
Joseph the Joiner?	16.4844632925734
—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.	10.362650016794372
—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?	18.05289047986804
—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.	13.452325771720613
—You’re not a believer, are you?	9.26518095118207
Haines asked.	5.670210055907986
I mean, a believer in the narrow sense of the word.	16.01638851962371
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God.	8.747364926315926
—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.	9.476491639876201
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone.	9.400538616196334
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.	7.219749639035543
—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.	10.844935050356078
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to.	6.810836208659534
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.	9.868438967806823
—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again.	8.968665073209547
Either you believe or you don’t, isn’t it?	6.630324843021535
Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God.	11.465883650707179
You don’t stand for that, I suppose?	15.504866577819735
—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible example of free thought.	11.629558710000701
He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side.	13.493407097214597
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.	9.78348770934411
My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path.	10.099544406077156
They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.	11.283002902543872
He wants that key.	9.648759113812607
It is mine.	15.476283582558581
I paid the rent.	10.216932151879254
Now I eat his salt bread.	10.07637148922324
Give him the key too.	8.246064373443117
All.	25.535385961793953
He will ask for it.	5.88496847292526
That was in his eyes.	9.714407380310066
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind.	13.670791577304819
—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself.	14.27870766337645
You are your own master, it seems to me.	9.460337234021702
—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.	13.904361542732135
—Italian?	15.758647907172964
Haines said.	3.4625634008272983
A crazy queen, old and jealous.	9.74113994663659
Kneel down before me.	4.580660844761962
—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.	12.599889694884618
—Italian?	15.758647907172964
Haines said again.	8.905318161676215
What do you mean?	17.60719342547977
—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.	11.430337184283616
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.	8.733900834185057
—I can quite understand that, he said calmly.	17.687162956125654
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.	9.584718506121819
It seems history is to blame.	9.47100508396824
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of their brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, a chemistry of stars.	6.712934374016517
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs.	9.97759553717671
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son.	9.24098214739603
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger.	10.665600976785345
Idle mockery.	12.621260247635798
The void awaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields.	11.872859065160965
Hear, hear! Prolonged applause.	7.228363303751386
_Zut! Nom de Dieu!_ —Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one.	10.270054496870587
I don’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.	10.82858121581678
That’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.	8.5416081972429
—She’s making for Bullock harbour.	14.008442114593956
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.	14.187046213707976
—There’s five fathoms out there, he said.	6.3075213494845634
It’ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one.	12.3765712429062
It’s nine days today.	11.732158744011539
The man that was drowned.	16.36602040791876
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite.	10.232032711321887
Here I am.	9.414036746491485
They followed the winding path down to the creek.	14.380674386868066
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.	12.207412200233337
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.	11.100162246693182
—Is the brother with you, Malachi?	14.309920481134922
—Down in Westmeath.	11.539940660243456
With the Bannons.	15.953616188787576
—Still there?	11.951433387200051
I got a card from Bannon.	16.39758794954851
Says he found a sweet young thing down there.	6.971941391218575
Photo girl he calls her.	5.9572303158352256
—Snapshot, eh?	5.967768362540669
Brief exposure.	15.009292486789496
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots.	11.721351183914537
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face.	6.204805128085213
He scrambled up by the stones, water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.	10.150645281010757
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines and Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone.	11.902192959054377
—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of rock.	12.483286883127604
Chucked medicine and going in for the army.	12.558430528004864
—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.	8.831298425440357
—Going over next week to stew.	6.9641297201607735
You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?	13.22078781959095
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
—Spooning with him last night on the pier.	15.404530487164754
The father is rotto with money.	5.893857654963822
—Is she up the pole?	20.634724663195023
—Better ask Seymour that.	5.22616183759597
—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.	4.497800169408908
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely: —Redheaded women buck like goats.	13.650501722032926
He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.	10.63201270955287
—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried.	9.123162561730284
I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless Kinch and I, the supermen.	13.380988948719319
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.	12.39693501514584
—Are you going in here, Malachi?	14.068994135074366
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Make room in the bed.	9.642383858805676
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes.	12.188009188557025
Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.	13.367956479071031
—Are you not coming in?	14.625787045788668
Buck Mulligan asked.	9.055337341580438
—Later on, Haines said.	5.403659040274307
Not on my breakfast.	14.828811157840711
Stephen turned away.	8.216105462033312
—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.	6.432763866233084
—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.	9.021217567573043
Stephen handed him the key.	11.317695004700061
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.	11.319671630558725
—And twopence, he said, for a pint.	14.260322943078473
Throw it there.	5.218881064517983
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap.	13.175475242620282
Dressing, undressing.	11.769976746652041
Buck Mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly: —He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord.	15.621986874008572
Thus spake Zarathustra.	11.424225661212864
His plump body plunged.	8.947342941897352
—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish.	11.220156433865974
Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.	15.3386756009072
—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried.	11.339733404823585
Half twelve.	10.030937572935462
—Good, Stephen said.	4.54880974927075
Liliata rutilantium.	12.819548085083689
Turma circumdet.	12.378863073457003
Iubilantium te virginum.	9.074654932062453
The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly.	14.516909819609547
I will not sleep here tonight.	10.484523977811465
Home also I cannot go.	7.368550596877086
A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea.	8.68885855396579
It called again.	5.189236923447554
A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far out on the water, round.	11.62913795110915
Usurper.	32.172570290454246
[ 2 ] —You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?	9.341574864080245
—Tarentum, sir.	4.2050870715005475
—Very good.	10.517459861766893
Well?	18.814633242637697
—There was a battle, sir.	9.343394431968857
—Very good.	10.517459861766893
Where?	14.052664453048125
The boy’s blank face asked the blank window.	11.36542790302209
Fabled by the daughters of memory.	13.081907087491263
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it.	8.36705768896333
A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess.	9.9817850954373
I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry, and time one livid final flame.	7.737912832802941
—I forget the place, sir.	10.783462392497809
279 B.	7.1545806754948895
C.	8.56499542248637
—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book.	11.342002150676285
And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done for._ That phrase the world had remembered.	11.202203105528593
A dull ease of the mind.	8.985049530792187
From a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon his spear.	8.840687289674275
Any general to any officers.	11.365983525031055
They lend ear.	6.785668231492026
—You, Armstrong, Stephen said.	4.039426453696025
What was the end of Pyrrhus?	20.389155666472043
—End of Pyrrhus, sir?	7.343807183234614
—I know, sir.	9.742588761403631
Ask me, sir, Comyn said.	6.037529043926243
—Wait.	10.311580736549672
You, Armstrong.	15.023407419182897
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?	17.37676191387637
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel.	9.51491972428315
A sweetened boy’s breath.	10.077511848105905
Welloff people, proud that their eldest son was in the navy.	11.429252894608336
Vico Road, Dalkey.	8.678360821820306
—Pyrrhus, sir?	7.823540670344148
Pyrrhus, a pier.	22.573714065410055
All laughed.	8.668454926516358
Mirthless high malicious laughter.	6.383250516866833
Armstrong looked round at his classmates, silly glee in profile.	8.642577041220793
In a moment they will laugh more loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.	11.332797207050904
—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, what is a pier.	15.865578405877288
—A pier, sir, Armstrong said.	7.961518761730047
A thing out in the water.	10.407967616943516
A kind of a bridge.	11.774832892215377
Kingstown pier, sir.	4.7844405727214365
Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning.	10.023151379777515
Two in the back bench whispered.	13.280750538393471
They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.	9.195915052424246
All.	25.535385961793953
With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily.	6.676757332268162
Their likes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in the struggle.	9.984332207635642
—Kingstown pier, Stephen said.	4.087944561571672
Yes, a disappointed bridge.	15.68427610431111
The words troubled their gaze.	8.438757795355064
Comyn asked.	5.295771030513646
A bridge is across a river.	7.678445026719848
For Haines’s chapbook.	22.257618127766683
No-one here to hear.	10.007170011890178
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind.	9.195316635468643
What then?	11.266566783373044
A jester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise.	10.655816799875549
Why had they chosen all that part?	11.5740610267152
Not wholly for the smooth caress.	16.66120497439097
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.	12.169684428971957
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death.	8.09731767329812
They are not to be thought away.	11.344885132011258
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted.	15.026106284434787
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were?	12.46120475609298
Or was that only possible which came to pass?	16.745575839532048
Weave, weaver of the wind.	9.744888839359211
—Tell us a story, sir.	7.9512616822809195
—O, do, sir.	7.810043713718763
A ghoststory.	14.949365283168918
—Where do you begin in this?	14.451158752127714
Stephen asked, opening another book.	9.288851636241533
—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.	5.843905145872939
—Go on then, Talbot.	12.153711333067463
—And the story, sir?	11.852799551013295
—After, Stephen said.	3.700593760478801
Go on, Talbot.	14.094352936322771
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel.	9.108064343813318
He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text: _—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._ It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.	9.44470926594571
Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night.	9.94766290239097
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy.	6.850226648439045
Fed and feeding brains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds.	8.152911610833957
Thought is the thought of thought.	13.698851379640043
Tranquil brightness.	12.651986113682064
The soul is in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms.	15.092769814625267
Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of forms.	5.709902485029662
Talbot repeated: _—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, Through the dear might..._ —Turn over, Stephen said quietly.	7.986234227802487
I don’t see anything.	11.659385666147912
—What, sir?	10.435571586208113
Talbot asked simply, bending forward.	6.7015379186094854
He leaned back and went on again, having just remembered.	14.594679636836995
Of him that walked the waves.	8.38199801634438
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine.	9.460005298577105
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute.	11.544900304829488
To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s.	9.023594971333328
A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church’s looms.	14.56389486896691
Ay. Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.	13.019795490171488
My father gave me seeds to sow.	12.035948834866339
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel.	9.082864364489089
—Have I heard all?	12.491373955644567
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
Hockey at ten, sir.	4.986398112690282
—Half day, sir.	6.9331080048757086
Thursday.	20.267449269082853
—Who can answer a riddle?	13.750388565518442
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.	6.40392122614612
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily: —A riddle, sir?	8.144333344797557
Ask me, sir.	6.202547816232172
—O, ask me, sir.	8.71131460146358
—A hard one, sir.	10.064111753467937
—This is the riddle, Stephen said: The cock crew, The sky was blue: The bells in heaven Were striking eleven.	10.310436661573641
’Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven.	11.576866184634765
What is that?	9.35879664373421
—What, sir?	10.435571586208113
—Again, sir.	4.838077691013947
We didn’t hear.	8.809205045093915
Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated.	12.323270308847766
After a silence Cochrane said: —What is it, sir?	10.415282278342834
We give it up.	5.968399205770024
Stephen, his throat itching, answered: —The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.	14.56166248246697
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay.	9.829299372385535
A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called: —Hockey! They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them.	9.872523326897472
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues.	10.990547470153711
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.	9.006398602004909
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading.	7.5332147607836575
On his cheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.	8.13242545907282
He held out his copybook.	16.754154841170607
The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.	14.009057114197352
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot.	8.56213391953578
Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.	11.946082892575765
—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to you, sir.	12.593654691132233
Stephen touched the edges of the book.	9.561726391238233
Futility.	32.172570290454246
—Do you understand how to do them now?	14.075230340075317
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered.	5.006407034909415
—Can you do them yourself?	12.399172521323893
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
—No, sir.	6.595748510743427
Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed.	9.932658146987947
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed boneless snail.	13.061132273939323
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own.	8.201142755927341
The only true thing in life?	13.122899607557171
His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode.	8.465738333416585
She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes.	13.504311526242416
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been.	10.934021946017044
A poor soul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek of rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.	9.509774267648057
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem.	13.304221085807821
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather.	12.9157453811515
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses.	8.457581759841569
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.	17.145254513910846
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of their letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes.	8.843174021824622
Give hands, traverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors.	8.677216962252558
Gone too from the world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.	9.002699105264611
—Do you understand now?	11.97885155902011
Can you work the second for yourself?	13.135836584332004
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin.	10.001598732115365
_Amor matris:_ subjective and objective genitive.	11.235618758573686
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.	9.045974251873265
Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness.	10.994858719479964
My childhood bends beside me.	4.413056295461603
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly.	11.471465293159177
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes.	7.814537030488513
Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.	9.460597245419962
The sum was done.	6.973688026406897
—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.	11.67031927790954
Thanks, Sargent answered.	8.610423578454288
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench.	10.075693003123579
In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.	17.22805639416839
—Sargent! —Run on, Stephen said.	6.6192232537398485
Mr Deasy is calling you.	5.857586137640946
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife.	10.836900356208202
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet.	7.821706649617621
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him.	6.608522492606586
He turned his angry white moustache.	9.963164147869767
—What is it now?	14.160351657157863
he cried continually without listening.	9.167625021173514
—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.	7.080427254919111
—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore order here.	11.387772920622782
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice cried sternly: —What is the matter?	14.550956176885915
What is it now?	14.577507255990772
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.	8.519570418677453
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs.	11.963956302600549
As on the first day he bargained with me here.	10.412571863095474
As it was in the beginning, is now.	11.023646778026365
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be.	9.079064018120299
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.	8.355762965359446
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor.	15.377295706580817
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.	10.17920108138068
—First, our little financial settlement, he said.	4.817626656635614
It slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid them carefully on the table.	10.634308114582945
—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.	7.296223676737484
And now his strongroom for the gold.	10.828009050530389
Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saint James.	10.735495231621575
An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.	9.407593715824412
A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.	12.03410867943703
—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.	9.032851984439457
These are handy things to have.	6.1005143141701215
See.	18.814633242637697
This is for sovereigns.	13.070120966042534
This is for shillings.	10.73117739636074
Sixpences, halfcrowns.	11.769976746652041
And here crowns.	11.760494299890162
See.	18.814633242637697
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.	8.371978837229305
—Three twelve, he said.	4.596657706887886
I think you’ll find that’s right.	12.083930466570447
—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.	10.574061732828056
—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said.	7.64218708576583
You have earned it.	6.359953155051672
Symbols too of beauty and of power.	11.544250566886479
A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.	8.644280501670647
—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said.	7.744820247361684
You’ll pull it out somewhere and lose it.	10.167773041914513
You just buy one of these machines.	13.050054703801502
You’ll find them very handy.	15.539984734989474
Answer something.	7.819127799593088
—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.	5.6610564440044575
The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same.	10.23129003617147
Three nooses round me here.	5.232737496041366
Well?	18.814633242637697
I can break them in this instant if I will.	16.146415777465293
—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger.	11.590038420362003
You don’t know yet what money is.	7.23833415050347
Money is power.	9.037421864512268
I know, I know.	8.983891571604262
If youth but knew.	7.429955395557588
But what does Shakespeare say?	10.653424006862407
_Put but money in thy purse._ —Iago, Stephen murmured.	11.628459607128027
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.	17.133447993210726
He made money.	8.659859059030083
A poet, yes, but an Englishman too.	8.263558699216587
Do you know what is the pride of the English?	21.680789403491744
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?	15.579365866144043
The seas’ ruler.	9.756108833838363
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.	12.961242314083474
—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.	15.270736072873454
—Ba! Mr Deasy cried.	11.141304243259226
That’s not English.	16.011736044020527
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.	10.354984345493191
—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast.	14.822691018496966
_I paid my way._ Good man, good man.	9.044371192986993
_—I paid my way.	12.445654976748637
I never borrowed a shilling in my life._ Can you feel that?	12.388275138504984
_I owe nothing._ Can you?	6.7730356346760585
Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.	12.304749065028583
Curran, ten guineas.	10.415829686795442
McCann, one guinea.	16.067623533849968
Fred Ryan, two shillings.	8.479775933150085
Temple, two lunches.	18.74555735306012
Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board.	8.373717028409853
The lump I have is useless.	10.132552024650591
—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.	10.916777513588695
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.	12.096916989276584
But one day you must feel it.	7.841252605663287
We are a generous people but we must also be just.	9.406176370288469
—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.	14.848257590532441
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.	10.761398495828471
—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.	10.836665073553444
I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time.	9.832457676349494
I remember the famine in ’46.	6.8663987426159725
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue?	12.74925347912064
You fenians forget some things.	6.198115078204691
Glorious, pious and immortal memory.	6.7021914494308925
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes.	5.226322965062624
Hoarse, masked and armed, the planters’ covenant.	9.961587694025733
The black north and true blue bible.	9.581642156443182
Stephen sketched a brief gesture.	10.48932814095984
—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said.	10.035297352487984
On the spindle side.	11.302888337514888
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union.	15.296558082965392
We are all Irish, all kings’ sons.	12.119862868339077
—Alas, Stephen said.	3.4453420989746464
—_Per vias rectas_, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto.	9.56592269931645
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so.	10.777840260718554

A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots.	6.344304452153952
Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!...	5.954472546002862
Day!...	2.4344720040315546

Lal the ral the raddy.	9.010500030496756
—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said.	8.11300319058169
You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, with some of your literary friends.	13.220081511092813
I have a letter here for the press.	17.437424889325463
I have just to copy the end.	9.995048126097874
He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.	17.835251881908093
—Sit down.	5.663577620188617
Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, _the dictates of common sense._ Just a moment.	7.759372810455588
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.	11.262658680945231
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence.	9.018786839491042
Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign.	11.790266069740987
He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.	11.395359846970042
—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys.	10.253449439678672
_But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question..._ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen, over the motley slush.	8.669617802252523
Even money _Fair Rebel._ Ten to one the field.	6.262339898096683
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.	8.89874990711879
Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.	11.43551012136467
Again: a goal.	13.6389145599001
I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust of life.	11.70950883164967
You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?	13.270443330353311
Jousts.	32.172570290454246
Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.	6.126762966813408
Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.	11.023720523101254
—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.	14.719539668339275
He came to the table, pinning together his sheets.	10.530439824487551
Stephen stood up.	5.328913521518655
—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said.	11.140061385066492
It’s about the foot and mouth disease.	11.22074543565437
Just look through it.	4.195910403441764
There can be no two opinions on the matter.	11.117846615452814
May I trespass on your valuable space.	10.29935063354093

To come to the point at issue.	14.394732942055226
—I don’t mince words, do I?	15.818846023040326
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.	7.842910700614301
Foot and mouth disease.	9.206903194255172

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.	16.018731440919566
—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said.	12.062710796015756
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle.	11.504616319217824
And it can be cured.	16.745187634514494
It is cured.	21.6923361866218
My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there.	5.54694933304402
They offer to come over here.	6.609258167561704
I am trying to work up influence with the department.	17.282217975616735
I am surrounded by difficulties, by...	4.958734798640108
intrigues by...	2.572755041472129
backstairs influence by...	2.7495599072623884
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.	10.252504721813084
—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said.	5.601597281626786
England is in the hands of the jews.	15.506842399027732
In all the highest places: her finance, her press.	14.437716537114014
And they are the signs of a nation’s decay.	22.04448315581484
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength.	11.79861627744065
I have seen it coming these years.	10.06748325000062
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction.	11.301055366380426
Old England is dying.	9.282579573657042
He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam.	12.402804327299098
He faced about and back again.	6.849440780191586
—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.	9.322089931083543
The harlot’s cry from street to street Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.	10.763269999866221
—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or gentile, is he not?	10.049278926256662
—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely.	13.811389168147906
And you can see the darkness in their eyes.	13.133658227042991
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day.	14.680892495445796
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers.	8.356026457771128
Gabble of geese.	8.150313597010452
They swarmed loud, uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats.	8.166351053822615
Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures.	8.544056351775346
Their full slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain.	7.727085408487517
Vain patience to heap and hoard.	6.778192501374678
Time surely would scatter all.	4.883684931563049
A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on.	6.413333124570307
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.	9.225887390499306
—Who has not?	17.556005053772292
Stephen said.	3.3990640623497015
Mr Deasy asked.	7.633014101267768
He came forward a pace and stood by the table.	10.718942110220073
Is this old wisdom?	15.551062565722468
He waits to hear from me.	6.564713708930456
—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	12.871798601038755
From the playfield the boys raised a shout.	11.443879724242334
A whirring whistle: goal.	6.746844694569369
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?	13.085318578597272
—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said.	10.359328651687356
All human history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.	7.288627077526372
Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying: —That is God.	11.699491258959581
Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee! —What?	8.68951838442129
Mr Deasy asked.	7.633014101267768
—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.	11.677163874060644
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers.	11.508035245158304
Looking up again he set them free.	9.48200605199532
—I am happier than you are, he said.	8.30928323734954
We have committed many errors and many sins.	8.9064100551258
A woman brought sin into the world.	7.31805202696512
For a woman who was no better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks made war on Troy.	10.286486014203998
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	9.758406958863533
A woman too brought Parnell low.	8.823921170074424
Many errors, many failures but not the one sin.	8.918627926191586
I am a struggler now at the end of my days.	11.795418264712394
But I will fight for the right till the end.	18.77961158750164
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right.	7.461501328610675
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.	7.609622127658032
—Well, sir, he began.	13.620150252222153
—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at this work.	11.536095774128603
You were not born to be a teacher, I think.	11.409056794309306
Perhaps I am wrong.	20.096661374142222
—A learner rather, Stephen said.	5.897849035385311
And here what will you learn more?	14.109884533028211
Mr Deasy shook his head.	8.720744925347889
—Who knows?	20.826529569653808
he said.	3.3900725752648877
To learn one must be humble.	15.183403212770786
But life is the great teacher.	18.332646831712786
Stephen rustled the sheets again.	5.601552233703648
—As regards these, he began.	12.583872879357903
—Yes, Mr Deasy said.	5.769335377915222
You have two copies there.	6.852248463520206
If you can have them published at once.	10.62546443010277
_ Telegraph.	14.833002552262101
Irish Homestead._ —I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow.	14.36185511977953
I know two editors slightly.	10.799615664023833
—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly.	14.255567629139119
I wrote last night to Mr Field, M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the City Arms hotel.	12.080481109195684
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting.	12.714911582989169
You see if you can get it into your two papers.	15.275741993408763
What are they?	14.793850816429442
There is no time to lose.	17.268100157234088
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.	16.14504682660009
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.	9.884213247265027
—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.	12.980771949389295
I like to break a lance with you, old as I am.	11.07856759746311
—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.	11.148952210090327
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.	12.34886811501758
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors.	13.862471740203661
Still I will help him in his fight.	18.078007535541122
Mulligan will dub me a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.	11.847668380191886
—Mr Dedalus! Running after me.	7.099806130190996
No more letters, I hope.	15.34686618776674
—Just one moment.	8.828724185960672
Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.	8.17034666339791
—I just wanted to say, he said.	9.198824688228882
Ireland, they say, has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews.	10.537850871125187
Do you know that?	10.591596692236735
No. And do you know why?	19.07751011605941
He frowned sternly on the bright air.	10.277699842181955
—Why, sir?	11.417217772710936
Stephen asked, beginning to smile.	10.584720675087103
—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.	13.390687157720574
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm.	9.777444861645211
He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.	9.907181531734777
—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path.	13.3226936391125
That’s why.	15.653306828464878
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles, dancing coins.	8.625033662969988
[ 3 ] Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes.	10.606671878550992
Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn and seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot.	12.081509250315541
Snotgreen, bluesilver, rust: coloured signs.	6.253166191346917
Limits of the diaphane.	26.485027991414455
But he adds: in bodies.	13.897540464102766
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured.	20.32591608664075
How?	17.705247751504768
By knocking his sconce against them, sure.	7.495280937140373
Go easy.	11.48483282991716
Bald he was and a millionaire, _maestro di color che sanno_.	8.248071817840483
Limit of the diaphane in.	11.341528483188503
Why in?	14.430772702986483
Diaphane, adiaphane.	10.18424733735438
If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate, if not a door.	12.448429129465135
Shut your eyes and see.	8.039323517611303
You are walking through it howsomever.	13.107860284673311
I am, a stride at a time.	10.835805199129524
A very short space of time through very short times of space.	8.032029179939958
Five, six: the _nacheinander_.	16.629433183091553
Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible.	17.042616610272002
Open your eyes.	6.061531380802674
No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles o’er his base, fell through the _nebeneinander_ ineluctably! I am getting on nicely in the dark.	10.4356217110576
My ash sword hangs at my side.	7.022198906384292
Tap with it: they do.	10.125759910539196
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, _nebeneinander_.	16.599190792036765
Sounds solid: made by the mallet of _Los Demiurgos_.	9.62443003544732
Am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?	12.34140533335018
Crush, crack, crick, crick.	6.650961847801087
Wild sea money.	6.1214136265649275
Dominie Deasy kens them a’.	7.717230746293587
Won’t you come to Sandymount, Madeline the mare?	11.840351928382582
Rhythm begins, you see.	5.94184307580309
I hear.	7.666736785712443
A catalectic tetrameter of iambs marching.	6.154675166959953
No, agallop: _deline the mare_.	10.462950233066726
Open your eyes now.	6.697196598815301
One moment.	7.0411249363666295
Has all vanished since?	11.645005647453322
If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane.	14.267764670642931
_Basta!_ I will see if I can see.	14.14046396009326
See now.	4.99645159397126
There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world without end.	10.071272678692427
They came down the steps from Leahy’s terrace prudently, _Frauenzimmer_: and down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand.	10.124964329037498
Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.	12.281137161460675
Number one swung lourdily her midwife’s bag, the other’s gamp poked in the beach.	14.517319861195897
From the liberties, out for the day.	10.27055876873638
Mrs Florence MacCabe, relict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street.	9.077378297551281
One of her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life.	8.354136097681048
Creation from nothing.	6.903029100628584
What has she in the bag?	18.54796495334668
A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed in ruddy wool.	7.49580488892353
The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of all flesh.	10.330843073326614
That is why mystic monks.	12.417575058303294
Will you be as gods?	21.27694438942925
Gaze in your _omphalos_.	15.96718092168177
Hello.	16.81846716713923
Put me on to Edenville.	16.883766215649207
Aleph, alpha: nought, nought, one.	5.302309738715508
Spouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve.	5.775868320871669
She had no navel.	15.948567039133312
Gaze.	25.535385961793953
Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum, no, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to everlasting.	6.623352539136834
Wombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten.	11.342886233821613
By them, the man with my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.	13.748205884369627
They clasped and sundered, did the coupler’s will.	7.331475624657443
From before the ages He willed me and now may not will me away or ever.	9.594388287775434
A _lex eterna_ stays about Him.	6.941098976356319
Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial?	11.815641894263438
Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions?	14.133404902652117
Warring his life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality.	13.024966452434267
Illstarred heresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: _euthanasia_.	8.411360475879029
With beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of a widowed see, with upstiffed _omophorion_, with clotted hinderparts.	10.038326908836261
Airs romped round him, nipping and eager airs.	9.331514151887479
The whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of Mananaan.	7.658072606053046
I mustn’t forget his letter for the press.	13.417964020174413
And after?	20.413544493721446
The Ship, half twelve.	9.80753308948816
By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.	16.475498193202117
Yes, I must.	16.73689103712697
His pace slackened.	11.5000321055809
Here.	12.056869439375285
Am I going to aunt Sara’s or not?	13.387237314513252
My consubstantial father’s voice.	8.568514368413494
Did you see anything of your artist brother Stephen lately?	15.594981948275699
No?	20.267449269082853
Sure he’s not down in Strasburg terrace with his aunt Sally?	14.894015063859934
Couldn’t he fly a bit higher than that, eh?	10.53762144968078
And and and and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si?	12.24657530161241
O, weeping God, the things I married into! De boys up in de hayloft.	13.595757471920924
The drunken little costdrawer and his brother, the cornet player.	13.147015989501442
Highly respectable gondoliers! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir.	9.253961194847182
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
No, sir.	8.459302619677356
Jesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ! I pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait.	11.364749520124702
They take me for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.	11.05500941785423
—It’s Stephen, sir.	8.595921067895098
—Let him in.	6.8533468972299545
Let Stephen in.	5.288256537031857
A bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.	5.443155373440178
—We thought you were someone else.	11.988152201021268
In his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the hillock of his knees a sturdy forearm.	7.788764219603352
Cleanchested.	32.172570290454246
He has washed the upper moiety.	12.90619792353295
—Morrow, nephew.	8.423206090357604
He lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for the eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and common searches and a writ of _Duces Tecum_.	5.8303588137232625
A bogoak frame over his bald head: Wilde’s _Requiescat_.	13.21982655529619
The drone of his misleading whistle brings Walter back.	7.118176479651793
—Yes, sir?	9.954172657579104
—Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother.	8.430408157695227
Where is she?	15.23587065142297
—Bathing Crissie, sir.	4.395923116339564
Papa’s little bedpal.	17.600909717005237
Lump of love.	7.2119784745480775
—No, uncle Richie...	4.499175080593051
—Call me Richie.	10.174013747256103
Damn your lithia water.	6.479065119739668
It lowers.	14.509135749322695
Whusky! —Uncle Richie, really...	5.026952079130736
Walter squints vainly for a chair.	10.669331052832856
—He has nothing to sit down on, sir.	11.152261822432676
Bring in our chippendale chair.	9.089201010673412
Would you like a bite of something?	18.327265060916197
None of your damned lawdeedaw airs here.	7.131886594661115
The rich of a rasher fried with a herring?	18.405385075785627
Sure?	32.172570290454246
So much the better.	7.713004842166901
We have nothing in the house but backache pills.	13.554923554153774
_All’erta!_ He drones bars of Ferrando’s _aria di sortita_.	10.052933192151414
The grandest number, Stephen, in the whole opera.	11.369117027903723
His tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air, his fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.	11.042436849547961
This wind is sweeter.	9.883288723522448
Houses of decay, mine, his and all.	5.75855188461087
Come out of them, Stephen.	10.556239449710171
Beauty is not there.	7.374888361991503
Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh’s library where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas.	11.445618960425863
For whom?	13.283064669336406
The hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close.	11.187897394442041
A hater of his kind ran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon, his eyeballs stars.	11.49274676643142
Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled.	11.564146913770166
The oval equine faces, Temple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws.	7.111424253056315
Abbas father, furious dean, what offence laid fire to their brains?	11.8404162018603
Paff! _Descende, calve, ut ne nimium decalveris_.	5.603678913428227
A garland of grey hair on his comminated head see him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende!_), clutching a monstrance, basiliskeyed.	9.232513861771034
Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace and echo, assisting about the altar’s horns, the snorted Latin of jackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded, fat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.	8.410034130506618
And at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating it.	8.337831050832332
Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.	10.643758634420422
Dringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own cheek.	12.519791342768608
Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back.	8.031587275208189
Dan Occam thought of that, invincible doctor.	9.145148880663312
A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled his brain.	5.461185141048702
Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his second bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and, rising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang in diphthong.	11.096021512871063
Cousin Stephen, you will never be a saint.	17.0815455817711
Isle of saints.	15.438131805352084
You were awfully holy, weren’t you?	7.074590288430011
You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you might not have a red nose.	14.219947978657864
You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue that the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the wet street.	9.343250135904572
More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram alone crying to the rain: _Naked women! Naked women!_ What about that, eh?	11.269379732537894
What about what?	11.921694232655547
What else were they invented for?	11.459275196459503
Reading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh?	6.641819378390794
I was young.	17.954778497024847
You bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause earnestly, striking face.	7.804109329834033
Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one saw: tell no-one.	7.926152118651655
Books you were going to write with letters for titles.	11.71151079569252
Have you read his F?	20.553165684799854
O yes, but I prefer Q.	13.98161603313844
Yes, but W is wonderful.	17.18536815093656
O yes, W.	8.512860982679003
Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply deep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the world, including Alexandria?	10.776962196246963
Pico della Mirandola like.	5.940966130066613
Ay, very like a whale.	22.436424792283105
When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once...	7.836045231584691
The grainy sand had gone from under his feet.	8.892959355512005
His boots trod again a damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the unnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.	7.134938765172044
Unwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing upward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a midden of man’s ashes.	7.594122931238039
He coasted them, walking warily.	14.074853693368185
A porterbottle stood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough.	9.710115087368305
A sentinel: isle of dreadful thirst.	6.297637222083376
Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze of dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the higher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts.	8.922646603931948
Ringsend: wigwams of brown steersmen and master mariners.	8.108018594933446
Human shells.	9.940349403905003
He halted.	16.494956358829533
I have passed the way to aunt Sara’s.	9.648242986012788
Am I not going there?	15.42470184153915
Seems not.	7.4756841764583
No-one about.	9.017134746206178
He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand towards the Pigeonhouse.	10.33864881539635
_—Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?_ _—C’est le pigeon, Joseph._ Patrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.	8.395062263519241
Son of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris.	9.356501940214008
My father’s a bird, he lapped the sweet _lait chaud_ with pink young tongue, plump bunny’s face.	7.856187287961823

He laps.	14.509135749322695
God, we simply must dress the character.	9.797790891934659
I want puce gloves.	12.483097802364522

Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night.	4.950030081046975
In the darkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned platters.	10.36656871457666
Who to clear it?	7.157275630173831
He has the key.	12.62693910532097
I will not sleep there when this night comes.	10.171923916844742
A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer.	12.859380713696641
Call: no answer.	9.19695191540552
Take all, keep all.	8.572282485919636
My soul walks with me, form of forms.	9.690352440415367
So in the moon’s midwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing Elsinore’s tempting flood.	13.73182586165469
The flood is following me.	4.424096133567899
I can watch it flow past from here.	8.556159481278545
Get back then by the Poolbeg road to the strand there.	11.910895360310406
He climbed over the sedge and eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a grike.	9.89090235035817
A bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack.	10.68545745251148
Before him the gunwale of a boat, sunk in sand.	10.582175544179819
_Un coche ensablé_ Louis Veuillot called Gautier’s prose.	9.967030968348329
These heavy sands are language tide and wind have silted here.	4.514738803219719
And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of weasel rats.	10.687270832163048
Hide gold there.	4.883602351116002
Try it.	4.158488578013023
You have some.	16.99006097708669
Sands and stones.	8.319115173503487
Heavy of the past.	12.776391589548986
Sir Lout’s toys.	21.20258109989977
Mind you don’t get one bang on the ear.	11.205727705146435
I’m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders, bones for my steppingstones.	9.57727653763252
Feefawfum.	32.172570290454246
I zmellz de bloodz odz an Iridzman.	6.5818602341090875
A point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.	6.965876481274145
Lord, is he going to attack me?	16.495379205829142
Respect his liberty.	11.880926220330268
You will not be master of others or their slave.	13.70582352199999
I have my stick.	12.559135142900764
Sit tight.	13.326775215347485
From farther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures, two.	9.263674047074304
The two maries.	14.389236274328882
They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.	8.227397485743555
Peekaboo.	32.172570290454246
I see you.	6.3369736259091765
No, the dog.	18.6501019268391
He is running back to them.	9.333955773647448
Who?	12.76769298089698
Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf.	11.231357256400772
Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold.	5.545462230965055
A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows.	6.960628902716785
Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat.	7.28754454376092
Famine, plague and slaughters.	8.264777284193258
Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves.	10.695306644058787
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires.	11.11435988782503
I spoke to no-one: none to me.	8.21559454168856
The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back.	10.419196242880368
Dog of my enemy.	18.955430413866303
I just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about.	7.111475401599314
_Terribilia meditans_.	14.509135749322695
A primrose doublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear.	10.442211187944334
For that are you pining, the bark of their applause?	20.851349989277793
Pretenders: live their lives.	6.542797776152562
The Bruce’s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck, York’s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of a day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion crowned.	8.54331970083719
All kings’ sons.	7.205174783618143
Paradise of pretenders then and now.	5.049361283710228
He saved men from drowning and you shake at a cur’s yelping.	14.567616754978424
House of...	2.7021489610972105
We don’t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities.	14.68922280339905
Would you do what he did?	23.681317256166196
A boat would be near, a lifebuoy.	18.051859338438167
_Natürlich_, put there for you.	7.365852816514516
Would you or would you not?	11.364049019243424
The man that was drowned nine days ago off Maiden’s rock.	12.847597680540693
They are waiting for him now.	10.983530389107935
The truth, spit it out.	5.900379206321342
I would want to.	7.9060148448820655
I would try.	20.136908867200717
I am not a strong swimmer.	21.60410207689831
Water cold soft.	11.954914538804676
When I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes.	15.038487071013748
Can’t see! Who’s behind me?	12.568828789135127
Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured?	8.85196143307358
If I had land under my feet.	12.231439535946551
I want his life still to be his, mine to be mine.	11.597130452230065
A drowning man.	5.332784285369713
His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his death.	11.38381812067746
I...	2.8379138768886625
With him together down...	3.254209519631867
I could not save her.	10.415281431770955
Waters: bitter death: lost.	6.7068371566900264
A woman and a man.	8.63477949458041
I see her skirties.	19.097596022009956
Pinned up, I bet.	18.230411418984204
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on all sides.	7.330379301146077
The man’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears.	9.529124820220899
On a field tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired.	6.206606124257369
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears.	8.41973357677638
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse.	8.038902961507235
They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.	6.916629342529931
Cocklepickers.	32.172570290454246
They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out.	9.153930917995465
The dog yelped running to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning.	10.121746076534919
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws.	13.436130827036104
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop.	12.459459511921509
The carcass lay on his path.	12.11496277795303
He stopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell.	11.18503856646349
Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal.	8.753591431317242
Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies poor dogsbody’s body.	11.997233267374007
—Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel! The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight.	9.903261426028555
He slunk back in a curve.	15.376547764914418
Doesn’t see me.	7.837600436184845
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it.	7.352933362190075
He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.	7.613324504289059
The simple pleasures of the poor.	12.355984840921954
His hindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.	6.067813254784777
Something he buried there, his grandmother.	13.861991078721811
After he woke me last night same dream or was it?	7.302135058994628
Open hallway.	15.07044042909492
Street of harlots.	10.402399139993904
Remember.	25.535385961793953
Haroun al Raschid.	9.58813464919575
I am almosting it.	7.7708967052573685
That man led me, spoke.	12.052028591953297
I was not afraid.	29.04154814933714
The melon he had he held against my face.	9.147611186219557
Smiled: creamfruit smell.	7.475158422858929
That was the rule, said.	6.487036634440638
In. Come.	12.618204440453015
Red carpet spread.	12.089436373593871
You will see who.	12.704307662018609
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	11.555566299762784
His blued feet out of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling his unshaven neck.	8.273452896189458
With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strolling mort.	9.968939095027258
Spoils slung at her back.	7.388258488852034
Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.	6.091176695978755
About her windraw face hair trailed.	7.7331088567481014
Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville.	8.219796489191637
When night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway where dogs have mired.	8.854608651512018
Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.	7.784472298659397
Buss her, wap in rogues’ rum lingo, for, O, my dimber wapping dell! A shefiend’s whiteness under her rancid rags.	9.610043717017447
Fumbally’s lane that night: the tanyard smells.	14.963814026487862
White thy fambles, red thy gan And thy quarrons dainty is.	4.595099464455461
In the darkmans clip and kiss.	9.79469619431284
Morose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, _frate porcospino_.	7.1492498667058
Unfallen Adam rode and not rutted.	11.253210759051852
Call away let him: _thy quarrons dainty is_.	8.947544440548088
Language no whit worse than his.	6.637890876696344
Monkwords, marybeads jabber on their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.	6.51701634960435
Passing now.	4.779330306107821
A side eye at my Hamlet hat.	8.083891207103086
If I were suddenly naked here as I sit?	14.227045407814783
I am not.	10.66038032568982
Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands.	12.10941396595421
She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load.	4.658768336565295
A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake.	8.873205139194594
Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, _oinopa ponton_, a winedark sea.	7.77999563156714
Behold the handmaid of the moon.	9.029614545564986
In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise.	8.485747801830724
Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled.	8.655059264789267
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	7.384497882894177
He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	9.077089466571946
Here.	12.056869439375285
Put a pin in that chap, will you?	8.586828951973127
My tablets.	14.509135749322695
Mouth to her kiss.	15.382926128407895
No. Must be two of em.	17.22603471296749
Glue em well.	6.857488806548472
Mouth to her mouth’s kiss.	16.14672015909361
His lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.	9.26571413397469
Oomb, allwombing tomb.	8.316607427426987
His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched: ooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring wayawayawayawayaway.	5.296931857277892
Paper.	32.172570290454246
The banknotes, blast them.	4.948868420275367
Old Deasy’s letter.	11.902795802692363
Here.	12.056869439375285
Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.	7.7906402032861966
Turning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and scribbled words.	9.286701611851235
That’s twice I forgot to take slips from the library counter.	16.6965989276066
His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending.	13.490961311219829
Why not endless till the farthest star?	12.055830996787318
Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds.	9.65483642382647
Me sits there with his augur’s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.	9.656463806756687
I throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.	6.930849951101357
Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?	15.423545019269119
Who watches me here?	11.413344925049485
Who ever anywhere will read these written words?	8.425612813074194
Signs on a white field.	16.040305732772723
Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice.	9.377121165881302
The good bishop of Cloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with coloured emblems hatched on its field.	9.175623952809088
Coloured on a flat: yes, that’s right.	9.708849762246635
Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east, back.	7.083969212776246
Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope.	10.786760168853213
Click does the trick.	7.453399227629368
You find my words dark.	7.557747500195203
Darkness is in our souls do you not think?	17.82360353533951
Flutier.	32.172570290454246
Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the more.	8.92782156667156
She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes.	11.401718999272312
Now where the blue hell am I bringing her beyond the veil?	14.132628384104548
She, she, she.	7.831074558992462
What she?	9.982811431980723
The virgin at Hodges Figgis’ window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going to write.	9.258923054991865
Keen glance you gave her.	5.183292800147048
Wrist through the braided jesse of her sunshade.	16.61668806213525
She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady of letters.	10.524065437263776
Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup.	11.83906980194329
Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.	7.226872825693163
Talk about apple dumplings, _piuttosto_.	7.106380733695382
Where are your wits?	18.466765937836882
Touch me.	4.5216291380000495
Soft eyes.	5.455646160485135
Soft soft soft hand.	5.213629331820681
I am lonely here.	10.30143125365058
O, touch me soon, now.	8.845384439210399
What is that word known to all men?	19.61474814517918
I am quiet here alone.	11.62258669332102
Sad too.	4.66219583534958
Touch, touch me.	4.525112008492354
He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled note and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes.	8.921113269596376
That is Kevin Egan’s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep.	10.715793961944689
_Et vidit Deus.	10.723860184956957
Et erant valde bona_.	8.638467809111594
Alo! _Bonjour_.	11.56333526330851
Welcome as the flowers in May.	14.050438132518623
Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun.	4.980357932442483
I am caught in this burning scene.	16.697198747729097
Pan’s hour, the faunal noon.	18.24356371084894
Pain is far.	9.117248102459309
And no more turn aside and brood.	9.717287835243782
His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs, _nebeneinander_.	14.008528618132685
He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein another’s foot had nested warm.	6.381006899427529
The foot that beat the ground in tripudium, foot I dislove.	6.572029728700878
But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s shoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris.	10.48161267834715
_Tiens, quel petit pied!_ Staunch friend, a brother soul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its name.	8.31231927034988
His arm: Cranly’s arm.	9.509769965256508
He now will leave me.	4.490673710404292
And the blame?	30.888704282859504
As I am.	9.414036746491485
As I am.	9.414036746491485
All or not at all.	6.667839370994248
In long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering greengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing.	8.448116411184433
My ashplant will float away.	5.3215312411254025
I shall wait.	9.914592464903784
No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks, swirling, passing.	11.24551499814279
Better get this job over quick.	7.046975673782463
Listen: a fourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos.	6.178499243454288
Vehement breath of waters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks.	6.726728190104408
In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels.	4.638720013956846
And, spent, its speech ceases.	10.65409111959977
It flows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.	5.453867730380704
Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and sway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying and upturning coy silver fronds.	7.210036804158711
Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded and let fall.	8.159159975436493
Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh.	15.980908507444887
Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of their times, _diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit_.	7.017663189553258
To no end gathered; vainly then released, forthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon.	5.541185558003615
Weary too in sight of lovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a toil of waters.	9.630595248582992
Five fathoms out there.	4.871039405664287
At one, he said.	4.334187221120209
Found drowned.	10.537498549673511
High water at Dublin bar.	8.043376658067945
Driving before it a loose drift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells.	7.524845626942507
A corpse rising saltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.	7.701993585165279
There he is.	5.607266775302478
Hook it quick.	8.068752500126992
Pull.	32.172570290454246
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.	7.048416769174568
We have him.	6.118519365253732
Easy now.	4.779330306107821
Bag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine.	6.900208582937826
A quiver of minnows, fat of a spongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.	9.701148823612844
God becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed mountain.	5.753514383401957
Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a urinous offal from all dead.	4.8851322082690904
Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes upward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to the sun.	9.38743115804586
A seachange this, brown eyes saltblue.	10.242701050894034
Seadeath, mildest of all deaths known to man.	7.844443396189477
Old Father Ocean.	11.75919512244098
_Prix de Paris_: beware of imitations.	6.428816201026838
Just you give it a fair trial.	14.00042944603614
We enjoyed ourselves immensely.	9.856977255167958
I thirst.	11.308115195751736
Clouding over.	6.7082246848397125
No black clouds anywhere, are there?	7.807414079113491
Thunderstorm.	32.172570290454246
Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect, _Lucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum_.	6.307040326850005
No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy sandal shoon.	8.85004426997883
Where?	14.052664453048125
To evening lands.	10.263573611557954
Evening will find itself.	8.95572815633317
He took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying still.	10.207174698692445
Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me.	11.738484020815726
All days make their end.	6.106551369420626
By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest day.	10.821106274481762
Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum.	11.361713733519373
Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet.	7.768422684653046
_Già_.	25.535385961793953
For the old hag with the yellow teeth.	14.85622339626351
And Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist.	9.037161079740892
_Già_.	25.535385961793953
My teeth are very bad.	6.837423953024337
Why, I wonder.	19.644162663850103
That one is going too.	10.089436313727361
Shells.	32.172570290454246
Ought I go to a dentist, I wonder, with that money?	13.97250997465491
That one.	6.438066159695064
This.	22.307214335724723
Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?	13.927560741871382
My handkerchief.	10.053221221999014
He threw it.	4.486505767051648
I remember.	9.639089853962762
Did I not take it up?	14.157449452091
His hand groped vainly in his pockets.	12.343660843670927
No, I didn’t.	10.617571201731266
Better buy one.	5.851212584952071
He laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock, carefully.	10.66002124795239
For the rest let look who will.	10.527088761815273
Behind.	32.172570290454246
Perhaps there is someone.	13.101397833004121
He turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant.	13.425784268419337
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees, homing, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.	10.550063578861213
He liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart, liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes.	7.039530811648905
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine.	9.154854277876067
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray.	14.127526386089603
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere.	11.013376448638791
Made him feel a bit peckish.	17.12257475378548
The coals were reddening.	9.836897278849802
Another slice of bread and butter: three, four: right.	6.713857175719378
She didn’t like her plate full.	9.74065675863733
Right.	16.81846716713923
He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire.	11.600420304896003
It sat there, dull and squat, its spout stuck out.	6.760902810753206
Cup of tea soon.	15.302110749692423
Good.	20.267449269082853
Mouth dry.	10.048389012065714
—Mkgnao! —O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.	11.69834528490026
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table, mewing.	8.9272464784296
Just how she stalks over my writingtable.	8.137858226191499
Prr.	25.535385961793953
Scratch my head.	6.14258823121913
Prr.	25.535385961793953
Mr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form.	7.2116248596649255
Clean to see: the gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her tail, the green flashing eyes.	13.516330030918892
—Milk for the pussens, he said.	6.052476317762213
—Mrkgnao! the cat cried.	7.990315350185772
They call them stupid.	16.19482115173209
They understand what we say better than we understand them.	7.383461974344667
She understands all she wants to.	5.232626058832343
Vindictive too.	4.66219583534958
Cruel.	25.535385961793953
Her nature.	8.972574313932574
Curious mice never squeal.	9.827305886089453
Seem to like it.	4.419954591330961
Wonder what I look like to her.	10.783442588992859
Height of a tower?	22.254103947444122
No, she can jump me.	10.375074887657272
—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly.	16.02979947854962
Afraid of the chookchooks.	28.479171958839938
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.	17.433613715718874
—Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.	7.72608659237348
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively and long, showing him her milkwhite teeth.	8.414752809227505
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones.	8.82461504343463
Then he went to the dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him, poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.	12.612733190160952
—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.	8.039213215602514
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly.	8.806219241391332
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can’t mouse after.	13.659715950416143
Why?	12.512270304170855
They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips.	14.567098778866955
Or kind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.	10.189006498027643
He listened to her licking lap.	12.104702771721318
Ham and eggs, no.	7.517095772140893
No good eggs with this drouth.	9.106593468498133
Want pure fresh water.	6.21659492601624
Thursday: not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley’s.	9.147201733417624
Fried with butter, a shake of pepper.	12.576252985947773
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz’s.	5.235374364300205
While the kettle is boiling.	12.495096038747104
She lapped slower, then licking the saucer clean.	7.502514637813112
Why are their tongues so rough?	10.68352942438303
To lap better, all porous holes.	11.822173762268566
Nothing she can eat?	12.695984151195022
He glanced round him.	5.273575208823545
No. On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by the bedroom door.	11.832612111034962
She might like something tasty.	10.877977261099794
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning.	8.15077906719898
Still perhaps: once in a way.	7.931376230242824
Be back in a minute.	12.328850735272201
And when he had heard his voice say it he added: —You don’t want anything for breakfast?	16.682853451481286
A sleepy soft grunt answered: —Mn. No. She didn’t want anything.	9.057573428388672
He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer, as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.	12.33614169820885
Must get those settled really.	9.076074704637382
Pity.	22.307214335724723
All the way from Gibraltar.	16.24455055761355
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew.	6.743360522030807
Wonder what her father gave for it.	6.839040787752441
Old style.	10.58374593461624
Ah yes! of course.	7.510349198943753
Bought it at the governor’s auction.	19.768311492452227
Got a short knock.	13.672979675840425
Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy.	10.968079929606452
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
At Plevna that was.	5.384566488591412
I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.	8.20148670715116
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps.	14.212595062432893
Now that was farseeing.	24.917855521509733
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof.	12.649382478686608
Stamps: stickyback pictures.	7.8281081229673495
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too.	7.567925046243575
Course they do.	7.520400298604067
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s high grade ha.	12.671529460274614
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband.	6.77710162838585
White slip of paper.	6.107062685112118
Quite safe.	12.63828403758352
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey.	16.637680456049473
Not there.	5.015111307238985
In the trousers I left off.	12.385385282746716
Must get it.	5.313273947345748
Potato I have.	6.937535202833771
Creaky wardrobe.	14.833002552262101
No use disturbing her.	5.848395241707266
She turned over sleepily that time.	6.430378860297109
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold, a limp lid.	11.271079588952583
Looked shut.	9.590083934049536
All right till I come back anyhow.	13.818875832636584
He crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive.	11.120251279896753
The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church.	8.483336964525444
Specially in these black clothes feel it more.	6.741477212523788
But I couldn’t go in that light suit.	14.060275186555
Make a picnic of it.	5.314923127991699
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth.	8.137150913518267
Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.	10.691632428219497
Makes you feel young.	11.88737184849687
Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at dawn.	11.964249668528772
Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him.	9.364442138546472
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.	13.602103399916635
Walk along a strand, strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear.	12.954392192330582
Turbaned faces going by.	6.448742901588498
Dark caves of carpet shops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled pipe.	6.530536303661583
Cries of sellers in the streets.	14.591228420179247
Dander along all day.	5.692637715313956
Well, meet him.	8.10517164196026
Getting on to sundown.	19.488859109749242
The shadows of the mosques among the pillars: priest with a scroll rolled up.	10.079862509947722
A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind.	13.24959291548937
I pass on.	6.146926305739849
Fading gold sky.	8.261026679541223
A mother watches me from her doorway.	11.596254660632678
She calls her children home in their dark language.	11.323638811704233
High wall: beyond strings twanged.	7.275571962942888
Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new garters.	8.083413561201498
Strings.	32.172570290454246
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers.	12.439380264593206
I pass.	9.53236228608465
Probably not a bit like it really.	15.559393756774405
Kind of stuff you read: in the track of the sun.	13.24652606729488
Sunburst on the titlepage.	24.990742891006427
He smiled, pleasing himself.	5.95464737659296
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the _Freeman_ leader: a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland.	11.179385483398281
He prolonged his pleased smile.	6.217728373402352
Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in the northwest.	9.184375283120788
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter.	9.200071953960283
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush.	7.938214068996437
Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.	14.296166878371393
For instance M’Auley’s down there: n.	15.230631234079373
g.	22.307214335724723
as position.	10.053221221999014
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.	14.127345628817862
Baldhead over the blind.	14.139199480739839
Cute old codger.	11.561040928349744
No use canvassing him for an ad.	12.694475407098365
Still he knows his own business best.	12.757390029110406
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up.	12.419744687538962
Do you know what I’m going to tell you?	12.64164222790518
What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?	16.47251822439226
Do you know what?	13.568509202044062
The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.	12.184372403866263
Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps.	11.155084509446226
Sad thing about poor Dignam, Mr O’Rourke.	11.113857948537404
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway: —Good day, Mr O’Rourke.	13.111408075195891
—Good day to you.	6.640436185640183
—’Tis all that.	6.177044718878066
Where do they get the money?	16.301002708841267
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar.	10.8293745544924
Then, lo and behold, they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons.	8.192060666645544
Then think of the competition.	20.595183698134203
General thirst.	11.308115195751736
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub.	8.874500743756794
Save it they can’t.	6.586537459568521
Off the drunks perhaps.	6.369071379959844
Put down three and carry five.	8.038872269465589
What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs.	11.749716174834694
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers.	13.10791431397617
Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job, see?	11.010886795000918
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month?	15.605617448336016
Say ten barrels of stuff.	7.659778868819963
Say he got ten per cent off.	8.340155671395623
O more.	6.573328550076725
Fifteen.	22.307214335724723
He passed Saint Joseph’s National school.	13.295153733025407
Brats’ clamour.	11.84332815000672
Windows open.	7.796576974338742
Fresh air helps memory.	6.739720347471064
Or a lilt.	14.654550913330578
Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou.	6.520082212468344
Boys are they?	10.644254508583558
Inishturk.	32.172570290454246
Inishark.	32.172570290454246
Inishboffin.	32.172570290454246
At their joggerfry.	14.39748796890142
Mine.	32.172570290454246
Slieve Bloom.	5.117806496024259
He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies, black and white.	9.925027588560084
Fifteen multiplied by.	6.488587218065525
The figures whitened in his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade.	10.438713700753729
The shiny links, packed with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.	5.907507964072428
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last.	9.891796738080734
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter.	15.574704811210863
Would she buy it too, calling the items from a slip in her hand?	12.701425097916166
Chapped: washingsoda.	11.563683322789208
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.	15.516098601885053
Woods his name is.	6.34227466116493
Wonder what he does.	12.119683090957485
Wife is oldish.	11.563180554370694
New blood.	9.650211672574493
No followers allowed.	9.433723557418372
Strong pair of arms.	10.790745822043409
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline.	15.911015575806807
She does whack it, by George.	12.274432351627643
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack.	8.838535552320101
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers, sausagepink.	8.882033342100152
Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.	11.731506220531353
Can become ideal winter sanatorium.	8.629739924256866
Moses Montefiore.	14.833002552262101
I thought he was.	6.80589549176939
Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattle cropping.	10.39180616364533
He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling.	12.991298400330361
A young white heifer.	10.643555941045113
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	8.580486330410588
He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest.	8.723002777117912
The crooked skirt swinging, whack by whack by whack.	6.648034259450894
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace.	9.433588922582178
—Now, my miss, he said.	6.007079872894983
She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.	6.182756707703068
—Thank you, my miss.	12.69065608377527
And one shilling threepence change.	8.622200860853043
For you, please?	23.21971895606066
Mr Bloom pointed quickly.	16.16590262695644
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly, behind her moving hams.	12.720348274776011
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning.	10.420067961294667
Hurry up, damn it.	6.716234073718054
Make hay while the sun shines.	14.535023723559421
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right.	7.351651851963601
He sighed down his nose: they never understand.	12.334957536113457
Sodachapped hands.	6.369743715298307
Crusted toenails too.	4.471046639685607
Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.	5.151124201043229
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast.	5.286905493215376
For another: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane.	9.525397432537362
They like them sizeable.	13.553067048686476
Prime sausage.	14.949365283168918
O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the wood.	15.305783916083525
—Threepence, please.	5.694696591715467
His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.	7.002737733340375
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles.	11.656692616743115
They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.	8.274774576710296
—Thank you, sir.	5.62439517330094
Another time.	5.108055618187879
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him.	4.484861873073133
He withdrew his gaze after an instant.	8.90274928841254
No: better not: another time.	7.123480747558976
—Good morning, he said, moving away.	9.739995190260103
—Good morning, sir.	6.113019010045597
No sign.	9.606731075637938
Gone.	17.705247751504768
What matter?	14.345196370023269
He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely.	12.398094344956014
Agendath Netaim: planters’ company.	7.839177636812328
To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant with eucalyptus trees.	5.6313709276408375
Excellent for shade, fuel and construction.	7.1103259560978485
Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.	7.521879045839571
You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons.	7.01688922048427
Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial irrigation.	6.613698885275076
Every year you get a sending of the crop.	15.884094070335461
Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union.	12.820223273429235
Can pay ten down and the balance in yearly instalments.	10.360086647352578
Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W.	7.455012152223057
15.	10.030312065435044
Nothing doing.	13.360389952091404
Still an idea behind it.	5.3790622908997845
He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat.	11.005372722090788
Silverpowdered olivetrees.	14.509135749322695
Quiet long days: pruning, ripening.	7.616471856680114
Olives are packed in jars, eh?	5.565157511053025
I have a few left from Andrews.	15.364297239420532
Molly spitting them out.	5.138197019403522
Knows the taste of them now.	7.0363831963929435
Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates.	8.741953803249247
Citrons too.	4.66219583534958
Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade.	13.054328663483878
And Mastiansky with the old cither.	17.640416856892582
Pleasant evenings we had then.	7.74339223597771
Molly in Citron’s basketchair.	22.04351262284919
Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume.	8.624037790096063
Like that, heavy, sweet, wild perfume.	9.192488343878155
Always the same, year after year.	7.300397432503831
They fetched high prices too, Moisel told me.	5.590252829486848
Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.	7.366350018974714
Must be without a flaw, he said.	7.087317109558602
Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant.	11.993193042780648
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees.	8.439795225205938
There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of.	12.422899862270755
How do you?	8.601888193989673
Doesn’t see.	7.811804892705612
Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore.	17.18728421143947
His back is like that Norwegian captain’s.	7.755860029935284
Wonder if I’ll meet him today.	12.20609340647324
To provoke the rain.	6.882954211207152
On earth as it is in heaven.	11.123811034900227
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly.	10.58142723125511
Grey.	32.172570290454246
Far.	18.814633242637697
No, not like that.	9.96211889060812
A barren land, bare waste.	10.914989534720561
Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth.	9.229491131162408
Brimstone they called it raining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom.	9.604453418622857
All dead names.	8.29048521204363
A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old.	11.697727338816257
Old now.	4.779330306107821
It bore the oldest, the first race.	10.319036095867169
A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck.	8.111495439554437
The oldest people.	7.591348608528878
Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born everywhere.	8.51632028929572
It lay there now.	5.8559827736769625
Now it could bear no more.	6.2753863210017435
Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.	9.876750118652344
Desolation.	32.172570290454246
Grey horror seared his flesh.	6.230251936680893
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward.	13.330677796429159
Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak.	7.275171060813878
Well, I am here now.	10.884567503551207
Yes, I am here now.	11.098377955064649
Morning mouth bad images.	10.161479080127457
Got up wrong side of the bed.	8.675554119800237
Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises.	12.81144046433031
Blotchy brown brick houses.	7.298245396374781
Number eighty still unlet.	9.690981253601576
Why is that?	7.983697459296251
Valuation is only twentyeight.	12.118628513145053
Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills.	5.420496685770783
Plasters on a sore eye.	11.095361633603734
To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.	8.220139341272962
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh.	7.872437605734622
Yes, yes.	10.329998245355132
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals, along the brightening footpath.	8.264712940365248
Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with gold hair on the wind.	16.431610333695676
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor.	19.42751157845061
He stooped and gathered them.	5.011343931609665
Mrs Marion Bloom.	5.95484222353316
His quickened heart slowed at once.	5.346658273683624
Bold hand.	5.515639280824359
Mrs Marion.	9.266061138508881
—Poldy! Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head.	6.714886680474247
—Who are the letters for?	17.456004844367687
He looked at them.	7.41617603401665
Milly.	25.535385961793953
—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you.	12.886241958300035
And a letter for you.	8.769663994080863
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.	10.929872791855914
—Do you want the blind up?	9.497723869604279
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.	8.61568225721948
—That do?	14.848159801077436
he asked, turning.	10.301074468063334
She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.	12.658215187285206
—She got the things, she said.	6.359593154888645
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh.	12.374291259966332
—Hurry up with that tea, she said.	7.275542123353307
I’m parched.	23.31903927922339
—The kettle is boiling, he said.	5.970599625618907
But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.	9.67348543963866
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called: —Poldy! —What?	16.50361641758936
—Scald the teapot.	9.073320022275903
On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout.	14.691664368812367
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in.	8.197874293549432
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.	9.817877098358265
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him.	5.326158083812552
Give her too much meat she won’t mouse.	14.505083612788095
Say they won’t eat pork.	12.586515779954231
Kosher.	22.307214335724723
Here.	12.056869439375285
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce.	8.21600542277019
Pepper.	32.172570290454246
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.	13.300269111945571
Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over.	9.170398255270639
Thanks: new tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls.	6.844838568281476
The tea was drawn.	9.109079892479594
He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.	6.887063684920622
Only five she was then.	8.532997109742075
No, wait: four.	12.896200035135369
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke.	9.387824360681332
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her.	8.481241459440591
He smiled, pouring.	10.987601501583768
O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.	17.749892992823902
You are my lookingglass from night to morning.	7.034862394383268
Dreadful old case.	7.684866680010832
Still he was a courteous old chap.	12.235768534956716
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform.	13.48898044389583
And the little mirror in his silk hat.	15.81308786345459
The night Milly brought it into the parlour.	14.381220877864633
O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed.	14.106966718316384
Sex breaking out even then.	5.944119182933839
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapot on the tray.	10.318660643901719
Its hump bumped as he took it up.	7.607834717790893
Everything on it?	7.865191537770405
Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream.	8.969952698082418
He carried it upstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.	15.409726298080272
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead.	15.404981850826738
—What a time you were! she said.	7.252476037606875
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on the pillow.	10.58021521573521
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder.	11.891262184581622
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.	14.124757665260992
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow.	7.5986357690972826
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.	9.832972027118183
—Who was the letter from?	21.804914329016523
he asked.	5.571194519539272
Bold hand.	5.515639280824359
Marion.	16.086285145227123
—O, Boylan, she said.	7.259955369948816
He’s bringing the programme.	14.522772591875185
—What are you singing?	23.432350635365264
—_Là ci darem_ with J.	4.129714836212993
C.	8.56499542248637
Doyle, she said, and _Love’s Old Sweet Song_.	14.7157769145745
Her full lips, drinking, smiled.	8.120570973592685
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day.	5.077439378127051
Like foul flowerwater.	11.603012792531171
—Would you like the window open a little?	17.351668924552925
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking: —What time is the funeral?	12.910177048654923
—Eleven, I think, he answered.	10.834073146398003
I didn’t see the paper.	9.397835383590564
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed.	13.427271607995483
No?	20.267449269082853
Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.	8.909238980429254
—No: that book.	11.995757747228279
Other stocking.	10.409341583386572
Her petticoat.	12.687564347435067
—It must have fell down, she said.	8.6032217300515
He felt here and there.	5.9604283276596455
_Voglio e non vorrei_.	9.46230367319968
Wonder if she pronounces that right: _voglio_.	11.808282830526604
Not in the bed.	11.746695742912124
Must have slid down.	7.729559977249607
He stooped and lifted the valance.	9.514261583807944
The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot.	11.804303705909282
—Show here, she said.	5.692511027508349
I put a mark in it.	6.25066359297094
There’s a word I wanted to ask you.	10.886741694500921
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word.	9.797521722087108
—Met him what?	9.810428765022777
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—Here, she said.	5.073796871444855
What does that mean?	10.992059529020564
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.	10.08879723241702
—Metempsychosis?	22.14607483534706
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Who’s he when he’s at home?	11.289771873311159
—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning.	12.294445689882682
It’s Greek: from the Greek.	19.168796881648053
That means the transmigration of souls.	5.854148339900298
—O, rocks! she said.	7.4747665136969825
Tell us in plain words.	9.094389451297932
He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes.	8.077958675197497
The same young eyes.	7.426487233543459
The first night after the charades.	15.822380318771204
Dolphin’s Barn.	18.30283558843349
He turned over the smudged pages.	15.244408787572686
_Ruby: the Pride of the Ring_.	22.890087799141273
Hello.	16.81846716713923
Illustration.	32.172570290454246
Fierce Italian with carriagewhip.	10.864969397537338
Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.	14.391307673498135

_The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath_.	9.928696585155585
Cruelty behind it all.	6.458937106279754
Doped animals.	12.693542893567423
Trapeze at Hengler’s.	4.431486042255488
Had to look the other way.	8.374624984781027
Mob gaping.	15.12026821030883
Break your neck and we’ll break our sides.	10.558251956923607
Families of them.	5.0918251516177016
Bone them young so they metamspychosis.	11.355254925725742
That we live after death.	7.098672961592697
Our souls.	10.027104322780568
That a man’s soul after he dies.	12.672143054760943
Dignam’s soul...	5.213948634534719
—Did you finish it?	9.672544739243927
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—Yes, she said.	5.118090027010154
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time?	14.405122000110584
—Never read it.	4.989054373514516
Do you want another?	25.38136838225487
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Get another of Paul de Kock’s.	4.934942938810096
Nice name he has.	9.2887845462842
She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.	10.394985295379323
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to Kearney, my guarantor.	11.686078397149492
Reincarnation: that’s the word.	8.151447969732832
—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body after death, that we lived before.	10.908063145982167
They call it reincarnation.	17.27185329562112
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet.	14.384183345420496
They say we have forgotten it.	9.171542307791274
Some say they remember their past lives.	8.272260809802987
The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea.	5.992281148514453
Better remind her of the word: metempsychosis.	12.213925844619924
An example would be better.	10.354167213353708
An example?	21.562789143302076
The _Bath of the Nymph_ over the bed.	11.755776234203076
Given away with the Easter number of _Photo Bits_: Splendid masterpiece in art colours.	8.558392080175725
Tea before you put milk in.	8.15126508024658
Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer.	14.049247346003144
Three and six I gave for the frame.	18.618730376738863
She said it would look nice over the bed.	12.609215067228368
Naked nymphs: Greece: and for instance all the people that lived then.	9.818702160942664
He turned the pages back.	7.56930040788264
—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it.	7.321076157068715
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance.	13.56858530557836
What they called nymphs, for example.	11.260505491132157
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar.	12.247064648410545
She gazed straight before her, inhaling through her arched nostrils.	8.955245460906864
—There’s a smell of burn, she said.	6.868012384593442
Did you leave anything on the fire?	23.175564856436356
—The kidney! he cried suddenly.	15.387802247490468
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes against the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs.	10.738155910046515
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan.	14.807928793464596
Only a little burnt.	23.86466321759485
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.	7.273930265646504
Cup of tea now.	6.737792700620432
He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.	10.84178300390688
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat.	9.7177975630816
Then he put a forkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat.	8.375877348428483
Done to a turn.	15.364827171201112
A mouthful of tea.	6.373528741287561
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	10.421668206931413
What was that about some young student and a picnic?	18.72045004129546
He creased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.	10.831565770771855
Dearest Papli Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present.	12.840880242239862
It suits me splendid.	7.848371119494238
Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam.	14.980098389315469
I got mummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing.	10.80859640853218
They are lovely.	14.548291553051223
I am getting on swimming in the photo business now.	12.720723960985936
Mr Coghlan took one of me and Mrs.	13.386995718150848
Will send when developed.	8.915344093428562
We did great biz yesterday.	7.919101253400756
Fair day and all the beef to the heels were in.	10.484657222532679
Give my love to mummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks.	9.732254284823071
I hear them at the piano downstairs.	19.392842472369207
There is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his cousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the pop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls.	9.343482405256335
Tell him silly Milly sends my best respects.	10.14743066067876
I must now close with fondest love Your fond daughter Milly P.	6.002032235024592
Excuse bad writing am in hurry.	8.601810226296935
Byby.	32.172570290454246
Fifteen yesterday.	10.633544184499792
Curious, fifteenth of the month too.	8.198338305118394
Her first birthday away from home.	8.808503679659758
Separation.	32.172570290454246
Remember the summer morning she was born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street.	7.865327557199002
Jolly old woman.	8.095163727642229
Lot of babies she must have helped into the world.	9.25678757254443
She knew from the first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live.	17.528241161862912
Well, God is good, sir.	9.425167333022799
She knew at once.	7.583465314326945
He would be eleven now if he had lived.	17.301868493794434
His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript.	10.478280196461892
Excuse bad writing.	8.302028682097456
Hurry.	25.535385961793953
Piano downstairs.	11.219211239039288
Coming out of her shell.	19.471217285829418
Row with her in the XL Café about the bracelet.	15.798939448595622
Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.	8.73578133756958
Saucebox.	32.172570290454246
He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney.	8.180935338698008
Twelve and six a week.	8.380224226842863
Not much.	9.609654127308
Still, she might do worse.	14.643540632219386
Music hall stage.	10.359895304649129
Young student.	9.175398092422556
He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal.	9.252196313790114
Then he read the letter again: twice.	13.725307754528203
O, well: she knows how to mind herself.	14.95633029116567
But if not?	11.142183431675928
No, nothing has happened.	17.806023654731703
Of course it might.	14.258693314924052
Wait in any case till it does.	9.789811502740767
A wild piece of goods.	10.423860647950928
Her slim legs running up the staircase.	8.046044476069898
Destiny.	25.535385961793953
Ripening now.	4.779330306107821
Vain: very.	12.413906275987435
He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window.	11.83285188168433
Day I caught her in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red.	11.19961277817887
Anemic a little.	11.270660196013813
Was given milk too long.	7.332384750108911
On the _Erin’s King_ that day round the Kish.	20.636167536396158
Damned old tub pitching about.	5.3420408321806025
Not a bit funky.	26.462262620685458
Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind with her hair.	9.960416148359739
Seaside girls.	8.680661448087399
Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey off for the day, singing.	12.19838381510577
Friend of the family.	16.627401771416594
Swurls, he says.	11.44138118953727
Pier with lamps, summer evening, band.	6.988737679890767
Those girls, those girls, Those lovely seaside girls.	7.504427569535005
Milly too.	4.873726383412218
Young kisses: the first.	8.110515798058662
Far away now past.	9.339114320924894
Mrs Marion.	9.266061138508881
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	9.80591896930517
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	6.905351316518224
Will happen, yes.	5.4457985771541635
Prevent.	32.172570290454246
Useless: can’t move.	14.353925875931944
Girl’s sweet light lips.	9.980132544223212
Will happen too.	5.146640148909157
He felt the flowing qualm spread over him.	4.833398168084675
Useless to move now.	6.590928903405828
Lips kissed, kissing, kissed.	8.389652461754801
Full gluey woman’s lips.	8.593442273067854
Better where she is down there: away.	9.840846189932394
Occupy her.	4.892668042093682
Wanted a dog to pass the time.	5.337322473148701
Might take a trip down there.	6.90811191384926
August bank holiday, only two and six return.	8.885576779888673
Six weeks off, however.	8.5268189800857
Might work a press pass.	8.944593254154924
Or through M’Coy.	7.631460686306742
The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosed at it and stalked to the door.	9.808258260058542
She looked back at him, mewing.	15.057096066479469
Wants to go out.	8.60081320719603
Wait before a door sometime it will open.	8.967285944849108
Let her wait.	7.989830999738607
Has the fidgets.	16.39531042347814
Electric.	32.172570290454246
Thunder in the air.	9.354000558839903
Was washing at her ear with her back to the fire too.	12.255859979870005
He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels.	13.422171194496899
He stood up, undoing the waistband of his trousers.	9.80093954325739
The cat mewed to him.	5.099810812020441
Wait till I’m ready.	12.280540075178346
Heaviness: hot day coming.	6.527666385351597
Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the landing.	13.52091612312917
A paper.	7.428392500597954
He liked to read at stool.	10.832440196851854
Hope no ape comes knocking just as I’m.	7.491314165094461
In the tabledrawer he found an old number of _Titbits_.	16.041433626732303
He folded it under his armpit, went to the door and opened it.	8.249191660836829
The cat went up in soft bounds.	13.886984391055531
Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.	14.3230813154697
Listening, he heard her voice: —Come, come, pussy.	15.04657573760431
He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards the next garden.	15.510776737322669
Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.	9.692507187663534
The maid was in the garden.	11.403183765382362
Fine morning.	6.585177647034318
He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.	8.001077139515553
Make a summerhouse here.	6.373930708416981
Scarlet runners.	14.949365283168918
Virginia creepers.	14.509135749322695
A coat of liver of sulphur.	8.808878359941893
All soil like that without dung.	11.854041148355579
Household slops.	15.045831905306336
Loam, what is this that is?	14.973789767511212
Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes.	12.669641438959829
Mulch of dung.	10.877398440342741
Best thing to clean ladies’ kid gloves.	10.10027027993797
Ashes too.	4.66219583534958
Reclaim the whole place.	9.695760247986696
Grow peas in that corner there.	7.922622072585725
Lettuce.	32.172570290454246
Always have fresh greens then.	5.306374827317806
Still gardens have their drawbacks.	10.597665470856741
That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.	8.846652335431418
He walked on.	5.968325595406214
Where is my hat, by the way?	17.61414846524091
Must have put it back on the peg.	22.275325370751673
Or hanging up on the floor.	9.198160160434009
Funny I don’t remember that.	7.498526548025271
Hallstand too full.	8.091328659381805
Four umbrellas, her raincloak.	15.300028056181937
Picking up the letters.	11.413869800179329
Drago’s shopbell ringing.	22.49392662227063
Queer I was just thinking that moment.	9.65289367749468
Brown brillantined hair over his collar.	11.711346905928146
Just had a wash and brushup.	13.703857172777015
Wonder have I time for a bath this morning.	10.45276471340333
Tara street.	5.378221385528375
Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say.	8.653274723740353
O’Brien.	20.807048806792892
Agendath what is it?	6.839878448074304
Now, my miss.	18.337532463940928
Enthusiast.	32.172570290454246
He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes.	13.512641670253013
Better be careful not to get these trousers dirty for the funeral.	12.941824711451165
He went in, bowing his head under the low lintel.	16.18245923398694
Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces.	6.860846807203716
Before sitting down he peered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows.	10.630207393348554
Nobody.	22.307214335724723
Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on his bared knees.	12.560459930843523
Something new and easy.	10.035966172199425
Keep it a bit.	9.791772683289832
Our prize titbit: _Matcham’s Masterstroke_.	14.022536758603376
Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London.	6.649588330860807
Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to the writer.	14.485697209814145
Three and a half.	14.203323230567635
Three pounds three.	10.246487789556049
Three pounds, thirteen and six.	6.1470144340236095
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second.	8.118672449777916
Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone.	8.457915142312412
Hope it’s not too big bring on piles again.	7.984377425971679
No, just right.	13.907078173094684
So. Ah! Costive.	15.735772344771414
One tabloid of cascara sagrada.	7.405282803154288
Life might be so.	9.372209799103699
It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat.	13.579065863445791
Print anything now.	4.718599416294848
Silly season.	15.07044042909492
He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell.	13.505600184110419
Neat certainly.	10.663141283966198
_Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now_.	11.41674829453437
Begins and ends morally.	9.881874691115756
_Hand in hand_.	10.066801027325003
Smart.	32.172570290454246
He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.	10.903290703091669
Might manage a sketch.	9.081474554330626
By Mr and Mrs L.	7.61733635048084
Bloom.	7.595351801251561
Invent a story for some proverb.	12.820862869880164
Which?	22.307214335724716
Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she said dressing.	14.706641089045455
Dislike dressing together.	6.9293075940389555
Nicked myself shaving.	11.883372914302765
Biting her nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt.	7.289528514290334
Timing her.	4.892668042093682
9.15.	7.317220062941935
Did Roberts pay you yet?	9.814640455782719
9.20.	7.317220062941935
What had Gretta Conroy on?	10.169677420813544
9.23.	7.317220062941935
What possessed me to buy this comb?	15.661758152583909
9.24.	7.317220062941935
I’m swelled after that cabbage.	15.695562241328512
A speck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.	12.786597013451173
Rubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf.	8.153409139081042
Morning after the bazaar dance when May’s band played Ponchielli’s dance of the hours.	14.313223078844128
Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then night hours.	10.854351487603598
Washing her teeth.	7.656971733317347
That was the first night.	10.972926704309483
Her head dancing.	10.978684536533317
Her fansticks clicking.	10.53625214251107
Is that Boylan well off?	14.105061239151253
He has money.	10.975740179348298
Why?	12.512270304170855
I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing.	14.538600891172113
No use humming then.	7.419848515902165
Allude to it.	4.120058545014285
Strange kind of music that last night.	8.811900181152259
The mirror was in shadow.	12.612560156495405
She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub.	8.898215881765866
Peering into it.	4.133758034890022
Lines in her eyes.	7.585571174827371
It wouldn’t pan out somehow.	12.328684852703157
Night hours then: black with daggers and eyemasks.	6.372807216499197
Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.	12.979555420572137
Still, true to life also.	12.014220574993367
Day: then the night.	7.549274332091697
He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.	5.8068043692025455
Then he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself.	8.06832449938563
He pulled back the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.	11.624865415802217
In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his black trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.	12.881451345495025
What time is the funeral?	18.352320662894
Better find out in the paper.	10.206450349858379
A creak and a dark whirr in the air high up.	11.156892992453697
The bells of George’s church.	9.954866370962723
They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.	8.021160925688333
Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Heigho! Quarter to.	5.444536534035051
There again: the overtone following through the air.	8.888520264081434
A third.	15.16700344379725
Could have given that address too.	6.353102699922717
And past the sailors’ home.	7.5087342283204235
He turned from the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.	13.086893757760372
By Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking a chewed fagbutt.	11.288753708143071
A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop.	8.973498993857277
Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.	17.554854740067846
O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of roses.	15.615149554723768
Waiting outside pubs to bring da home.	6.602296859588036
Come home to ma, da.	11.608889505689351
Slack hour: won’t be many there.	7.939002155343981
He crossed Townsend street, passed the frowning face of Bethel.	12.294610475689932
El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.	8.962754762670754
And past Nichols’ the undertaker.	8.855501915111118
At eleven it is.	4.922205033076908
Time enough.	9.495695440594261
Daresay Corny Kelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s.	7.1350376708034595
Singing with his eyes shut.	15.055251652035915
Corny.	32.172570290454246
Met her once in the park.	11.095120199500364
In the dark.	13.683332979061385
What a lark.	14.893251224610017
Police tout.	14.509135749322695
Her name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.	10.300210005675059
O, surely he bagged it.	7.235237271296662
Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall.	15.79586239817181
With my tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.	5.414036671808301
In Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental Tea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend, finest quality, family tea.	6.398214233084007
Rather warm.	10.107155143858003
Tea.	20.267449269082853
Must get some from Tom Kernan.	9.65900227417393
Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though.	13.520545622575025
While his eyes still read blandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace over his brow and hair.	9.587938265169125
Very warm morning.	6.119201068667416
Under their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha.	9.539996924959771
Just there.	5.015111307238985
His right hand came down into the bowl of his hat.	12.56104842597922
His fingers found quickly a card behind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.	8.73363733157831
So warm.	10.107155143858003
His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair.	9.631581590933397
Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of the finest Ceylon brands.	15.494513451929533
The far east.	8.907094079513628
Lovely spot it must be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them.	6.739796168696723
Wonder is it like that.	8.22037192665061
Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in _dolce far niente_, not doing a hand’s turn all day.	8.798206841287707
Sleep six months out of twelve.	12.889572075085535
Too hot to quarrel.	9.756026114522133
Influence of the climate.	29.193196400896362
Lethargy.	32.172570290454246
Flowers of idleness.	11.564058977322793
The air feeds most.	10.591949656186442
Azotes.	32.172570290454246
Hothouse in Botanic gardens.	8.085767650249228
Sensitive plants.	12.570867676935075
Waterlilies.	32.172570290454246
Petals too tired to.	5.298821267427023
Sleeping sickness in the air.	8.045602572295207
Walk on roseleaves.	13.281951957347482
Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel.	12.518615503083094
Where was the chap I saw in that picture somewhere?	17.561411882733854
Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his back, reading a book with a parasol open.	12.64562310013232
Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thick with salt.	12.891432388387017
Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in the water is equal to the weight of the what?	15.119644836343475
Or is it the volume is equal to the weight?	13.055366244413886
It’s a law something like that.	7.9286843788810515
Vance in High school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching.	7.187536055885807
The college curriculum.	9.989338908970684
Cracking curriculum.	12.200680240034972
What is weight really when you say the weight?	15.493682254739834
Thirtytwo feet per second per second.	7.333435790223004
Law of falling bodies: per second per second.	6.863547030409198
They all fall to the ground.	10.346586005407785
The earth.	7.977986318297318
It’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.	13.905549673403769
He turned away and sauntered across the road.	9.844935809414396
How did she walk with her sausages?	20.389356234790373
Like that something.	11.717765227913985
As he walked he took the folded _Freeman_ from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg.	11.13520801360606
Careless air: just drop in to see.	7.6349781661243785
Per second per second.	7.527087875847539
Per second for every second it means.	9.62120488301474
From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice.	13.713735015504016
Too late box.	11.471523302739971
Post here.	5.336865107850044
No-one.	5.902168489772398
In. He handed the card through the brass grill.	14.37240637877714
—Are there any letters for me?	11.35867857771335
he asked.	5.571194519539272
While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting poster with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper.	8.73357393812219
No answer probably.	7.931244964320287
Went too far last time.	6.251087065156531
The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter.	11.192315389205955
He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.	12.735571035472992
Henry Flower Esq, c/o P.	5.98623336927019
Answered anyhow.	7.574208574944725
He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewing again the soldiers on parade.	7.344051157854306
Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?	23.897732311050614
Castoff soldier.	15.111906281989787
There: bearskin cap and hackle plume.	8.602698138035759
No, he’s a grenadier.	16.80155230970517
Pointed cuffs.	11.144207781784782
There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers.	11.648803516779386
Redcoats.	32.172570290454246
That must be why the women go after them.	9.949209363169237
Uniform.	32.172570290454246
Easier to enlist and drill.	7.288509400475188
Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.	12.834201018471681
Griffith’s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or halfseasover empire.	9.206747014906465
Half baked they look: hypnotised like.	6.509222699635999
Eyes front.	10.09568017083373
Table: able.	11.953855227163174
Bed: ed.	11.563683322789208
The King’s own.	11.334084315810513
Never see him dressed up as a fireman or a bobby.	16.761751369507394
A mason, yes.	5.2076780415981165
He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right.	9.86005190893637
Talk: as if that would mend matters.	13.040349205274051
His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.	12.90940779959238
Women will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think.	8.997958063799075
His fingers drew forth the letter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket.	6.984694046146884
Something pinned on: photo perhaps.	7.270399131027313
Hair?	32.172570290454246
No. M’Coy.	12.346216244910147
Get rid of him quickly.	12.089648802396118
Take me out of my way.	10.080946285585108
Hate company when you.	4.772469926033166
—Hello, Bloom.	5.318540593730976
—Hello, M’Coy.	9.24044862136083
Nowhere in particular.	9.937320987438605
—How’s the body?	18.120123016222507
—Fine.	16.26971171505175
How are you?	8.709020383894423
—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.	5.143044689659344
His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect: —Is there any...	8.729970722350226
no trouble I hope?	14.897502331075962
I see you’re...	4.261635021428888
—O, no, Mr Bloom said.	6.316505601456315
Poor Dignam, you know.	8.414461308614593
The funeral is today.	5.669688684514281
—To be sure, poor fellow.	10.159210527125095
So it is.	5.802333038461542
What time?	12.626263682897264
A photo it isn’t.	5.38190581024386
A badge maybe.	10.09222943664731
—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.	9.602411786632779
—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said.	11.721129214761785
Eleven, is it?	7.912709832914772
I only heard it last night.	8.754200021943285
Who was telling me?	10.118238790419724
Holohan.	32.172570290454246
You know Hoppy?	24.335987682900747
—I know.	9.453943313848677
Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor.	19.036544319754505
The porter hoisted the valise up on the well.	7.418625022382811
She stood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change.	9.634837795741099
Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth.	12.03042073280938
Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets.	11.663046074666015
Like that haughty creature at the polo match.	14.314068856002852
Women all for caste till you touch the spot.	9.18714585845243
Reserved about to yield.	15.598141269408618
The honourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man.	6.667874277640725
—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons.	13.616882989050481
Just down there in Conway’s we were.	10.462305673498555
Doran Lyons in Conway’s.	4.632279915936112
She raised a gloved hand to her hair.	9.705284352251075
In came Hoppy.	13.586485398318123
Having a wet.	9.49599668755827
Clearly I can see today.	10.311239519162374
Moisture about gives long sight perhaps.	5.585213437418383
Lady’s hand.	8.506073203278097
Which side will she get up?	8.592655576312069
—And he said: _Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?_ I said.	8.602979317077422
Off to the country: Broadstone probably.	10.55588419719004
High brown boots with laces dangling.	7.991118025466949
Wellturned foot.	8.717303563769882
Sees me looking.	9.367805368956263
Eye out for other fellow always.	13.076373031548625
Good fallback.	14.509135749322695
Two strings to her bow.	12.338055282893748
—_Why?_ I said.	5.204696545150226
_What’s wrong with him?_ I said.	10.57348175022875
Proud: rich: silk stockings.	6.4662299034453055
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	5.018818707065021
He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head.	11.46032184889244
Getting up in a minute.	12.807556582633307
—_What’s wrong with him_?	16.409888690046408
He said.	3.4792754023705177
_He’s dead_, he said.	7.905549224782157
And, faith, he filled up.	11.30882294761647
_Is it Paddy Dignam_?	12.40678494804774
I said.	3.443412711484532
I couldn’t believe it when I heard it.	10.862218122621062
I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in the Arch.	13.43051623096507
_Yes,_ he said.	4.4315540208366855
_He’s gone.	11.909888856354891
He died on Monday, poor fellow_.	14.841781323654427
Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white.	7.774925550010785
Watch! A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.	9.13907231499522
Lost it.	3.903055991727408
Curse your noisy pugnose.	10.977728339701867
Feels locked out of it.	4.6801294084794005
Paradise and the peri.	23.678232208525916
Always happening like that.	4.549890582034828
The very moment.	7.999159759143073
Girl in Eustace street hallway Monday was it settling her garter.	9.65946361509537
Her friend covering the display of.	4.9098257580188935
_Esprit de corps_.	11.542930578058101
Well, what are you gaping at?	19.52634231524216
—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh.	11.400044618610504
Another gone.	6.998686201433826
—One of the best, M’Coy said.	6.34701143081481
The tram passed.	8.61412453626845
They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip.	12.133861042460914
Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun: flicker, flick.	10.96733279174101
—Wife well, I suppose?	13.908327131873822
M’Coy’s changed voice said.	7.862782411303318
—O, yes, Mr Bloom said.	6.107574689396018
Tiptop, thanks.	7.752786668041321
He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly: What is home without Plumtree’s Potted Meat?	10.355642878550189
With it an abode of bliss.	6.89745115939626
—My missus has just got an engagement.	10.691756463765058
At least it’s not settled yet.	10.4467447617036
Valise tack again.	5.0571389463697525
By the way no harm.	13.096307528286614
I’m off that, thanks.	13.376210407247394
Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.	11.560866207037126
—My wife too, he said.	6.235968107288422
She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the Ulster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.	15.834362311667059
—That so?	13.082647577254129
M’Coy said.	4.452887860895002
Glad to hear that, old man.	9.87094568236371
Who’s getting it up?	15.771213275171808
Mrs Marion Bloom.	5.95484222353316
Not up yet.	7.512885831435846
Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.	12.002573906263718
Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens.	6.790458161576547
Dark lady and fair man.	5.326168260793323
Letter.	32.172570290454246
Cat furry black ball.	7.221317237281731
Torn strip of envelope.	8.51713192441564
Love’s Old Sweet Song Comes lo-ove’s old...	5.770528869612023
—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.	13.160995682358037
_Sweeeet song_.	14.509135749322695
There’s a committee formed.	16.03915516311147
Part shares and part profits.	7.846222204643011
M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.	14.393272118561104
—O, well, he said.	5.915279147728915
That’s good news.	14.01585509731004
He moved to go.	8.339515518688078
—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said.	7.139839810925856
Meet you knocking around.	8.423167622754404
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	5.018818707065021
—Tell you what, M’Coy said.	5.315241885908477
You might put down my name at the funeral, will you?	11.067845560574398
I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see.	13.045579227107153
There’s a drowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to go down if the body is found.	10.953067767921178
—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off.	11.449803189540914
—Right, M’Coy said brightly.	10.354939457714321
Thanks, old man.	8.017114841690145
I’d go if I possibly could.	16.097847965380083
Well, tolloll.	25.92140747590526
Just C.	5.446206677749058
M’Coy will do.	9.524843934657207
—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.	16.64237768361071
Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze.	10.975041288362842
The quick touch.	8.300806707595552
Soft mark.	11.42439294706638
I’d like my job.	16.006792271804546
Valise I have a particular fancy for.	10.929004065389247
Leather.	32.172570290454246
Capped corners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock.	5.87227994114635
Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day to this.	10.645991433880239
Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled.	10.789827409217047
My missus has just got an.	8.88049673311209
Reedy freckled soprano.	9.557797514192897
Cheeseparing nose.	7.919999973657108
Nice enough in its way: for a little ballad.	15.649809584319788
No guts in it.	4.316478593795574
You and me, don’t you know: in the same boat.	13.615597645124902
Softsoaping.	32.172570290454246
Can’t he hear the difference?	15.032078941689637
Think he’s that way inclined a bit.	10.534666705618687
Against my grain somehow.	8.796175809011324
Thought that Belfast would fetch him.	4.154281958629548
I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.	11.19891990219668
Your wife and my wife.	10.737274010067205
Wonder is he pimping after me?	11.661145090109446
Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured hoardings.	18.57478061419161
Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic).	7.198069241030428
Clery’s Summer Sale.	21.98670091168718
No, he’s going on straight.	15.040961257032201
Hello.	16.81846716713923
_Leah_ tonight.	9.252029479130847
Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	8.840235184201532
Like to see her again in that.	9.27714494672429
_Hamlet_ she played last night.	5.506218295422165
Male impersonator.	14.833002552262101
Perhaps he was a woman.	10.297585532683632
Why Ophelia committed suicide.	9.600450086042724
Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that.	7.152651470073416
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in.	8.333331814021768
Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.	16.30944479266514
And Ristori in Vienna.	7.999644886510699
What is this the right name is?	15.167311445683685
By Mosenthal it is.	4.755222384536308
Rachel, is it?	7.172352633569452
No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.	12.071907883246773
Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his father to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father and left the God of his father.	13.94153788033014
Every word is so deep, Leopold.	9.143815704420406
Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face.	11.296053815922633
That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.	10.227399894889759
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard.	15.493834026651014
No use thinking of it any more.	11.318445292920137
Nosebag time.	5.108055618187879
Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow.	10.047112207262364
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.	7.701771664523595
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss.	10.227995484865032
Their Eldorado.	14.509135749322695
Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.	9.336221517939673
Too full for words.	6.044316608034025
Still they get their feed all right and their doss.	14.71259411832294
Gelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches.	10.457615594082661
Might be happy all the same that way.	9.374620601655659
Good poor brutes they look.	6.540524457805108
Still their neigh can be very irritating.	9.516678922779136
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.	13.29493485682446
Might just walk into her here.	6.642648213124051
The lane is safer.	9.72995886195407
He passed the cabman’s shelter.	16.607065709130175
Curious the life of drifting cabbies.	9.77245220790332
All weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own.	8.943589294635622
_Voglio e non_.	11.278723768950407
Like to give them an odd cigarette.	13.969589695903563
Sociable.	32.172570290454246
Shout a few flying syllables as they pass.	11.354337665951267
He hummed: Là ci darem la mano La la lala la la.	6.004372905113153
He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee of the station wall.	14.594892851053315
No-one.	5.902168489772398
Meade’s timberyard.	30.59555375789606
Piled balks.	14.509135749322695
Ruins and tenements.	11.769847407877034
With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgotten pickeystone.	9.520015158354147
Not a sinner.	20.46279764749697
Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb.	7.43350047912102
A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill.	11.112279728194467
Pity to disturb them.	5.310360487231116
Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her.	10.161101639223096
And once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s school.	12.853557187670907
She liked mignonette.	11.519068437052908
And Mr?	21.74523856508023
He opened the letter within the newspaper.	12.427698360161555
A flower.	10.673954716070108
I think it’s a.	8.996234689213825
A yellow flower with flattened petals.	8.734092876965573
Not annoyed then?	8.916296251754728
What does she say?	13.563324458854131
Dear Henry I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it.	9.038839285425112
I am sorry you did not like my last letter.	15.924831226217657
Why did you enclose the stamps?	15.294911534133975
I am awfully angry with you.	7.755558719965394
I do wish I could punish you for that.	9.305374647225493
I called you naughty boy because I do not like that other world.	9.68893664619257
Please tell me what is the real meaning of that word?	16.58304963599673
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	10.908217099894756
I do wish I could do something for you.	9.69992056570915
Please tell me what you think of poor me.	11.062194114565273
I often think of the beautiful name you have.	11.949948303456969
Dear Henry, when will we meet?	13.618805112805653
I think of you so often you have no idea.	13.737495119794698
I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as you.	10.12009847094113
I feel so bad about.	11.32340159263071
Please write me a long letter and tell me more.	11.213685352089396
Remember if you do not I will punish you.	10.595444982688756
So now you know what I will do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote.	15.179351140960618
O how I long to meet you.	7.0059734624738725
Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are exhausted.	9.269231986589917
Then I will tell you all.	9.134172260833031
Goodbye now, naughty darling, I have such a bad headache.	14.693689510725216
today.	10.594970405422256
and write _by return_ to your longing Martha P.	6.71588502492057
Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use.	11.830322531608065
I want to know.	7.862351908272735
He tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell and placed it in his heart pocket.	8.314071524726014
Language of flowers.	10.144496995270712
They like it because no-one can hear.	10.849744813380099
Or a poison bouquet to strike him down.	7.726218451822631
Then walking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word.	8.977340267478233
Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha’s perfume.	7.385651885937831
Having read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.	14.878639936484802
Weak joy opened his lips.	6.54240831593916
Changed since the first letter.	13.088791374728071
Wonder did she wrote it herself.	11.78415196969134
Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectable character.	9.927610184748517
Could meet one Sunday after the rosary.	9.949487450468776
Thank you: not having any.	11.862969452580082
Usual love scrimmage.	11.759602692500941
Then running round corners.	9.093426498511414
Bad as a row with Molly.	13.315104274086323
Cigar has a cooling effect.	9.97087076749956
Go further next time.	4.934134145854707
Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.	6.442669308214408
Brutal, why not?	9.961663359406254
Try it anyhow.	8.54385202866607
A bit at a time.	7.437613429567112
Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.	8.267602853978854
Common pin, eh?	7.853625269688766
He threw it on the road.	11.531629505411539
Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.	10.486582212003945
Queer the number of pins they always have.	8.355081850167405
No roses without thorns.	9.973370928595763
Those two sluts that night in the Coombe, linked together in the rain.	11.994571457788286
O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.	15.122265708244809
She didn’t know what to do To keep it up, To keep it up.	7.817442167891662
It?	32.172570290454246
Them.	32.172570290454246
Such a bad headache.	10.432222734477692
Has her roses probably.	6.4411752683792045
Or sitting all day typing.	12.69057305645821
Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves.	8.794410222306318
What perfume does your wife use.	8.50679099708448
Now could you make out a thing like that?	10.781151540951155
To keep it up.	5.196471248160874
Martha, Mary.	13.195929842047173
I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or faked for money.	7.743638266092015
He is sitting in their house, talking.	19.52941732049216
Mysterious.	32.172570290454246
Also the two sluts in the Coombe would listen.	18.71879404672577
To keep it up.	5.196471248160874
Nice kind of evening feeling.	12.617395808085778
No more wandering about.	8.47657083263469
Just loll there: quiet dusk: let everything rip.	7.6143718653954044
Forget.	32.172570290454246
Tell about places you have been, strange customs.	9.933545745138181
The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall at Ashtown.	10.774458307039568
Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches.	14.140687808806872
She listens with big dark soft eyes.	5.871415170423204
Tell her: more and more: all.	7.7353062094782645
Then a sigh: silence.	8.598857434928908
Long long long rest.	8.950451357564122
Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly in shreds and scattered them towards the road.	8.4523607529527
The shreds fluttered away, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.	12.733268613483668
Henry Flower.	12.321565674510317
You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.	14.96603363294051
Simple bit of paper.	9.993842414844243
Shows you the money to be made out of porter.	16.032656787365323
Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.	9.389224080766095
Skin breeds lice or vermin.	8.158550260309196
A million pounds, wait a moment.	6.5519488089186115
Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.	5.9536577569951366
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	6.821441875394431
Yes, exactly.	26.30570265781684
Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.	8.657692761287207
What am I saying barrels?	15.047846992883828
Gallons.	32.172570290454246
About a million barrels all the same.	7.8583939219040255
An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.	7.481561980817216
Barrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.	7.154869787101103
The bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.	9.02065814318184
He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows.	12.60852982830675
Stepping into the porch he doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind the leather headband.	12.735137019732537
Damn it.	4.086685952772903
I might have tried to work M’Coy for a pass to Mullingar.	14.483200713164967
Same notice on the door.	9.039560820303226
Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S.	8.293683751494648
on saint Peter Claver S.	4.5478359922346225
and the African Mission.	27.940994596693887
Prayers for the conversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious.	14.427077801481891
The protestants are the same.	8.224434367009817
Convert Dr William J.	5.328791546180473
Walsh D.D. to the true religion.	14.10430325675245
Save China’s millions.	17.708800270550363
Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee.	13.1751620105194
Prefer an ounce of opium.	8.959311931810982
Celestials.	32.172570290454246
Rank heresy for them.	4.501163188988188
Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum.	14.25086469782191
Taking it easy with hand under his cheek.	8.921778419537311
Josssticks burning.	12.6987856960012
Not like Ecce Homo.	11.042134167309898
Crown of thorns and cross.	6.608896098473096
Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock.	7.192036791584182
Chopsticks?	32.172570290454246
Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking.	13.07480974945756
Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t.	9.412379192084689
They’re taught that.	8.179555478356026
He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise blacks, is he?	12.167215651509313
The glasses would take their fancy, flashing.	8.937211115379387
Like to see them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening.	10.590500322385754
Still life.	5.6359903724278695
Lap it up like milk, I suppose.	11.86330002204702
The cold smell of sacred stone called him.	6.265892517443601
He trod the worn steps, pushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.	8.529154585279176
Something going on: some sodality.	12.641417778313327
Pity so empty.	10.400748342382293
Nice discreet place to be next some girl.	9.742846217458576
Who is my neighbour?	27.81133471326025
Jammed by the hour to slow music.	10.772365577424715
That woman at midnight mass.	10.046488982314493
Seventh heaven.	8.930941467908514
Women knelt in the benches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed.	8.654523953581526
A batch knelt at the altarrails.	14.002146186332396
The priest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands.	11.357778315509762
He stopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it neatly into her mouth.	8.852569367412796
Her hat and head sank.	12.929400767525816
Then the next one.	9.56383956982249
Her hat sank at once.	6.61486678525873
Then the next one: a small old woman.	13.958923465234228
The priest bent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time.	12.035253397376371
Latin.	20.267449269082853
The next one.	5.708141766333995
Shut your eyes and open your mouth.	7.873688069695792
_Corpus:_ body.	14.932965623390396
Corpse.	32.172570290454246
Good idea the Latin.	8.56276199829491
Stupefies them first.	6.286655741430517
They don’t seem to chew it: only swallow it down.	8.968905068411258
Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse.	12.184049455871465
Why the cannibals cotton to it.	4.178554541568472
He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, and seek their places.	9.630530297082185
He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner, nursing his hat and newspaper.	9.733401641349095
We ought to have hats modelled on our heads.	9.766994398279834
They were about him here and there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.	13.534997555784141
Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.	10.582032187967116
Look at them.	7.961114656205826
Lollipop.	32.172570290454246
It does.	9.054117655599306
Yes, bread of angels it’s called.	13.756255222452763
There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.	12.313288411214895
First communicants.	14.509135749322695
Hokypoky penny a lump.	9.65677074444687
Then feel all like one family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim.	13.377026487618481
They do.	6.7719948155639615
I’m sure of that.	7.526038574227998
In our confraternity.	11.764008436598358
Then come out a bit spreeish.	20.570148623419836
Thing is if you really believe in it.	6.783890638639994
Lourdes cure, waters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding.	8.039545289205465
Old fellow asleep near that confessionbox.	7.353379897729811
Hence those snores.	11.838425249631474
Blind faith.	8.373608532086674
Safe in the arms of kingdom come.	11.321074383229462
Lulls all pain.	8.581220298416754
Wake this time next year.	9.121633512582394
He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.	10.019637320695283
Suppose he lost the pin of his.	7.348719035647275
He wouldn’t know what to do to.	7.714402662014285
Bald spot behind.	6.989680545695608
Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I asked her.	16.493683410116983
I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is.	11.990151260097777
And the other one?	27.484827429065692
Iron nails ran in.	4.972987197547903
Meet one Sunday after the rosary.	10.140622462357282
Do not deny my request.	10.99515386238237
Turn up with a veil and black bag.	13.88761323948413
Dusk and the light behind her.	10.821964985838795
Their character.	8.160549961652364
That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the invincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion every morning.	11.969788377147786
This very church.	10.027038555161393
Peter Carey, yes.	5.816000270908596
No, Peter Claver I am thinking of.	14.215575787827687
Denis Carey.	15.045831905306336
And just imagine that.	6.034130925511491
Wife and six children at home.	7.931313556787365
And plotting that murder all the time.	5.1477169800362725
Those crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking about them.	9.719504557426582
They’re not straight men of business either.	10.10307390241728
O, no, she’s not here: the flower: no, no.	12.88918855800362
By the way, did I tear up that envelope?	15.03941105662173
Yes: under the bridge.	12.49693447043786
The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.	11.7538974626411
Wine.	25.535385961793953
Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic).	10.297410567325393
Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.	10.635285617558104
Cold comfort.	15.088141794024638
Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they’d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink.	7.7961933668445065
Queer the whole atmosphere of the.	8.67105322162946
Quite right.	6.068708734173107
Perfectly right that is.	4.948176319795976
Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir.	23.343129901728695
Pity.	22.307214335724723
Who has the organ here I wonder?	17.071085945723862
Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrument talk, the _vibrato_: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardiner street.	8.721168134843756
Molly was in fine voice that day, the _Stabat Mater_ of Rossini.	14.383851106336563
Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first.	10.683997764494482
Christ or Pilate?	13.90965459717029
Christ, but don’t keep us all night over it.	11.482973543794337
Music they wanted.	9.964393373140435
Footdrill stopped.	8.410956501700742
Could hear a pin drop.	10.555594430089782
I told her to pitch her voice against that corner.	9.10103293395308
I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the people looking up: _Quis est homo._ Some of that old sacred music splendid.	11.728580721704503
Mercadante: seven last words.	5.772038479178504
Mozart’s twelfth mass: _Gloria_ in that.	7.8052821358365705
Those old popes keen on music, on art and statues and pictures of all kinds.	8.861236470462304
Palestrina for example too.	6.522919410397061
They had a gay old time while it lasted.	12.577272058750806
Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brew liqueurs.	10.859554644286392
Benedictine.	32.172570290454246
Green Chartreuse.	14.509135749322695
Still, having eunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick.	21.025044519225162
What kind of voice is it?	9.978146681399574
Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.	14.465544776535307
Connoisseurs.	32.172570290454246
Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after.	8.617197616300173
Kind of a placid.	25.643720120566122
No worry.	12.200680240034972
Fall into flesh, don’t they?	8.65146536019524
Gluttons, tall, long legs.	8.065961416584846
Who knows?	14.706166233704028
Eunuch.	32.172570290454246
One way out of it.	5.511006748346927
He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and bless all the people.	11.480848509215242
All crossed themselves and stood up.	5.690612303761433
Stand up at the gospel of course.	11.386588851344612
Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly in his bench.	15.368917414215625
The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin.	11.976734861801965
Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a card: —O God, our refuge and our strength...	10.937104061352441
Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words.	13.744433422704763
English.	20.267449269082853
Throw them the bone.	10.964380607839555
I remember slightly.	15.695341325940271
How long since your last mass?	14.827801044310226
Glorious and immaculate virgin.	7.82564593534884
Joseph, her spouse.	16.284167729295827
Peter and Paul.	10.369353118469027
More interesting if you understood what it was all about.	11.834437377620494
Wonderful organisation certainly, goes like clockwork.	7.4085575629003255
Confession.	32.172570290454246
Everyone wants to.	5.515078949328455
Then I will tell you all.	9.134172260833031
Penance.	32.172570290454246
Punish me, please.	11.73370406389682
Great weapon in their hands.	8.849011818519509
More than doctor or solicitor.	8.979743919144198
Woman dying to.	5.564127005189068
And I schschschschschsch.	16.542445230716503
And did you chachachachacha?	17.775223688913385
And why did you?	9.6522354001078
Look down at her ring to find an excuse.	13.741075643406042
Whispering gallery walls have ears.	5.999484435755325
Husband learn to his surprise.	14.532860063905337
God’s little joke.	16.53308050586858
Then out she comes.	8.562987595253032
Repentance skindeep.	14.509135749322695
Lovely shame.	12.680683483171853
Hail Mary and Holy Mary.	9.371858920490562
Flowers, incense, candles melting.	8.049864352688578
Hide her blushes.	11.880530623276552
Salvation army blatant imitation.	9.830837876891714
Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.	6.924840888932672
How I found the Lord.	9.302617473657255
Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they work the whole show.	9.875768255723585
And don’t they rake in the money too?	15.182691421583094
Bequests also: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.	13.786484093020327
Masses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.	12.227464842163434
Monasteries and convents.	10.066878136379193
The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the witnessbox.	14.690334421140271
No browbeating him.	3.7270499533112638
He had his answer pat for everything.	10.38086695159911
Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church.	7.627037777777755
The doctors of the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.	9.0478604408152
The priest prayed: —Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict.	10.323294312732935
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.	11.700042660197129
The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off.	12.900752659891394
All over.	6.7082246848397125
The women remained behind: thanksgiving.	10.067788164349194
Better be shoving along.	9.103310757569712
Brother Buzz.	11.144207781784782
Come around with the plate perhaps.	11.24964910007241
Pay your Easter duty.	8.587805201374891
He stood up.	5.973677865295364
Hello.	16.81846716713923
Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?	12.407058033575938
Women enjoy it.	3.8675790697107524
Never tell you.	4.653391452705316
But we.	10.934779106309493
Excuse, miss, there’s a (whh!) just a (whh!) fluff.	8.675642079820777
Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.	8.62786475907691
Glimpses of the moon.	12.649963228232401
Annoyed if you don’t.	7.436457339008186
Why didn’t you tell me before.	11.38529218258275
Still like you better untidy.	12.249494801384177
Good job it wasn’t farther south.	11.98281473318809
He passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main door into the light.	10.305976457123588
He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water.	10.002249380731344
Trams: a car of Prescott’s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds.	16.20018450021955
Notice because I’m in mourning myself.	8.946681089560068
He covered himself.	5.90644469808266
Quarter past.	8.731095034027579
Time enough yet.	10.22950553155323
Better get that lotion made up.	7.898630087315107
Where is this?	17.23341761355424
Ah yes, the last time.	8.428841578316163
Sweny’s in Lincoln place.	8.905967552628857
Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.	8.69772887384896
Hamilton Long’s, founded in the year of the flood.	14.31230971969547
Huguenot churchyard near there.	4.839575478219244
Visit some day.	6.088076912535248
He walked southward along Westland row.	9.18900908275366
But the recipe is in the other trousers.	16.01583157678188
O, and I forgot that latchkey too.	9.57285042708416
Bore this funeral affair.	9.432624972337253
O well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault.	11.76737172758481
When was it I got it made up last?	16.53151157651361
I changed a sovereign I remember.	7.56579474318816
First of the month it must have been or the second.	14.02159092077015
O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.	16.351969482819523
The chemist turned back page after page.	7.304603643383425
Sandy shrivelled smell he seems to have.	6.1806687591620575
Shrunken skull.	9.957954844604965
And old.	8.732773735279585
Quest for the philosopher’s stone.	18.361204416640152
The alchemists.	14.509135749322695
Drugs age you after mental excitement.	9.09861383131991
Lethargy then.	6.314844812922283
Why?	12.512270304170855
Reaction.	32.172570290454246
A lifetime in a night.	8.487070923471427
Gradually changes your character.	6.606161534248124
Living all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants.	9.379313495198275

Te Virid.	14.509135749322695
Doctor Whack.	14.509135749322695
He ought to physic himself a bit.	10.597877384462967
Electuary or emulsion.	11.56275087870174
The first fellow that picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck.	11.84176228321523
Simples.	32.172570290454246
Want to be careful.	28.45085276628572

Remedy where you least expect it.	5.314894464869632
Clever of nature.	8.192856315685724
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	5.018818707065021
He waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the dusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs.	10.290244691645945
Lot of time taken up telling your aches and pains.	8.78067310505552
—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then orangeflower water...	5.251495554154903
It certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.	8.63560991972082
—And white wax also, he said.	5.852821071385047
Brings out the darkness of her eyes.	10.176896031910081
Looking at me, the sheet up to her eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my cuffs.	13.305558909653042
Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the teeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.	7.451632992181736
Skinfood.	32.172570290454246
One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it?	10.97065474378978
had only one skin.	11.781864783618651
Three we have.	6.905666827717035
Warts, bunions and pimples to make it worse.	7.927480856092373
But you want a perfume too.	6.802981148641084
What perfume does your?	11.059780750794483

That orangeflower water is so fresh.	12.778703676027227
Nice smell these soaps have.	6.029392028772193
Pure curd soap.	8.719847619164003
Time to get a bath round the corner.	11.223221942583615
Hammam.	32.172570290454246
Turkish.	25.535385961793953
Dirt gets rolled up in your navel.	14.32514760077361
Nicer if a nice girl did it.	6.97282987997027
Also I think I.	6.00250273968253
Yes I.	5.2102806014665335
Do it in the bath.	15.440402748636501
Curious longing I.	4.7559070933124215

Combine business with pleasure.	8.735707478381258

Feel fresh then all the day.	7.716092095558883
Funeral be rather glum.	8.831080146021145
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	6.889960022205581
That was two and nine.	11.951273439902085
Have you brought a bottle?	21.598057406703592
—No, Mr Bloom said.	5.2058252999005825
Make it up, please.	9.893323774169954
I’ll call later in the day and I’ll take one of these soaps.	16.20048855318975
How much are they?	12.770392039458356
—Fourpence, sir.	4.2050870715005475
Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.	15.331787359792543
Sweet lemony wax.	8.69561702225011
—I’ll take this one, he said.	7.00621759729953
That makes three and a penny.	11.860739999009406
—Yes, sir, the chemist said.	6.889960022205581
You can pay all together, sir, when you come back.	10.970168533410938
—Good, Mr Bloom said.	5.087896782892704
He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the coolwrappered soap in his left hand.	12.97532504066798
At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said: —Hello, Bloom.	8.619038340969905
What’s the best news?	18.60334016433067
Is that today’s?	15.203567708160094
Show us a minute.	12.924305394477987
Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip.	11.215578750520779
To look younger.	10.353910360257252
He does look balmy.	10.06794609493798
Younger than I am.	8.045220027208664
Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton.	10.536029633623428
Wants a wash too.	5.4161965700205865
Take off the rough dirt.	15.792563247006958
Good morning, have you used Pears’ soap?	11.761434721904115
Dandruff on his shoulders.	12.838876615688212
—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam Lyons said.	11.049345589138154
Where the bugger is it?	7.46085335535351
He rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.	7.5389269610246386
Barber’s itch.	30.206101169032973
Tight collar he’ll lose his hair.	10.173441437897889
Better leave him the paper and get shut of him.	8.015209817554666
—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.	8.424680898762348
—Ascot.	15.009292486789496
Gold cup.	9.076558963265722
Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered.	15.129020996540328
Half a mo.	12.7611482126389
Maximum the second.	8.91563900460348
—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.	9.511609881742636
Bantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.	12.367763235770548
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
his sharp voice said.	3.6199165604040546
—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered.	15.82022985206639
I was going to throw it away that moment.	13.085797098344766
Bantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread sheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.	9.063209469406338
—I’ll risk it, he said.	7.555655465048044
Here, thanks.	13.714994206755582
He sped off towards Conway’s corner.	8.323843795599153
God speed scut.	10.97871361386713
Mr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap in it, smiling.	11.185392584776862
Silly lips of that chap.	12.942009690192254
Betting.	32.172570290454246
Regular hotbed of it lately.	13.701143579721556
Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence.	9.717679043289573
Raffle for large tender turkey.	8.10363257545482
Your Christmas dinner for threepence.	8.730266523694874
Jack Fleming embezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America.	5.965671326980516
Keeps a hotel now.	4.698702481257332
They never come back.	7.100640293612817
Fleshpots of Egypt.	11.17983997206372
He walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths.	19.457897685346975
Remind you of a mosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets.	13.377094752414223
College sports today I see.	6.0457357465735
He eyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled up like a cod in a pot.	9.569127210614944
Damn bad ad.	9.025461587529819
Now if they had made it round like a wheel.	18.765695896721766
Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big: college.	8.046482634522379
Something to catch the eye.	7.061472979500521
There’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge.	22.031608795502912
Keep him on hands: might take a turn in there on the nod.	13.443504946111227
How do you do, Mr Hornblower?	19.662834330677267
How do you do, sir?	10.372129920165074
Heavenly weather really.	7.437568982715976
If life was always like that.	6.853103542560085
Cricket weather.	10.613172498221152
Sit around under sunshades.	8.894628876688671
Over after over.	6.190723948642354
They can’t play it here.	8.39948128773564
Duck for six wickets.	11.103009246739282
Still Captain Culler broke a window in the Kildare street club with a slog to square leg.	9.61151727296859
Donnybrook fair more in their line.	13.243542015561347
And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the floor.	11.976013791959938
Heatwave.	32.172570290454246
Won’t last.	14.303893603459645
Enjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid stream.	9.674520940779317
This is my body.	15.183639479417858
He foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved.	8.444930345297747
He saw his trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward, lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of thousands, a languid floating flower.	9.107612056536345
[ 6 ] Martin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself.	8.964541301794211
Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.	10.176071026779399
—Come on, Simon.	9.803599082763217
—After you, Mr Bloom said.	5.9085340207343515
Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying: —Yes, yes.	11.57100851059592
—Are we all here now?	13.592411547059067
Martin Cunningham asked.	8.401460688040919
Come along, Bloom.	5.9975549047525964
Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place.	16.139788564752706
He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight.	9.597286141587382
He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue.	14.30648578881304
One dragged aside: an old woman peeping.	12.99986915410294
Nose whiteflattened against the pane.	11.77637753379155
Thanking her stars she was passed over.	9.007778762769274
Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse.	11.901041963186577
Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming.	10.264323151197638
Job seems to suit them.	6.133135504403397
Huggermugger in corners.	8.463753813337625
Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d wake.	11.24289144538384
Then getting it ready.	8.294893552300039
Laying it out.	5.447245837434742
Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed.	9.835902078456936
Pull it more to your side.	10.48163475484151
Our windingsheet.	11.024559110298645
Never know who will touch you dead.	8.928665115792239
Wash and shampoo.	11.564019825102967
I believe they clip the nails and the hair.	8.858701537045855
Keep a bit in an envelope.	14.3926710646551
Grows all the same after.	11.5132730379125
Unclean job.	8.239292569051871
All waited.	10.03731883509593
Nothing was said.	3.558446205929832
Stowing in the wreaths probably.	13.992471709504352
Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket.	15.790129468021487
Better shift it out of that.	5.350259348455532
Wait for an opportunity.	17.964339815263536
All waited.	10.03731883509593
Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses’ hoofs.	8.665432621945856
A jolt.	14.833002552262101
Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.	8.44782052704493
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind.	5.880513221467711
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar.	8.645103079689925
At walking pace.	8.983115433003604
They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks.	12.77643965109341
Quicker.	32.172570290454246
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.	12.48016098397795
—What way is he taking us?	16.826905677042387
Mr Power asked through both windows.	10.593831527406616
—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said.	3.4547074819255092
Ringsend.	32.172570290454246
Brunswick street.	5.772132009681284
Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.	10.316702437203572
—That’s a fine old custom, he said.	6.2444798969331154
I am glad to see it has not died out.	12.638088029388113
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.	7.5321231716394
Respect.	32.172570290454246
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane.	11.331559185148695
Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.	10.802793966693624
—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.	7.6412454096975155
—Who is that?	9.906033142419492
—Your son and heir.	12.836850107498455
—Where is he?	9.971790703840202
Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.	11.852372716014063
The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels.	7.671510666305314
Mr Dedalus fell back, saying: —Was that Mulligan cad with him?	13.51433655185359
His _fidus Achates_! —No, Mr Bloom said.	6.1246923030805664
He was alone.	15.013697987979329
—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.	10.17501086787633
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road.	9.28505197555146
Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.	7.547977012956763
Richie Goulding and the legal bag.	15.087281304042316
Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.	7.965511211851643
His jokes are getting a bit damp.	10.922629872311282
Great card he was.	5.442926738299036
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady’s two hats pinned on his head.	10.110855155732523
Out on the rampage all night.	10.569214393446806
Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear.	11.344787547220102
Wife ironing his back.	5.038446289831748
Thinks he’ll cure it with pills.	15.781259110169126
All breadcrumbs they are.	5.917244099455636
About six hundred per cent profit.	10.948640331087246
—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled.	15.352719700231786
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts.	10.066610799876644
His name stinks all over Dublin.	10.448869719255754
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.	12.609275011255775
I’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.	7.115627511364145
He cried above the clatter of the wheels: —I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son.	10.853931732981863
A counterjumper’s son.	9.469905454599905
Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s.	8.011426893032274
Not likely.	10.537498549673511
He ceased.	11.392086880381463
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild face and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking.	15.585290673879285
Noisy selfwilled man.	5.134240739552822
He is right.	10.551197342348999
Something to hand on.	7.385370481469403
If little Rudy had lived.	8.777407973634784
See him grow up.	5.353868577782647
Hear his voice in the house.	8.903385682206723
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit.	9.385978305187852
Me in his eyes.	7.935346311506526
Strange feeling it would be.	7.400898944539076
From me.	4.5216291380000495
Just a chance.	14.333630466847397
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil.	15.083976228893125
And the sergeant grinning up.	8.057028866202534
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched.	13.414464440986158
Give us a touch, Poldy.	11.848437583483976
God, I’m dying for it.	7.960131460497968
How life begins.	10.355472836891146
Got big then.	5.89344895447357
Had to refuse the Greystones concert.	7.464596358185758
My son inside her.	4.899052138649502
I could have helped him on in life.	10.531082581782334
I could.	9.953547075490743
Make him independent.	14.207447677267734
Learn German too.	4.50772647789537
—Are we late?	19.75569608626983
Mr Power asked.	7.572804064344688
—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.	10.209584188706975
Molly.	14.933184300879459
Milly.	25.535385961793953
Same thing watered down.	5.870935238336771
Her tomboy oaths.	11.244563678125036
O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl.	7.551128309018141
Soon be a woman.	10.661778088663496
Dearest Papli.	12.965080807049691
Young student.	9.175398092422556
Yes, yes: a woman too.	13.057512471377413
Life, life.	6.549245948669422
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	11.946594011982512
—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.	7.289138359804574
—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him.	9.17736958356085
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.	13.038302144978623
—What is this, he said, in the name of God?	12.66731099362089
Crumbs?	32.172570290454246
—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.	8.048458758185895
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats.	8.21593454083796
Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said: —Unless I’m greatly mistaken.	12.322350170984675
What do you think, Martin?	15.423489914964776
—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.	7.033318610420392
Mr Bloom set his thigh down.	13.052680214741146
Glad I took that bath.	10.248416134022877
Feel my feet quite clean.	9.999799814268801
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.	8.599952509015376
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.	20.17489465901826
—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.	9.2725407015479
—Did Tom Kernan turn up?	13.787493162599105
Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.	11.442571994922139
—Yes, Mr Bloom answered.	10.426585303895191
He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.	12.113329873111194
—And Corny Kelleher himself?	19.951275506720794
Mr Power asked.	7.572804064344688
—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.	4.646841300046134
—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said.	9.429601547525973
The carriage halted short.	12.203150047356155
—What’s wrong?	22.04247712239294
—We’re stopped.	13.190258973430975
—Where are we?	17.030802364159467
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.	15.443343170097533
—The grand canal, he said.	6.064477288436283
Gasworks.	32.172570290454246
Whooping cough they say it cures.	10.950426846128705
Good job Milly never got it.	5.238887918347111
Shame really.	8.440345427190756
Got off lightly with illnesses compared.	8.37250716466465
Only measles.	14.509135749322695
Flaxseed tea.	8.474731442099447
Scarlatina, influenza epidemics.	9.335256534228037
Canvassing for death.	6.61568827541679
Don’t miss this chance.	12.405004955707481
Dogs’ home over there.	5.984768212079145
Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish.	9.766158271188624
Thy will be done.	10.898218918918934
We obey them in the grave.	11.33460728993483
A dying scrawl.	11.72556612636925
He took it to heart, pined away.	10.456341012919324
Quiet brute.	12.651986113682064
Old men’s dogs usually are.	10.201579828644132
A raindrop spat on his hat.	7.346434021814934
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags.	12.54087185665141
Apart.	32.172570290454246
Like through a colander.	15.174127248301875
I thought it would.	10.968629256111148
My boots were creaking I remember now.	5.904284283363547
—The weather is changing, he said quietly.	12.701297861811309
—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.	7.802423106716172
—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said.	7.522114280534031
There’s the sun again coming out.	9.904540389642065
Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.	11.550561083846944
—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.	8.941338253831264
—We’re off again.	8.281591112547996
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.	7.747900575947429
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.	10.921903218631536
—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said.	5.007111266504239
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.	9.544335965428463
—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly.	13.388209687262439
Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of _The Croppy Boy_.	14.734117520357003
—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously.	10.058534407476364
_His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience._ —Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing.	13.135053249818586
He’s dead nuts on that.	8.706507869184655
And the retrospective arrangement.	16.9145615861756
—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech?	18.285990773284176
Martin Cunningham asked.	8.401460688040919
—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said.	9.927484137332195
Where is it?	8.536026887684905
—In the paper this morning.	11.05203312983751
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket.	16.16127377555874
That book I must change for her.	6.927610814600649
—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly.	11.164371041818924
Later on please.	8.259610212090523
Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that?	7.04029922954885
no, Sexton, Urbright.	12.222365121927261
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.	8.36218310361548
Thanks to the Little Flower.	16.078895828246655
Sadly missed.	15.088141794024638
To the inexpressible grief of his.	7.961225177135231
Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness.	11.62771361305949
Month’s mind: Quinlan.	15.719477185886882
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.	8.014071991909384
It is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.	9.265307574021904
I tore up the envelope?	18.00811101459622
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath?	16.785242875169665
He patted his waistcoatpocket.	9.626520996423128
Dear Henry fled.	15.854643302232558
Before my patience are exhausted.	8.803698322935235
National school.	9.234992897524911
Meade’s yard.	18.8051869223004
The hazard.	12.378863073457003
Only two there now.	4.74364800428349
Nodding.	32.172570290454246
Full as a tick.	20.27796306140499
Too much bone in their skulls.	16.277637981915703
The other trotting round with a fare.	16.947412147928834
An hour ago I was passing there.	8.891147325048284
The jarvies raised their hats.	8.628402688095786
Couldn’t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier?	11.435522488973128
Well but that fellow would lose his job then?	10.656748195229786
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?	14.97397009753142
Antient concert rooms.	9.459086427357555
Nothing on there.	4.890533999847302
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet.	17.575973751418253
Not much grief there.	5.777636753297952
Quarter mourning.	9.590083934049536
People in law perhaps.	5.984959062142697
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence.	10.3074348184556
Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer.	7.836919598735245
Could I go to see _Leah_ tonight, I wonder.	14.840912702715626
I said I.	6.274400012234965
Or the _Lily of Killarney_?	12.517478429285942
Elster Grimes Opera Company.	10.306876550872484
Big powerful change.	7.962270844171868
Wet bright bills for next week.	7.0355327009068995
_Fun on the Bristol_.	24.84240201137957
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety.	16.226127233243663
Have to stand a drink or two.	8.645534871642765
He’s coming in the afternoon.	22.721612279034673
Her songs.	12.621260247635798
Plasto’s.	4.980475362778415
Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust.	12.093223882752856
Who was he?	12.15790430291158
—How do you do?	12.283682004634262
Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.	13.02688394036919
—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said.	9.85127865041151
Yes, he does.	17.681985365824282
How do you do?	11.57332665035171
—Who?	11.362660442813608
—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said.	5.776994090879678
There he is airing his quiff.	14.434401118632827
Just that moment I was thinking.	11.825545675762921
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute.	14.035575695015288
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.	10.92601814142815
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand.	13.625859858323162
The nails, yes.	5.872837975721158
Is there anything more in him that they she sees?	14.39560001548691
Fascination.	32.172570290454246
Worst man in Dublin.	9.323463955599069
That keeps him alive.	7.100911732592019
They sometimes feel what a person is.	7.019811872265123
Instinct.	25.535385961793953
But a type like that.	5.992229366273869
My nails.	11.42439294706638
I am just looking at them: well pared.	15.856597112584074
And after: thinking alone.	7.148759782477201
Body getting a bit softy.	15.862698433552866
I would notice that: from remembering.	14.8800485537627
What causes that?	6.21737827489891
I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off.	10.594207582885389
But the shape is there.	9.139001232458853
The shape is there still.	8.680379960795271
Shoulders.	32.172570290454246
Hips.	32.172570290454246
Plump.	32.172570290454246
Night of the dance dressing.	17.67192784830676
Mr Power asked: —How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?	15.566075113216858
—O, very well, Mr Bloom said.	8.104617073968436
I hear great accounts of it.	5.813280754037173
It’s a good idea, you see...	6.516518294381624
—Are you going yourself?	12.867500816001861
—Well no, Mr Bloom said.	6.59328384570036
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business.	13.218478030698835
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.	12.80808408821504
What you lose on one you can make up on the other.	11.467892764419998
Mary Anderson is up there now.	6.78179122780014
Have you good artists?	23.35616697805688
—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said.	4.730460539195378
O yes, we’ll have all topnobbers.	14.59295280987329
C.	8.56499542248637
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and.	7.883622596879699
The best, in fact.	10.602612359110582
—And _Madame_, Mr Power said smiling.	14.020489852827541
Last but not least.	10.449135238108418
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.	10.05175869200923
Smith O’Brien.	14.986461240581889
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there.	5.634926887305975
Woman.	20.267449269082853
For many happy returns.	7.670193066514107
The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.	8.826875353871317
Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.	14.279302476747013
—Four bootlaces for a penny.	10.185182927244629
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls.	20.083877779837284
Had his office in Hume street.	4.946722394463828
Same house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.	9.827637366143133
Has that silk hat ever since.	11.052687438983593
Relics of old decency.	16.07911395942865
Mourning too.	4.66219583534958
Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.	8.455944024888103
O’Callaghan on his last legs.	20.04207602977852
And _Madame_.	15.618527184337362
Twenty past eleven.	7.630522300173701
Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean.	9.2097411801974
Doing her hair, humming: _voglio e non vorrei_.	7.487492771464199
No: _vorrei e non_.	9.731079577802332
Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split.	19.922886255200407
_Mi trema un poco il_.	8.433856947950366
Beautiful on that _tre_ her voice is: weeping tone.	10.223426861628289
A thrush.	11.024559110298645
A throstle.	12.378863073457003
There is a word throstle that expresses that.	8.87659337172384
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face.	9.932622733106854
Greyish over the ears.	10.95104522053475
_Madame_: smiling.	7.64736083821208
I smiled back.	6.4745169236346705
A smile goes a long way.	8.582197082590126
Only politeness perhaps.	6.139144325483407
Nice fellow.	8.12757792990543
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps?	16.795292887830602
Not pleasant for the wife.	9.487936564727432
Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal.	16.677108912874935
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick.	9.90287445038036
Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak.	14.022862105667295
What is this she was?	16.964151082483575
Barmaid in Jury’s.	4.4318371140375366
Or the Moira, was it?	8.82073685073852
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.	11.866007097301136
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.	12.225104242760896
—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.	5.255681769102603
A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.	11.282206839028907
—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.	7.930450089590983
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly: —The devil break the hasp of your back! Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray’s statue.	12.802943553959937
—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.	15.569551925325865
His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes.	10.067992030942793
He caressed his beard, adding: —Well, nearly all of us.	8.556675740576766
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.	12.787731173159342
—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.	10.17054993578523
—About the boatman?	12.866853775604095
Mr Power asked.	7.572804064344688
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Isn’t it awfully good?	12.28705258424625
—What is that?	9.740616712481513
I didn’t hear it.	6.666291853506998
—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both.....	10.668241662864048
—What?	12.016783147492532
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?	5.160406312428841
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	5.018818707065021
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown.....	8.871318114780756
—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried.	7.521526818835324
I wish to Christ he did! Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.	11.670535735584156
—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....	5.495369101354073
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely: —Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.	12.878083785118903
—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright.	17.080009348159507
Is he dead?	16.63761088558868
—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried.	8.861769454975255
Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive.	13.469320135804143
Half the town was there.	6.562708834515953
—Yes, Mr Bloom said.	5.018818707065021
—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son’s life.	8.156336363160852
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.	8.524563133133437
—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed.	13.917742941308916
Like a hero.	14.891039851880087
A silver florin.	10.27632540410285
—Isn’t it awfully good?	10.22338634351796
Mr Bloom said eagerly.	17.28213790976535
Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.	14.57899420778424
Nelson’s pillar.	18.958695844812425
—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny! —We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.	8.639549621806047
Mr Dedalus sighed.	21.794208997713294
—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.	12.926812696180301
Many a good one he told himself.	10.816792851454457
Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this.	12.83376966310645
He’s gone from us.	11.987087392314123
—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said.	8.841703136977046
He went very suddenly.	11.790904474674134
—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said.	3.4259421514410686
Heart.	25.535385961793953
He tapped his chest sadly.	12.644210449757113
Blazing face: redhot.	12.322863931032561
Too much John Barleycorn.	13.705277565173192
Cure for a red nose.	13.921194503770316
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite.	14.189916418630341
A lot of money he spent colouring it.	5.748765708266352
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.	12.763738854469894
—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.	9.640163526348637
—The best death, Mr Bloom said.	8.553094984539852
Their wide open eyes looked at him.	5.642824751764322
—No suffering, he said.	5.623063681389527
A moment and all is over.	10.235867784425352
Like dying in sleep.	8.117878211074276
No-one spoke.	12.979146585460965
Dead side of the street this.	10.924482940040134
Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind.	7.8325238030483595
Why?	12.512270304170855
Some reason.	10.68404504393199
Sun or wind.	7.362467912743693
At night too.	4.791899169194887
Chummies and slaveys.	11.564019825102967
Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew.	15.272505907072418
Foundation stone for Parnell.	8.801797605140159
Breakdown.	32.172570290454246
Heart.	25.535385961793953
White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping.	9.143835545733987
A tiny coffin flashed by.	6.404326958987853
In a hurry to bury.	16.30427485892205
A mourning coach.	10.278297927832691
Unmarried.	32.172570290454246
Piebald for bachelors.	12.310962901432042
Dun for a nun.	22.67223744748932
—Sad, Martin Cunningham said.	3.603425725449518
A child.	9.40424697786981
A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was.	7.752855509167568
Dwarf’s body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box.	10.47750952583843
Burial friendly society pays.	8.887371821773504
Penny a week for a sod of turf.	11.2216800947727
Our.	25.535385961793953
Little.	32.172570290454246
Beggar.	32.172570290454246
Meant nothing.	7.29472071468589
Mistake of nature.	8.192856315685724
If it’s healthy it’s from the mother.	13.750587981019276
If not from the man.	8.571860559289693
Better luck next time.	4.961138339984109
—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said.	6.095581825064544
It’s well out of it.	8.207188247641001
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square.	7.592295836690219
Rattle his bones.	7.806085033353697
Only a pauper.	13.565104871656962
Nobody owns.	12.531268249602594
—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.	6.379497025574908
—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.	11.686145188536052
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.	8.505987692266057
—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.	14.847327629896615
—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively.	9.88807336143609
We must take a charitable view of it.	6.717416692238754
—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.	11.000866704951896
—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.	7.5998996608538665
Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again.	11.744197605441332
Martin Cunningham’s large eyes.	9.892975948222665
Looking away now.	4.889705319478445
Sympathetic human man he is.	5.728307603202628
Intelligent.	32.172570290454246
Like Shakespeare’s face.	7.747663015190014
Always a good word to say.	9.175189142402743
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide.	14.284868255924556
Refuse christian burial.	11.806030102397717
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave.	11.18707466947606
As if it wasn’t broken already.	14.82314846211621
Yet sometimes they repent too late.	7.379135953041638
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes.	14.669929386945611
He looked at me.	6.960779860732135
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his.	10.90728776629831
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost.	11.044641737767135
Leading him the life of the damned.	17.018898360193756
Wear the heart out of a stone, that.	9.117683923177294
Monday morning.	6.885413567604797
Start afresh.	14.509135749322695
Shoulder to the wheel.	18.788680553995274
Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there.	11.810363220760497
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin’s umbrella.	11.711169712015716
And they call me the jewel of Asia, Of Asia, The geisha.	9.994865444418153
He looked away from me.	9.285416038021898
He knows.	11.732347563967275
Rattle his bones.	7.806085033353697
That afternoon of the inquest.	20.884150765629403
The redlabelled bottle on the table.	7.500734196511837
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures.	10.85874638011415
Stuffy it was.	5.886595475000643
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind.	15.063826190361961
The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy.	12.28474984678318
Boots giving evidence.	10.358104235409321
Thought he was asleep first.	12.376667571816819
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.	9.933406368436053
Verdict: overdose.	11.769504947778186
Death by misadventure.	10.183292615460505
The letter.	9.125285408638051
For my son Leopold.	10.810579757744941
No more pain.	12.940289497400899
Wake no more.	6.439680492124168
Nobody owns.	12.531268249602594
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street.	5.913073087322941
—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.	7.126130907095668
—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.	9.766273221387582
—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said.	7.9102262156401535
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany.	12.148008983918126
The Gordon Bennett.	8.705938892215961
That will be worth seeing, faith.	9.219633664533575
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls.	11.673028307080799
Has anybody here seen Kelly?	11.169060809187593
Kay ee double ell wy.	8.931066397094469
Dead March from _Saul._ He’s as bad as old Antonio.	9.270401249158741
He left me on my ownio.	15.330649009518368
Pirouette! The _Mater Misericordiae_.	13.98356795454569
Eccles street.	5.650252478558847
My house down there.	5.021395780683418
Big place.	7.03997506552071
Ward for incurables there.	4.505068494950912
Very encouraging.	15.009292486789496
Our Lady’s Hospice for the dying.	20.076127629835494
Deadhouse handy underneath.	11.618201155195111
Where old Mrs Riordan died.	10.145034876889381
They look terrible the women.	6.150253491978763
Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon.	11.289407353605672
Then the screen round her bed for her to die.	12.872802506815779
Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me.	7.800397099914096
He’s gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me.	10.859106874654907
From one extreme to the other.	7.939425315370554
The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.	9.519613040037644
—What’s wrong now?	14.013867684802193
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups.	6.391989377678054
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.	7.271737247975079
—Emigrants, Mr Power said.	4.567319039061776
—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.	12.828559485547924
Huuuh! out of that! Thursday, of course.	8.549012788459699
Tomorrow is killing day.	5.417204061496923
Springers.	32.172570290454246
Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each.	7.338043322972954
For Liverpool probably.	6.814763650974155
Roastbeef for old England.	10.925757323652281
They buy up all the juicy ones.	11.927039901864868
And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns.	9.148712863738023
Comes to a big thing in a year.	18.521874706870793
Dead meat trade.	8.518579568890646
Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine.	10.824410831573918
Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.	8.944467422718294
The carriage moved on through the drove.	14.532768978007509
—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said.	11.304344879635767
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.	13.285201417781032
—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said.	4.890673608895219
Quite right.	6.068708734173107
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know.	10.069586931425345
Don’t you see what I mean?	16.436362296547255
—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said.	9.483257682503773
Pullman car and saloon diningroom.	11.049544706512851
—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.	11.539759655146039
—Why?	11.984639852917844
Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus.	13.880531112761814
Wouldn’t it be more decent than galloping two abreast?	11.820817050627106
—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.	15.956905106467305
—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.	9.737226499199855
—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road.	13.801443637913577
Terrible! —First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	11.007773577247763
Gordon Bennett cup.	9.75705638195014
—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.	11.682810493589624
Bom! Upset.	11.56333526330851
A coffin bumped out on to the road.	9.151368296855022
Burst open.	7.796576974338742
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	10.279542330149795
Red face: grey now.	5.540195156700957
Mouth fallen open.	6.970457851020583
Asking what’s up now.	7.358764039331373
Quite right to close it.	7.220497046646499
Then the insides decompose quickly.	9.502398346620176
Much better to close up all the orifices.	15.158579993864135
Yes, also.	20.64646871422729
With wax.	11.415234580004299
The sphincter loose.	8.741639444359237
Seal up all.	5.704340626056053
—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.	10.189393586706325
Dunphy’s corner.	12.873585163954305
Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief.	8.894325141456886
A pause by the wayside.	17.05351087172532
Tiptop position for a pub.	14.516503598311232
Expect we’ll pull up here on the way back to drink his health.	14.76348981781118
Pass round the consolation.	16.790670226155584
Elixir of life.	5.646671179269495
But suppose now it did happen.	11.15694136581235
Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about?	10.36168130121589
He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose.	10.849603707723258
Depends on where.	10.975529778003741
The circulation stops.	10.182040067981696
Still some might ooze out of an artery.	12.601747578091938
It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.	15.97757243239263
In silence they drove along Phibsborough road.	6.225246355409261
An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.	9.925793036421817
Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.	15.065569994174801
Water rushed roaring through the sluices.	12.740771281905788
A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf.	10.119730979348866
On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.	11.608451926317176
Aboard of the _Bugabu._ Their eyes watched him.	8.884897371971434
On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs.	8.139602510850034
Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal.	12.743057721502455
Or cycle down.	5.663577620188617
Hire some old crock, safety.	9.052786139078762
Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady’s.	9.785153818506744
Developing waterways.	14.833002552262101
James M’Cann’s hobby to row me o’er the ferry.	11.955799417999495
Cheaper transit.	15.009292486789496
By easy stages.	11.515882569716574
Houseboats.	32.172570290454246
Camping out.	5.290343465284296
Also hearses.	12.200680240034972
To heaven by water.	6.80514942737173
Perhaps I will without writing.	12.014436917988641
Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla.	9.292140794981092
Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin.	5.48670538591762
With turf from the midland bogs.	13.948675639080436
Salute.	32.172570290454246
He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.	8.536713467793517
They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house.	5.851395596012059
Near it now.	4.9106707759980495
—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.	10.45180436580819
—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.	5.587215450186385
—How is that?	9.210157708641255
Martin Cunningham said.	3.677401538730519
Left him weeping, I suppose?	11.731645027322536
—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.	8.408736289032545
The carriage steered left for Finglas road.	6.9825738019872885
The stonecutter’s yard on the right.	11.326271707333786
Last lap.	10.37411064089626
Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing.	8.047244483315993
Fragments of shapes, hewn.	8.126815888019028
In white silence: appealing.	9.21908328493517
Thos.	32.172570290454246
H.	11.481841078558022
Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.	7.250494271502086
Passed.	32.172570290454246
On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot.	9.72583971254908
After life’s journey.	21.78183016005875
Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.	8.317507455774377
Mr Power pointed.	23.813044222649655
The last house.	8.456792596424634
—So it is, Mr Dedalus said.	5.99967095698266
A gruesome case.	7.4164750859853035
Seymour Bushe got him off.	8.681005440029098
Murdered his brother.	7.863070464908707
Or so they said.	4.778079336521123
—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.	8.7218042681471
—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added.	7.973250943684447
That’s the maxim of the law.	12.857616731092499
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.	9.687082283199533
They looked.	10.141495411940356
Murderer’s ground.	15.776099195299944
It passed darkly.	13.569629899767198
Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden.	5.06710354938843
Whole place gone to hell.	9.593943347451914
Wrongfully condemned.	11.144207781784782
Murder.	32.172570290454246
The murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered.	21.05371723679848
Man’s head found in a garden.	16.71170599135246
Her clothing consisted of.	5.506976614210617
How she met her death.	6.712868690934922
Recent outrage.	15.045831905306336
The weapon used.	11.80868339129157
Murderer is still at large.	11.254249503245873
Clues.	32.172570290454246
A shoelace.	14.509135749322695
The body to be exhumed.	22.111701959270828
Cramped in this carriage.	14.12302446981237
Must be careful about women.	12.559171994196353
Catch them once with their pants down.	8.427454605109826
Never forgive you after.	7.060751058208205
Fifteen.	22.307214335724723
The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze.	6.4583605811244125
Dark poplars, rare white forms.	5.981567845445057
Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.	6.636819288282207
The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped.	7.795139254980784
Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee.	11.830971113134435
He stepped out.	5.823413864778192
Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.	18.366240361478305
Change that soap now.	5.212942341922687
Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.	8.459272986377176
He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.	10.285933333947685
Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages.	7.958074585321155
It’s all the same.	10.030799571110137
Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley.	6.8710397418882465
Pomp of death.	6.687671213189715
Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit.	6.6130706378467385
Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.	7.9823564556872
Dogbiscuits.	32.172570290454246
Who ate them?	10.051959892035793
Mourners coming out.	5.364006728614571
He followed his companions.	13.053749590609465
Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them.	7.746007085353071
Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths.	14.951111313368795
He handed one to the boy.	10.847467058761778
Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?	17.617143355974523
A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.	6.850401086292234
The waggoner marching at their head saluted.	8.691268059991904
Coffin now.	4.779330306107821
Got here before us, dead as he is.	8.422608550952315
Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways.	13.823083719970462
Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something.	9.433658902235067
Do they know what they cart out here every day?	15.730890575975236
Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day.	6.570991707349079
Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.	16.47081164208093
Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute.	11.800742209377718
Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick.	13.247176812473946
Thousands every hour.	9.592586230539064
Too many in the world.	8.16503440189222
Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl.	11.360628394815803
Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry.	10.732543333909964
Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.	13.560529644237196
Fish’s face, bloodless and livid.	12.093494100165831
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates.	9.520799937408794
So much dead weight.	9.248125040552683
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath.	10.414788708430214
First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff.	13.367466820436382
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths.	15.841541907026086
Who is that beside them?	15.88368602581541
Ah, the brother-in-law.	10.611535571016669
All walked after.	6.66385274988874
Martin Cunningham whispered: —I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.	10.252972243782708
—What?	12.016783147492532
Mr Power whispered.	14.386774556295867
How so?	9.615561181337451
—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered.	10.51909066966638
Had the Queen’s hotel in Ennis.	12.940887463813858
You heard him say he was going to Clare.	15.275998899609437
Anniversary.	32.172570290454246
—O God! Mr Power whispered.	18.73508976541319
First I heard of it.	6.280029635608982
Poisoned himself?	12.663016484712502
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal’s mausoleum.	15.200833045894202
Speaking.	32.172570290454246
—Was he insured?	17.638636959670457
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered.	18.85613440536454
But the policy was heavily mortgaged.	12.455176986081657
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.	10.239210273893596
—How many children did he leave?	20.461170686302182
—Five.	15.145493576102345
Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.	12.117180019580362
—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently.	12.7335456500388
Five young children.	9.049579648807583
—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.	18.061731677933228
—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.	13.442110531365705
Has the laugh at him now.	9.044569562761298
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished.	16.463760193872382
She had outlived him.	6.255246893370198
Lost her husband.	9.737832750909151
More dead for her than for me.	7.560679424158406
One must outlive the other.	6.210810855772597
Wise men say.	5.641458414085827
There are more women than men in the world.	8.37703516531136
Condole with her.	5.090636470821538
Your terrible loss.	9.42273460430007
I hope you’ll soon follow him.	8.911046266012981
For Hindu widows only.	7.064252720058876
She would marry another.	9.445169800700457
Him?	25.535385961793953
No. Yet who knows after.	11.303245311130954
Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died.	15.247367612980907
Drawn on a guncarriage.	19.837538035824583
Victoria and Albert.	11.938650614783631
Frogmore memorial mourning.	7.880840926845597
But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet.	19.3026633918192
Vain in her heart of hearts.	14.615859827587938
All for a shadow.	16.225212453031805
Consort not even a king.	9.912221994693676
Her son was the substance.	16.328203259088692
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting.	11.426704331557334
It never comes.	9.718708746320853
One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.	13.528840214095919
—How are you, Simon?	19.947828864796143
Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands.	8.886551033684153
Haven’t seen you for a month of Sundays.	16.626438200869273
—Never better.	7.819684281358391
How are all in Cork’s own town?	18.639664864204867
—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said.	8.24243372582346
Same old six and eightpence.	10.779432022462025
Stopped with Dick Tivy.	10.183205233037702
—And how is Dick, the solid man?	16.378696450755847
—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.	8.667951200389094
—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder.	11.00857540755045
Dick Tivy bald?	14.91041086848275
—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead.	13.155245296188099
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.	7.42533178474756
—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously.	14.144530763113377
Is that the eldest boy in front?	19.26129695423274
—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother.	13.074179865142217
John Henry Menton is behind.	7.82782519985729
He put down his name for a quid.	19.013894584605676
—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said.	7.953099442341963
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job.	8.973098763729928
John Henry is not the worst in the world.	10.077369628079891
—How did he lose it?	12.187141417266494
Liquor, what?	9.89836476792934
—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.	13.990945389310518
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel.	17.05335502180186
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar.	13.154200512610657
Poor boy! Was he there when the father?	13.699005364958218
Both unconscious.	12.378863073457003
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time.	10.565837633643829
All he might have done.	11.880976543373311
I owe three shillings to O’Grady.	14.81050253582956
Would he understand?	14.243503503191633
Which end is his head?	15.08720777087619
After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light.	12.733228697002067
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners.	9.102334561064316
Always in front of us.	7.726208815537066
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks.	11.339099016524465
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it.	8.46939643816095
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.	10.597944825968618
The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly.	12.080521513489748
Who’ll read the book?	26.71274487181057
I, said the rook.	13.069525993724033
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.	19.356453502159813
Father Coffey.	15.618527184337362
I knew his name was like a coffin.	15.481444587299638
_Dominenamine._ Bully about the muzzle he looks.	10.304139414500316
Bosses the show.	7.2829592070987355
Muscular christian.	15.141877057334794
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest.	7.599971027021307
Thou art Peter.	12.854234958415269
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will.	10.257280374713025
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.	17.25953802804985
Most amusing expressions that man finds.	10.566111976639679
Hhhn: burst sideways.	8.449654603101825
_—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine._ Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin.	8.418056080403804
Requiem mass.	10.065540000170595
Crape weepers.	14.833002552262101
Your name on the altarlist.	21.579957220800463
Chilly place this.	6.914338597572539
Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please.	16.34404220054386
Eyes of a toad too.	9.775273196871904
What swells him up that way?	12.172426532692384
Molly gets swelled after cabbage.	7.847704571327521
Air of the place maybe.	20.836260276677134
Looks full up of bad gas.	9.567517732393682
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place.	11.489104546350157
Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks.	13.255234826349781
Who was telling me?	10.118238790419724
Mervyn Browne.	14.833002552262101
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it.	10.742707101533485
Out it rushes: blue.	7.534999937281475
One whiff of that and you’re a goner.	10.821422098027496
My kneecap is hurting me.	3.841387067224406
Ow. That’s better.	11.22657866683091
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucket and shook it over the coffin.	15.323859540834832
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again.	12.017039871325935
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket.	16.95209782663047
As you were before you rested.	16.00277526483067
It’s all written down: he has to do it.	9.702390476575127
_—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem._ The server piped the answers in the treble.	9.472872310309558
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants.	15.512371271561014
Up to fifteen or so.	7.950035198878498
After that, of course ...	3.5833400535346187
Holy water that was, I expect.	12.225946073670091
Shaking sleep out of it.	4.701838810431034
He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.	10.184841404391419
Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts.	6.53034714111082
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep.	12.970641420229757
On Dignam now.	4.717610819991063
Says that over everybody.	9.027268727680909
Tiresome kind of a job.	12.06497957682642
But he has to say something.	17.580465878998854
The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server.	15.847773532955905
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart.	13.138684751730686
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law.	10.494650703431967
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air.	11.546995829943647
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left.	11.885381952450027
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.	8.744565527741496
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo.	5.86543419558368
Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.	14.68056942755207
—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.	10.834381120335204
Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.	17.656781467896508
—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’.	11.462609086399732
But his heart is buried in Rome.	10.007958382875199
Let Him take me whenever He likes.	9.883557519734985
Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk.	12.003454476022691
Mr Power took his arm.	14.082900586810638
—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.	13.746521800097808
—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp.	18.22651843474354
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.	15.908690911310035
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.	8.096238748254914
—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.	12.247548935721277
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.	10.82016996192453
—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said.	10.495863093226196
I suppose we can do so too.	11.193232226344865
This cemetery is a treacherous place.	8.61461155233566
They covered their heads.	8.021219149135364
—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?	13.59720993514691
Mr Kernan said with reproof.	16.517774690719513
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes.	11.91097613553894
Secret eyes, secretsearching.	15.60815239349812
Mason, I think: not sure.	11.214666728619846
Beside him again.	5.943063581223544
In the same boat.	28.84672972495946
Hope he’ll say something else.	12.17698073139485
Mr Kernan added: —The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.	9.822716841078941
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent.	16.697720860922946
The language of course was another thing.	9.376646165392021
Mr Kernan said with solemnity: —_I am the resurrection and the life_.	16.818116354140646
That touches a man’s inmost heart.	10.537096253675015
—It does, Mr Bloom said.	6.71690830326226
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies?	13.600611191146184
No touching that.	4.484528595254492
Seat of the affections.	24.473745027231566
Broken heart.	7.213280191685069
A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day.	6.793360437489195
One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are.	7.74049626788254
Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers.	8.124962714570705
Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else.	6.652799003773246
The resurrection and the life.	7.6465243912465946
Once you are dead you are dead.	11.267823198724608
That last day idea.	9.394658974736034
Knocking them all up out of their graves.	13.953872205316985
Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.	9.471071170686388
Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps.	13.10962078461403
Find damn all of himself that morning.	8.061619292186007
Pennyweight of powder in a skull.	12.109885461384154
Twelve grammes one pennyweight.	9.143100332920282
Troy measure.	15.132854612772425
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.	10.309991123848734
—Everything went off A1, he said.	4.166644475958123
He looked on them from his drawling eye.	12.323930877841438
Policeman’s shoulders.	15.158402353335982
With your tooraloom tooraloom.	8.066507871095862
—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.	8.283458390001368
—What?	12.016783147492532
Corny Kelleher said.	4.544926862378164
Mr Kernan assured him.	6.302721963424902
—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan?	18.81872095067238
John Henry Menton asked.	7.49435612422165
I know his face.	7.171739521643282
Ned Lambert glanced back.	9.096215732857855
—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.	12.377723840683894
She’s his wife.	9.621714222859664
—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said.	8.413539593051503
I haven’t seen her for some time.	10.341190282749192
She was a finelooking woman.	12.363279644934924
I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown.	9.278744239353886
And a good armful she was.	11.01266320756496
He looked behind through the others.	13.733081663295339
—What is he?	11.528336174648732
he asked.	5.571194519539272
What does he do?	10.951273792636167
Wasn’t he in the stationery line?	16.375693739738686
I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.	14.796045858653265
Ned Lambert smiled.	15.298810948080643
—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s.	7.3850145813578445
A traveller for blottingpaper.	9.70280451832727
—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for?	12.835300135021429
She had plenty of game in her then.	9.564534183742799
—Has still, Ned Lambert said.	5.313006235038389
John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.	11.388886636356377
The barrow turned into a side lane.	10.65460017160894
A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage.	9.954303581913576
The gravediggers touched their caps.	10.699766549326904
—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased.	11.530133256116589
He never forgets a friend.	7.0621335978897894
Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence.	11.804952756042788
Mr Dedalus said: —I am come to pay you another visit.	15.908674850890055
—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice.	13.995824013953687
I don’t want your custom at all.	7.939434900357772
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.	9.009086290844571
—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?	19.136926853452806
—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.	7.397860274060229
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear.	5.4361207661786235
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.	12.060751480562859
—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs.	12.177736431815612
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried.	13.533954639857662
One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy.	15.990550841303373
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.	7.78300054246381
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed.	12.958279825354905
He resumed: —And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, _Not a bloody bit like the man_, says he.	9.534974633058713
_That’s not Mulcahy_, says he, _whoever done it_.	11.3158237631697
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.	9.350475148534551
—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.	13.717466890747465
—I know, Hynes said.	7.453390376135771
—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said.	6.59949558448319
It’s pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.	9.721431474741356
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk.	17.471027826075215
All want to be on good terms with him.	6.959233224524857
Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort.	11.489327594928971
Keys: like Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out.	9.237428395595227
No passout checks.	10.790984168578726
_Habeas corpus_.	14.509135749322695
I must see about that ad after the funeral.	14.825649083953161
Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office.	12.602464959949652
Be the better of a shave.	17.647869217345583
Grey sprouting beard.	8.578481455168589
That’s the first sign when the hairs come out grey.	13.59075116394405
Silver threads among the grey.	10.184484238114692
Fancy being his wife.	8.109616189835483
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl.	8.001636216880492
Dangle that before her.	5.64124210740405
It might thrill her first.	5.528516966390821
Courting death.	6.919632019531075
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about.	9.228645259785521
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark.	12.205558145786787
Will o’ the wisp.	9.630033308168029
Gas of graves.	8.763299953404267
Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all.	9.64111643062291
Women especially are so touchy.	11.029140418204156
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep.	11.076041652083386
Have you ever seen a ghost?	21.189669655222286
Well, I have.	11.441931732190517
It was a pitchdark night.	10.782896626711755
The clock was on the stroke of twelve.	10.536963978997168
Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up.	8.717386852024053
Whores in Turkish graveyards.	10.902633831490242
Learn anything if taken young.	7.382476709573113
You might pick up a young widow here.	9.927941432901212
Men like that.	4.739693022081733
Love among the tombstones.	14.66909354328122
Romeo.	32.172570290454246
In the midst of death we are in life.	10.644882444908358
Both ends meet.	8.929266360141819
Tantalising for the poor dead.	14.430840659292747
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving.	14.305382766919982
Gnawing their vitals.	11.841487982814357
Desire to grig people.	6.676347851391888
Molly wanting to do it at the window.	11.90930206573615
Eight children he has anyway.	14.702737405519834
He has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field.	10.539367363893124
Holy fields.	15.111906281989787
More room if they buried them standing.	9.675808420163436
Sitting or kneeling you couldn’t.	5.277830525613128
Standing?	32.172570290454246
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing.	14.52299487397619
All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells.	9.951272375309532
And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings.	7.850433989564102
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome.	7.43110992871624
Well, so it is.	10.052120816069275
Ought to be flowers of sleep.	12.950131844555761
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me.	5.233823597540089
The Botanic Gardens are just over there.	4.82561339509758
It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life.	11.146961803500261
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy.	6.514644642955531
Every man his price.	8.334226236803126
Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden.	5.059836020052142
A bargain.	12.651986113682064
By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six.	5.703840016162106
With thanks.	8.600157042503737
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails.	6.793036420945596
Charnelhouses.	32.172570290454246
Dreadful.	32.172570290454246
Turning green and pink decomposing.	10.415088630194559
The lean old ones tougher.	10.532943238293672
Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy.	17.4001670369125
Then dried up.	4.710213043486548
Deathmoths.	32.172570290454246
Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living.	11.041642246020857
Changing about.	7.001686785463719
Live for ever practically.	13.86176921832063
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.	8.869203150890343
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots.	13.444579196141762
Soil must be simply swirling with them.	7.417493120824673
Your head it simply swurls.	9.841622157588752
Those pretty little seaside gurls.	9.68418052410699
He looks cheerful enough over it.	5.088949867287214
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first.	12.542566051182371
Wonder how he looks at life.	9.08662578407902
Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart.	7.638752481494186
The one about the bulletin.	15.961517775612375
Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning.	9.261885405371522
11 p.m. (closing time).	5.896366213129378
Not arrived yet.	7.135656305844592
Peter.	25.535385961793953
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in fashion.	11.387010914303128
A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.	6.205359312688803
Keep out the damp.	13.762020077747174
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.	7.967837624234783
Gravediggers in _Hamlet_.	12.403053996551487
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.	10.038192083276874
Daren’t joke about the dead for two years at least.	15.39866220650796
Go out of mourning first.	12.732443914419182
Hard to imagine his funeral.	8.890486740940208
Seems a sort of a joke.	15.73581571262946
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.	10.027385127433767
Gives you second wind.	6.807465285372501
New lease of life.	4.8270217779267375
—How many have you for tomorrow?	20.391255274140157
—Two, Corny Kelleher said.	4.8000917401861924
Half ten and eleven.	8.082449135117807
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket.	10.908222787620733
The barrow had ceased to trundle.	9.902916499814454
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves.	11.509695382296798
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.	6.374530562473825
Burying him.	4.0396016986999586
We come to bury Cæsar.	16.320812827566918
His ides of March or June.	7.934138567129967
He doesn’t know who is here nor care.	11.936099544003019
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh?	15.823102480925892
Now who is he I’d like to know?	14.30906051645917
Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is.	10.463218557287883
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of.	7.256835603073599
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life.	9.380671612594158
Yes, he could.	15.483447698834198
Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave.	14.400196603123467
We all do.	6.619462567900373
Only man buries.	11.84022715228751
No, ants too.	8.890796675565504
First thing strikes anybody.	10.101461149468214
Bury the dead.	6.838926652923018
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life.	5.641523136322316
Well then Friday buried him.	4.639632494316524
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.	7.525679948448679
O, poor Robinson Crusoe! How could you possibly do so?	14.442022124784234
Poor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box.	12.804761591951733
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood.	10.170234601833997
All gnawed through.	8.224109814585361
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way.	8.777063220837647
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.	11.527143207157733
They’re so particular.	11.601986075534823
Lay me in my native earth.	11.33543064404572
Bit of clay from the holy land.	15.02746224218913
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin.	9.84916034689485
I see what it means.	15.965921738736256
I see.	5.865550534154977
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth.	11.60472092295608
The Irishman’s house is his coffin.	11.828099858394028
Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.	7.265094156426141
Mr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.	12.623931457000149
Twelve.	32.172570290454246
I’m thirteen.	19.597136913974072
No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen.	14.970016829185404
Death’s number.	16.596120997915513
Where the deuce did he pop out of?	13.761672881455228
He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear.	14.675227209206026
Silly superstition that about thirteen.	8.830389561036776
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit.	11.505626416560043
Tinge of purple.	10.782715316143964
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west.	12.980355232467298
Dressy fellow he was once.	10.578363289610019
Used to change three suits in the day.	8.896768681573107
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias.	11.041770558297923
Hello.	16.81846716713923
It’s dyed.	30.284028322970297
His wife I forgot he’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.	8.831652451571866
The coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles.	14.494988929053042
They struggled up and out: and all uncovered.	15.897783993201566
Twenty.	32.172570290454246
If we were all suddenly somebody else.	9.905417388063087
Far away a donkey brayed.	11.825014989629205
Never see a dead one, they say.	10.171390143179533
Shame of death.	6.687671213189715
They hide.	15.141877057334794
Also poor papa went away.	6.97581783773113
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper.	11.681633418748849
Whisper.	20.267449269082853
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space.	11.911451855332523
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.	16.183799124585622
Wellcut frockcoat.	12.531268249602594
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.	12.22472043429451
Well, it is a long rest.	17.53376145404993
Feel no more.	6.439680492124168
It’s the moment you feel.	10.963378232635858
Must be damned unpleasant.	19.21660872318131
Can’t believe it at first.	13.373153878247386
Mistake must be: someone else.	8.544031382420126
Wait, I wanted to.	10.703076301751484
I haven’t yet.	11.745856562437815
Then darkened deathchamber.	11.348370682799809
Light they want.	9.272908759472893
Whispering around you.	4.501838155535251
Would you like to see a priest?	19.417717232443987
Then rambling and wandering.	9.276138017732581
Delirium all you hid all your life.	6.594307253916161
The death struggle.	10.051834191389739
His sleep is not natural.	12.237982961499432
Press his lower eyelid.	9.22019730570649
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow.	14.046163550373002
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he’s doomed.	14.901828182245167
Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing him a woman.	12.825877696509286
Dying to embrace her in his shirt.	12.035232631731878
Last act of _Lucia.	13.505320359664235
Shall I nevermore behold thee_?	9.447681005470294
Bam! He expires.	17.653550317372776
Gone at last.	8.69027739683597
People talk about you a bit: forget you.	8.040697635153796
Don’t forget to pray for him.	8.69757288299362
Remember him in your prayers.	21.401422667801402
Even Parnell.	10.639009768835022
Ivy day dying out.	4.991814282303049
We are praying now for the repose of his soul.	12.699257565069987
Hoping you’re well and not in hell.	12.604766973807674
Nice change of air.	7.820517544169243
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.	17.393681767744457
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself?	18.376879971922683
They say you do when you shiver in the sun.	13.61497735191779
Someone walking over it.	4.057286856345331
Callboy’s warning.	25.451686750254954
Near you.	4.634651323597989
Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought.	11.300856070035055
Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.	14.483605550452372
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin.	9.952955236724623
Mr Bloom turned away his face.	10.636132636332835
And if he was alive all the time?	17.017273135492086
Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course.	11.165813300076097
Of course he is dead.	12.772658933476427
Monday he died.	8.88730174224148
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole.	12.83726564909428
Flag of distress.	11.564058977322793
Three days.	7.876662013669857
Rather long to keep them in summer.	12.038240682894228
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.	13.233464637163436
The clay fell softer.	10.085579666814827
Begin to be forgotten.	20.72118962950792
Out of sight, out of mind.	13.407301112889302
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat.	10.32801189988153
Had enough of it.	4.49048412710923
The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show.	8.896285105222344
Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves.	13.274270083967874
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook.	13.144782126105332
Ah, the names.	19.152524255707362
But he knows them all.	9.871836273377918
No: coming to me.	6.869336079964854
—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath.	10.567552400605457
What is your christian name?	13.408502790539185
I’m not sure.	13.192827204499732
—L, Mr Bloom said.	4.059985628033306
Leopold.	16.81846716713923
And you might put down M’Coy’s name too.	10.937368171952837
He asked me to.	6.164029043518329
—Charley, Hynes said writing.	8.599582133933568
I know.	6.625264570568742
He was on the _Freeman_ once.	14.774689653170594
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne.	16.020449205656217
Good idea a postmortem for doctors.	8.117647266728756
Find out what they imagine they know.	8.582792309585178
He died of a Tuesday.	19.311220292529285
Got the run.	14.5436276490846
Levanted with the cash of a few ads.	19.596494094778425
Charley, you’re my darling.	10.844909182340025
That was why he asked me to.	11.394327705677288
O well, does no harm.	11.010362204067013
I saw to that, M’Coy.	9.86973740254584
Thanks, old chap: much obliged.	12.03978277602226
Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.	5.972791703437187
—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...	7.972231172359906
He looked around.	16.831070654938024
—Macintosh.	14.509135749322695
Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said.	8.382552617082764
Where is he now?	12.314729249087208
—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling.	11.097272215105942
I don’t know who he is.	7.779368360204134
Is that his name?	15.590727021827004
He moved away, looking about him.	8.22287522597313
—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping.	10.388922197392924
I say, Hynes! Didn’t hear.	10.13497382051757
Where has he disappeared to?	8.827081909412048
Not a sign.	14.474346191813748
Well of all the.	6.270808480150982
Has anybody here seen?	11.359957325457486
Kay ee double ell.	10.00123682217453
Become invisible.	12.67267933312057
Good Lord, what became of him?	12.406853337633168
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.	7.508119583508248
—O, excuse me! He stepped aside nimbly.	17.181537574118877
Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole.	11.356058695159646
It rose.	7.919999973657108
Nearly over.	6.7082246848397125
A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades.	8.341886108030934
All uncovered again for a few instants.	15.724075359790417
The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump.	10.624125327495884
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow.	12.094272702026513
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean.	8.569824668880747
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass.	11.053041259321281
One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.	8.811465702761767
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.	11.253866464843254
His navelcord.	14.949365283168918
The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.	9.83383130052466
Thanks in silence.	7.668817873354872
Sorry, sir: trouble.	10.020879496600557
Headshake.	32.172570290454246
For yourselves just.	9.116268912674263
The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.	9.190930415135217
—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said.	11.049667619998647
We have time.	8.031121070093258
With awe Mr Power’s blank voice spoke: —Some say he is not in that grave at all.	12.601344222135962
That the coffin was filled with stones.	9.805516843772836
That one day he will come again.	9.716773112285507
Hynes shook his head.	5.836640249762101
—Parnell will never come again, he said.	6.00081814861728
He’s there, all that was mortal of him.	10.19219385041253
Peace to his ashes.	15.19201182912245
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’s hearts and hands.	7.313610778960022
More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living.	9.53494450578493
Pray for the repose of the soul of.	11.955810873493126
Does anybody really?	11.340391126688422
Plant him and have done with him.	7.797483727304182
Like down a coalshoot.	12.108302937173368
Then lump them together to save time.	6.167089794974311
All souls’ day.	5.227430092705327
Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave.	13.905421261358732
Ten shillings for the gardener.	21.157065664262635
He keeps it free of weeds.	8.615091351492069
Old man himself.	5.763178995599851
Bent down double with his shears clipping.	12.570773436813676
Who passed away.	5.787138378527639
Who departed this life.	5.327784303241653
As if they did it of their own accord.	18.332414491476275
Got the shove, all of them.	5.948642684462562
Who kicked the bucket.	6.489315378015279
More interesting if they told you what they were.	13.52587226709481
So and So, wheelwright.	10.106893759759897
I paid five shillings in the pound.	14.410006814560822
Or a woman’s with her saucepan.	16.130097271512096
I cooked good Irish stew.	7.687637841598359
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell.	10.708037664313263
Entered into rest the protestants put it.	4.212183520037486
Old Dr Murren’s.	4.736746073327237
The great physician called him home.	7.5544531319696935
Well it’s God’s acre for them.	10.185270274671032
Nice country residence.	10.352497726418186
Newly plastered and painted.	9.340306753174625
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the _Church Times._ Marriage ads they never try to beautify.	9.455695526157287
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil.	6.53903782570443
Better value that for the money.	9.01491714227382
Still, the flowers are more poetical.	17.723284987787423
The other gets rather tiresome, never withering.	10.079830329620666
Expresses nothing.	7.29472071468589
Immortelles.	32.172570290454246
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch.	9.209540285186332
Like stuffed.	15.045831905306336
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us.	6.220919611974941
Hoo! Not a budge out of him.	6.136211745818798
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him.	6.68813996245492
Dead animal even sadder.	9.865478984918285
Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.	10.592572482056068
The Sacred Heart that is: showing it.	6.1505338464858195
Heart on his sleeve.	17.56552999019006
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart.	12.665492721039714
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that.	7.2613763328229535
Seems anything but pleased.	10.028428367703562
Why this infliction?	13.22975114470669
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy.	12.018526400289227
Apollo that was.	5.901119183842478
How many! All these here once walked round Dublin.	8.584904666772637
Faithful departed.	15.088141794024638
As you are now so once were we.	10.488739342725143
Besides how could you remember everybody?	18.18928040220445
Eyes, walk, voice.	8.199053051632953
Well, the voice, yes: gramophone.	17.4508183974205
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house.	8.627981887067156
After dinner on a Sunday.	14.995707558385547
Put on poor old greatgrandfather.	12.189188588864344
Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth.	5.468560446020325
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face.	11.072282117604809
Otherwise you couldn’t remember the face after fifteen years, say.	9.286627251695084
For instance who?	16.098804093515714
For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.	8.60257933129342
Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles.	10.70024838967649
Stop! He looked down intently into a stone crypt.	20.02954778323056
Some animal.	12.711246193399209
There he goes.	12.979227418057722
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles.	8.758608922461596
An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes.	8.97119079711309
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.	5.762117881451499
Good hidingplace for treasure.	9.28153913263481
Who lives there?	8.436193419831119
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery.	9.49483748705996
Making his rounds.	14.172581695673562
Tail gone now.	4.880821295357513
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow.	12.145148403741794
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was.	7.167016785465671
Ordinary meat for them.	4.806017441171754
A corpse is meat gone bad.	6.880911600811611
Well and what’s cheese?	21.173526890802943
Corpse of milk.	8.864855350577232
I read in that _Voyages in China_ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.	12.129571268376349
Cremation better.	7.7952769643417925
Priests dead against it.	4.003440616404829
Devilling for the other firm.	21.756767377221635
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers.	7.2445678942059395
Time of the plague.	22.39056347724545
Quicklime feverpits to eat them.	5.639265251271247
Ashes to ashes.	7.934439852636219
Or bury at sea.	6.153923108338019
Where is that Parsee tower of silence?	14.052897933506351
Eaten by birds.	8.982041374462996
Earth, fire, water.	7.051978514412209
Drowning they say is the pleasantest.	16.720636583032896
See your whole life in a flash.	14.386563111488
But being brought back to life no.	9.79948261876525
Can’t bury in the air however.	18.997197752901002
Out of a flying machine.	19.20535227409919
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down.	7.198920717057066
Underground communication.	14.833002552262101
We learned that from them.	6.319493749515706
Wouldn’t be surprised.	17.071679994620247
Regular square feed for them.	4.761985113944594
Flies come before he’s well dead.	10.038877225376723
Got wind of Dignam.	8.351183883188618
They wouldn’t care about the smell of it.	9.512813833055116
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.	5.838579070376186
The gates glimmered in front: still open.	6.402420099629152
Back to the world again.	12.807792691883284
Enough of this place.	12.18894460682767
Brings you a bit nearer every time.	9.41170145278572
Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico’s funeral.	12.142011816068056
Poor papa too.	6.0430665966912445
The love that kills.	11.824867151733285
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores.	9.995440042973184
Give you the creeps after a bit.	9.963175813233393
I will appear to you after death.	13.281832039362888
You will see my ghost after death.	8.614435879260588
My ghost will haunt you after death.	5.882945727660822
There is another world after death named hell.	12.412723922617719
I do not like that other world she wrote.	13.893135394079216
No more do I.	6.953647265013041
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet.	8.1903096218624
Feel live warm beings near you.	4.490435287692572
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds.	14.188950975358328
They are not going to get me this innings.	16.65335768153686
Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.	5.086078593615614
Solicitor, I think.	9.248196580188486
I know his face.	7.171739521643282
Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits.	8.327853911018513
Dignam used to be in his office.	13.078938829526708
Mat Dillon’s long ago.	10.068475032636465
Jolly Mat.	15.101486301579408
Convivial evenings.	15.111906281989787
Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses.	8.729963150675447
Heart of gold really.	12.318154640123684
Yes, Menton.	29.72938543180824
Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him.	8.463840987687396
Pure fluke of mine: the bias.	13.473811925552592
Why he took such a rooted dislike to me.	7.709139428890407
Hate at first sight.	11.737446121674111
Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing.	8.429167735926592
Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.	7.473652068446658
Got a dinge in the side of his hat.	12.011418774158653
Carriage probably.	7.674379201751439
—Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.	8.783467535790852
They stopped.	8.410956501700742
—Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.	13.649336483226774
John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.	13.475394410945857
—There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.	9.933147785240502
John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve.	10.405181391571118
He clapped the hat on his head again.	8.586754781045531
—It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.	7.391918871390241
John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.	14.425353142696414
—Thank you, he said shortly.	12.71622745205627
They walked on towards the gates.	14.395576443913571
Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear.	13.199730408653496
Martin laying down the law.	10.381574299969067
Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.	7.0093410748076135
Oyster eyes.	5.455646160485135
Never mind.	7.5190512009065795
Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.	5.264836325197074
Get the pull over him that way.	7.467291871209231
How grand we are this morning! [ 7 ] IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS Before Nelson’s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started for Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure, Palmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold’s Cross.	6.2254379825841655
—Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN Under the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and polished.	8.314778742934967
Parked in North Prince’s street His Majesty’s vermilion mailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E.	9.377563993752318
R., received loudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels, insured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.	5.96885302273996
GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS Grossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince’s stores and bumped them up on the brewery float.	11.002496616752909
On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince’s stores.	10.911857722256741
—There it is, Red Murray said.	6.598797419437141
Alexander Keyes.	11.385285544623772
—Just cut it out, will you?	9.708764825171613
Mr Bloom said, and I’ll take it round to the _Telegraph_ office.	13.03297345131694
The door of Ruttledge’s office creaked again.	10.043102380062784
Davy Stephens, minute in a large capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with a roll of papers under his cape, a king’s courier.	13.08937530013393
Red Murray’s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper in four clean strokes.	11.956318018692127
Scissors and paste.	10.245869058640656
—I’ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut square.	12.509954537258817
—Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind his ear, we can do him one.	10.66529709964053
—Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod.	13.855410282471926
I’ll rub that in.	10.103382479606289
We. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT Red Murray touched Mr Bloom’s arm with the shears and whispered: —Brayden.	8.758737923058499
Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _Weekly Freeman and National Press_ and the _Freeman’s Journal and National Press_.	10.492438565190271
Dullthudding Guinness’s barrels.	17.621517378596273
It passed statelily up the staircase, steered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face.	8.642272177042956
The broadcloth back ascended each step: back.	4.803160940044086
All his brains are in the nape of his neck, Simon Dedalus says.	13.929571698116812
Fat folds of neck, fat, neck, fat, neck.	5.963831166365941
—Don’t you think his face is like Our Saviour?	12.892117010533548
Red Murray whispered.	11.53648756310214
The door of Ruttledge’s office whispered: ee: cree.	12.265487662372186
They always build one door opposite another for the wind to.	7.847441755120582
Way in.	5.9564754354109395
Way out.	5.290343465284296
Our Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk.	11.509864130397139
Mary, Martha.	15.811510288287097
Steered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.	12.378528318931554
—Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.	4.8157001310230045
—Yes, Red Murray agreed.	13.282305048290034
But Mario was said to be the picture of Our Saviour.	10.590474456464264
Jesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs.	6.0139922208756
Hand on his heart.	11.95475450455037
In _Martha._ Co-ome thou lost one, Co-ome thou dear one! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN —His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.	7.275631597456884
They watched the knees, legs, boots vanish.	9.473310352157347
Neck.	32.172570290454246
A telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word: _—Freeman!_ Mr Bloom said slowly: —Well, he is one of our saviours also.	11.837369213533805
A meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed in through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage, along the now reverberating boards.	9.26617499925619
But will he save the circulation?	14.16298327498915
Thumping.	22.307214335724723
Thumping.	22.307214335724723
He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper.	7.309286218407707
Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards Nannetti’s reading closet.	10.11564320848633
WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS Hynes here too: account of the funeral probably.	6.120494963241264
Thumping.	22.307214335724723
Thump.	32.172570290454246
This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.	8.436040709962576
Machines.	32.172570290454246
Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught.	11.518207224375926
Rule the world today.	11.078955566334072
His machineries are pegging away too.	4.236403987041373
Working away, tearing away.	7.110606359012841
And that old grey rat tearing to get in.	8.452507014738593
HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.	8.35559223844346
Strange he never saw his real country.	10.99881083165631
Ireland my country.	10.69282379853165
Member for College green.	7.309426859097755

—Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.	8.501241034940653
Soon be calling him my lord mayor.	10.970217579893829
Long John is backing him, they say.	7.692781681931641
The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter.	13.200969692306188
He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glass screen.	12.706130610714439
—Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.	6.794545017043161
Mr Bloom stood in his way.	14.164043115718622
—If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said, pointing backward with his thumb.	12.738382032798382
—Did you?	8.77040262212197
Hynes asked.	5.295771030513646
—Mm, Mr Bloom said.	3.9555442899818547
Look sharp and you’ll catch him.	7.331247762440702
—Thanks, old man, Hynes said.	6.258934405769853
I’ll tap him too.	9.483817971969527
He hurried on eagerly towards the _Freeman’s Journal_.	13.745752825183246

Third hint.	15.009292486789496
WE SEE THE CANVASSER AT WORK Mr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti’s desk.	9.615870149385666
—Excuse me, councillor, he said.	5.695731599090448
This ad, you see.	6.714984611324971
Keyes, you remember?	23.48717603649765
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.	6.531252997275425
—He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.	8.049449073710136
The foreman moved his pencil towards it.	5.002097433939729
—But wait, Mr Bloom said.	5.831157096906022
He wants it changed.	11.157905813914088
Keyes, you see.	7.739669365124349
He wants two keys at the top.	12.752593574903564
Hell of a racket they make.	15.964923721998845
He doesn’t hear it.	6.666291853506998
Nannan.	32.172570290454246
Iron nerves.	11.359061219992771
Maybe he understands what I.	4.938731483378465
The foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.	13.360630298723324
—Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.	11.041722129725626
Let him take that in first.	11.551959965146533
Mr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the foreman’s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper.	11.05666299630068
Clank it.	3.903055991727408
Clank it.	3.903055991727408
Miles of it unreeled.	22.908127660809804
What becomes of it after?	14.281731502983702
O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and one things.	8.134731330866474
Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly on the scarred woodwork.	14.312969521226611
HOUSE OF KEY(E)S —Like that, see.	5.5630123758574115
Two crossed keys here.	5.04474993906638
A circle.	11.460465231628643
Then here the name.	6.22382517984249
Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant.	9.224530165649103
Better not teach him his own business.	13.93857714374053
Then round the top in leaded: the house of keys.	10.802442915455902
You see?	12.775607886496761
Do you think that’s a good idea?	17.828772558324403
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly.	8.769070209812995
—The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys.	13.238511398118238
You know, councillor, the Manx parliament.	16.282853367551066
Innuendo of home rule.	11.749713379184877
Tourists, you know, from the isle of Man.	13.176123223223751
Catches the eye, you see.	7.325842933556324
Can you do that?	12.211957376369242
I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that _voglio._ But then if he didn’t know only make it awkward for him.	9.889210578530102
Better not.	7.974630046920103
—We can do that, the foreman said.	9.165798714898447
Have you the design?	21.66857920351789
—I can get it, Mr Bloom said.	9.020122720676213
It was in a Kilkenny paper.	13.148744776331684
He has a house there too.	8.902484842851457
I’ll just run out and ask him.	10.0464213986184
Well, you can do that and just a little par calling attention.	16.070840198940676
You know the usual.	15.03907826560941
Highclass licensed premises.	8.426591391131083
Longfelt want.	10.141834232524793
The foreman thought for an instant.	9.847422078120987
—We can do that, he said.	6.122133748481588
Let him give us a three months’ renewal.	11.309820881399249
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage.	12.70534059508619
He began to check it silently.	11.186028773221484
Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silent typesetters at their cases.	9.48649161414217

Cemetery put in of course on account of the symmetry.	12.39164125663978
I should have said when he clapped on his topper.	20.367342876684262
I ought to have said something about an old hat or something.	10.850550852550231
No. I could have said.	7.450116916061547
Looks as good as new now.	6.771339994106363

NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying: —Wait.	7.410407038657702
Where’s the archbishop’s letter?	19.130826669894827
It’s to be repeated in the _Telegraph._ Where’s what’s his name?	12.991553697779912
He looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.	13.579631821545313
a voice asked from the castingbox.	21.397547105268107
—Ay. Where’s Monks?	19.04402701068411
Time to get out.	7.788956543686316
—Then I’ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you’ll give it a good place I know.	12.095658401874543
—Monks! —Yes, sir.	7.183994826386343
Three months’ renewal.	8.403132807616563
Want to get some wind off my chest first.	12.718927739228628

Nearing the end of his tether now.	8.84452806772877

And then the lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the butcher.	19.55933736584519
And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat.	11.744997307609353
Sounds a bit silly till you come to look into it well.	13.415528373545563
Justice it means but it’s everybody eating everyone else.	9.69679279231597

Practice makes perfect.	11.933830605519347
Seems to see with his fingers.	14.161339471660618
Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him out perhaps.	13.924040250302346
Better phone him up first.	7.681690401664472

Just to see: before: dressing.	9.08139899828194
No. Here.	13.185170761994412
No. A sudden screech of laughter came from the _Evening Telegraph_ office.	10.059096541190712
Know who that is.	5.45165427345211
What’s up?	13.181922988945573
Pop in a minute to phone.	12.994930330988032
Ned Lambert it is.	6.472994964639114
He entered softly.	9.331266975120352
ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA —The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane.	9.459488449153186
Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face, asked of it sourly: —Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?	14.212136938863598
Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on: —_Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters of Neptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest_.	9.580974529493227
What about that, Simon?	18.84353687439297
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	20.70663668365495
How’s that for high?	17.87918518317474
—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.	4.87195381534617
Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating: —_The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage_.	12.555632615400295
O boys! O boys! —And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on the fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.	13.283093490112872
—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window.	13.067904424092498
I don’t want to hear any more of the stuff.	14.879342050053195
He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.	9.53721930999161
High falutin stuff.	7.3184950838167415
Bladderbags.	32.172570290454246
Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.	7.812258789666683
Rather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does.	11.672070072976622
He has influence they say.	8.369697162146865
Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.	12.832525358456621

—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.	5.055566794625672
—What is it?	8.031263818381309
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone.	8.630080594342084
_Our lovely land_.	11.542930578058101
SHORT BUT TO THE POINT —Whose land?	7.959591855331465
Mr Bloom said simply.	16.547635977424374
—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews.	12.003363692981058
With an accent on the whose.	16.224574573974817
—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.	6.610274323960272
—Is it his speech last night?	14.086590273100306
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
Ned Lambert nodded.	16.468776851287835
—But listen to this, he said.	6.472313906098962
The doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was pushed in.	10.668655007757048
—Excuse me, J.	7.039178156329375
O’Molloy said, entering.	17.711483349353042
Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside.	13.639209670766956
—I beg yours, he said.	8.382867988539633
—Good day, Jack.	11.883953742947037
—Come in.	6.298197740387702
Come in.	5.9564754354109395
—Good day.	6.847681277637786
—How are you, Dedalus?	18.57720422612597
—Well.	11.842125204420263
And yourself?	10.985989727871456
O’Molloy shook his head.	9.906937900349934

—_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks._ —You’re looking extra.	8.959728768108393
—Is the editor to be seen?	16.712366776770626
—Very much so, professor MacHugh said.	6.120365887779157
To be seen and heard.	9.949084779244666
He’s in his sanctum with Lenehan.	11.084341363336586
O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file.	15.95735698430071
Practice dwindling.	14.833002552262101

Myles Crawford began on the _Independent._ Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening.	13.242681102370822
Weathercocks.	32.172570290454246
Hot and cold in the same breath.	12.163067343364698
Wouldn’t know which to believe.	12.49774767240728
One story good till you hear the next.	8.953067875591753
Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows over.	12.931009121763209
Hail fellow well met the next moment.	7.518362048253695
—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded.	11.677504884713125
_Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks..._ —Bombast! the professor broke in testily.	8.015921469490378
Enough of the inflated windbag! —_Peaks_, Ned Lambert went on, _towering high on high, to bathe our souls, as it were..._ —Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said.	8.769739783149408
Is he taking anything for it?	11.332866764851497
He forgot Hamlet.	11.913838836303542
_—That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of the moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence..._ —O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan.	10.630033820967837
Shite and onions! That’ll do, Ned.	10.564888179746537
Life is too short.	13.644241402142999
He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.	7.734883727558849
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight.	9.308872563669027
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshaven blackspectacled face.	9.262651358784327
—Doughy Daw! he cried.	6.608481600901975
WHAT WETHERUP SAID All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cake that stuff.	7.652318978245207
He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he?	12.07907079599205
Why they call him Doughy Daw.	14.39473395017953
Hooked that nicely.	9.47210135117747
Entertainments.	32.172570290454246
Open house.	6.4284668494871555
Big blowout.	12.200680240034972
Wetherup always said that.	5.14801511277476
Get a grip of them by the stomach.	14.079582896000131
The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in.	8.185490284035847
The bold blue eyes stared about them and the harsh voice asked: —What is it?	9.656638511459828
—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.	10.370119269631086
I must get a drink after that.	10.24147833512801
—Drink! the editor cried.	6.16976717230328
No drinks served before mass.	7.082251401913063
—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out.	9.780419102265405
Come on, Ned.	11.22481190305511
Ned Lambert sidled down from the table.	10.86821534925489
The editor’s blue eyes roved towards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.	11.781443154448839
—Will you join us, Myles?	14.635055897565373
MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED —North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece.	8.47232070512213
We won every time! North Cork and Spanish officers! —Where was that, Myles?	11.097146163367036
Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps.	19.55825205566155
—In Ohio! the editor shouted.	12.606898689674564
—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.	10.131570812194804
Passing out he whispered to J.	6.4829634652817205
O’Molloy: —Incipient jigs.	17.27708364496391
Sad case.	8.724260627598019
—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.	7.262568075111016
My Ohio! —A perfect cretic! the professor said.	6.721321794425504
O, HARP EOLIAN! He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.	10.24467632335046
—Bingbang, bangbang.	8.257273101586387
Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.	11.431201704975557
—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said.	7.38208916305927
He went in.	6.517843116440476
—What about that leader this evening?	17.33752879763977
professor MacHugh asked, coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.	11.719658747955688
—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly.	12.728515643982966
Never you fret.	11.563410327368508
Hello, Jack.	13.170005328289694
That’s all right.	7.784527266330787
—Good day, Myles, J.	7.2775668025045235
O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file.	11.820050524880646
Is that Canada swindle case on today?	10.774491448320799
The telephone whirred inside.	8.186788105492552
—Twentyeight...	2.4792043210937615
No, twenty...	4.887071771507804
Double four...	2.577225251411055
SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _Sport_’s tissues.	11.667439714238645
—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup?	16.40844782986413
he asked.	5.571194519539272
Sceptre with O.	6.678097688320904
Madden up.	4.963090012978215
He tossed the tissues on to the table.	8.165419412691866
Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flung open.	10.466449092553363
—Hush, Lenehan said.	3.409644071247619
I hear feetstoops.	19.827812297964854
Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps.	11.373594551136362
The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under the table came to earth.	10.828565788670378
—It wasn’t me, sir.	9.081643103751668
It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.	9.08930161515396
—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said.	6.8437997638936325
There’s a hurricane blowing.	14.404687460473667
Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stooped twice.	11.18249894733587
—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said.	7.839284703113226
It was Pat Farrell shoved me, sir.	7.901420296072948
He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.	9.66093311016077
—Him, sir.	5.163196410645108
—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.	12.145580172750492
He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.	6.99021547636904
O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking: —Continued on page six, column four.	8.812008682283325
—Yes, _Evening Telegraph_ here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office.	13.387737707459276
Is the boss...?	7.128256658226752
Yes, _Telegraph_...	5.232896943587226
To where?	18.982156677670528
Aha! Which auction rooms?...	3.901406741787862
Aha! I see...	4.648417123956792
Right.	16.81846716713923
I’ll catch him.	8.569287545250203
A COLLISION ENSUES The bell whirred again as he rang off.	6.49121318729936
He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.	13.67995332648825
—_Pardon, monsieur_, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making a grimace.	9.61648840503777
—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip.	11.708620743989698
Are you hurt?	23.74071392880926
I’m in a hurry.	16.042149042471532
—Knee, Lenehan said.	3.3601244288536263
He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee: —The accumulation of the _anno Domini_.	11.823451659077095
—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.	4.495070604005135
He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused.	12.994836924552592
O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over.	9.792468514358928
The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps: We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand.	9.8175146746922
EXIT BLOOM —I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this ad of Keyes’s.	8.849915373356964
Want to fix it up.	7.477843225346782
They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s.	8.801098309748173
He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces.	14.888226969552049
The editor who, leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.	11.961962556294367
—Begone! he said.	3.6706390910234306
The world is before you.	6.03146097808816
—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.	9.385873394380644
O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing them apart gently, without comment.	14.353273664305366
—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind.	14.343996099977442
Look at the young scamps after him.	8.478939437056155
—Show.	16.29095728541431
Where?	14.052664453048125
Lenehan cried, running to the window.	10.672332840052155
A STREET CORTÈGE Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of white bowknots.	11.855780386894388
—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and you’ll kick.	11.848911634403905
O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.	11.618091087143817
Small nines.	14.833002552262101
Steal upon larks.	11.553119915265171
He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet past the fireplace to J.	6.814403182419992
O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.	10.743791350446505
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
Myles Crawford said with a start.	17.534698051446416
Where are the other two gone?	20.47781094453473
—Who?	11.362660442813608
the professor said, turning.	11.123734821350512
They’re gone round to the Oval for a drink.	13.996204114723703
Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall.	11.707911796731011
Came over last night.	5.681977815914634
—Come on then, Myles Crawford said.	6.777064485970669
Where’s my hat?	21.74173526376092
He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket.	10.295055740562725
They jingled then in the air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.	12.092955201912174
—Seems to be, J.	6.664552833269222
O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems.	12.575519273179648
Who has the most matches?	20.889514600569704
THE CALUMET OF PEACE He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself.	8.05799606752623
Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn.	8.088001442181831
O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.	9.191779133716787
—_Thanky vous_, Lenehan said, helping himself.	6.910636158486904
The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow.	14.167300018875705
He declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh: ’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee, ’Twas empire charmed thy heart.	6.03621123887068
The professor grinned, locking his long lips.	5.87067900531966
—Eh?	11.52577618932958
You bloody old Roman empire?	13.646716615855425
Myles Crawford said.	3.6998611883181507
He took a cigarette from the open case.	12.98746296956684
Lenehan, lighting it for him with quick grace, said: —Silence for my brandnew riddle! —_Imperium romanum_, J.	10.71126596945485
O’Molloy said gently.	12.418175820562631
It sounds nobler than British or Brixton.	7.35868524017592
The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.	9.26228571771364
Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.	12.360511376196522
—That’s it, he said.	5.14435365884854
We are the fat.	12.547995167352864
You and I are the fat in the fire.	14.28077941910746
We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.	11.407118674224249
THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME —Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws.	7.768171973139181
We mustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words.	9.917206002922399
We think of Rome, imperial, imperious, imperative.	6.901841604338059
He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing: —What was their civilisation?	8.041781418068178
Vast, I allow: but vile.	16.855000179920975
Cloacae: sewers.	11.563683322789208
The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: _It is meet to be here.	11.00255125944919
Let us build an altar to Jehovah_.	9.561075289863
The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession.	9.929572540466022
Our old ancient ancestors, as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the running stream.	12.35928519280058
—They were nature’s gentlemen, J.	12.027903303494798
O’Molloy murmured.	19.884275445238202
But we have also Roman law.	9.917622142846934
—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.	9.169108366631697
O’Molloy asked.	9.925011150316692
It was at the royal university dinner.	18.427793847545455
Everything was going swimmingly ...	4.072042545616307
—First my riddle, Lenehan said.	4.65973424740402
Are you ready?	25.878417078207416
Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.	17.135257515089567
—_Entrez, mes enfants!_ Lenehan cried.	6.819231768567135
—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously.	11.82517336319668
Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety.	8.893573386208605
—How do you do?	12.283682004634262
the editor said, holding out a hand.	12.124213474607977
Come in.	5.9564754354109395
Your governor is just gone.	6.266224602788126
???	18.287538016078535
Lenehan said to all: —Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline?	14.313151275420472
Reflect, ponder, excogitate, reply.	5.417127756628154
Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.	11.696995193941921
—Who?	11.362660442813608
Bit torn off.	5.687918224733873
—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.	4.77569070738914
—That old pelters, the editor said.	7.321208941593755
Who tore it?	6.626242015496177
Was he short taken?	17.257701763733685
On swift sail flaming From storm and south He comes, pale vampire, Mouth to my mouth.	5.610200425803335
—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their shoulders.	9.195417415622655
Foot and mouth?	15.816478283724315
Are you turned...?	8.897144810261404
Bullockbefriending bard.	10.537498549673511
SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT —Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing.	9.178915317953019
The letter is not mine.	10.988540070225014
Mr Garrett Deasy asked me to...	3.9548220979299917
—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too.	11.260051254686083
The bloodiest old tartar God ever made.	7.198114989050685
By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth disease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face in the Star and Garter.	13.778811624272553
Oho! A woman brought sin into the world.	8.758297752467888
For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeks.	8.799195284138953
O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.	11.087940143719123
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the typescript.	15.15108951075189
Emperor’s horses.	21.040313192286654
Habsburg.	32.172570290454246
An Irishman saved his life on the ramparts of Vienna.	10.902369957269661
Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf von Tirconnell in Ireland.	7.162334844350455
Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrian fieldmarshal now.	7.049415441377728
Going to be trouble there one day.	10.896839540462954
Wild geese.	9.371124374545373
O yes, every time.	8.493063889112866
O’Molloy said quietly, turning a horseshoe paperweight.	11.721771558979095
Saving princes is a thank you job.	10.813148043254092
Professor MacHugh turned on him.	5.789739631922644
—And if not?	16.85919406829917
he said.	3.3900725752648877
—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began.	13.24957817656922
A Hungarian it was one day...	5.343916508826647
LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED —We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said.	5.886477948935767
Success for us is the death of the intellect and of the imagination.	18.946291875930537
We were never loyal to the successful.	20.12941126759651
I teach the blatant Latin language.	6.886573724478562
I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.	8.51461590719713
Material domination.	12.200680240034972
_Dominus!_ Lord! Where is the spirituality?	19.444476375623754
Lord Jesus?	18.92677129939432
Lord Salisbury?	17.17289249749927
A sofa in a westend club.	14.594543688058879
But the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON! A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.	8.927323093560414
—The Greek! he said again.	13.447205462162078
_Kyrios!_ Shining word! The vowels the Semite and the Saxon know not.	10.707355291745236
_Kyrie!_ The radiance of the intellect.	19.37565276299197
I ought to profess Greek, the language of the mind.	12.103397996832616
_Kyrie eleison!_ The closetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit.	12.693466928922007
We are liege subjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and of the empire of the spirit, not an _imperium,_ that went under with the Athenian fleets at Aegospotami.	10.957859828421764
Yes, yes.	10.329998245355132
They went under.	16.77872315584183
Loyal to a lost cause.	13.322912109675205
He strode away from them towards the window.	10.874667683175709
—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they always fell.	11.21120945608056
—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise.	10.345049993435014
Owing to a brick received in the latter half of the _matinée_.	21.46467823463548
Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus! He whispered then near Stephen’s ear: LENEHAN’S LIMERICK —_There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh Who wears goggles of ebony hue.	8.227439285417608
As he mostly sees double To wear them why trouble?	8.958154005592597
I can’t see the Joe Miller.	12.609702041535055
Can you?_ In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says.	10.053201455144848
Whose mother is beastly dead.	6.856236766853062
Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.	11.244641047573296
—That’ll be all right, he said.	7.652406522598475
I’ll read the rest after.	14.804905331364417
Lenehan extended his hands in protest.	11.071089097470429
—But my riddle! he said.	6.211482451920977
What opera is like a railwayline?	15.304492803458782
—Opera?	18.280183293229488
Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.	13.672725502080569
Lenehan announced gladly: —_The Rose of Castile_.	12.280615308165542
See the wheeze?	22.16807758204088
Rows of cast steel.	9.674353839950044
Gee! He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen.	14.106011191618206
Mr O’Madden Burke fell back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.	11.32407012568756
—Help! he sighed.	11.495250697103963
I feel a strong weakness.	15.250912889037522
Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.	11.380660727722358
The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.	10.822318337593845
You look like communards.	14.999070321351365
—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J.	7.601033676321685
O’Molloy said in quiet mockery.	13.500205260236456
Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?	6.863570657890136
You look as though you had done the deed.	9.91391238061663
General Bobrikoff.	14.509135749322695
OMNIUM GATHERUM —We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.	7.013435148548187
—All the talents, Myles Crawford said.	4.592222095794336
—The turf, Lenehan put in.	10.752498490389494
—Literature, the press.	11.96163379199866
—If Bloom were here, the professor said.	6.027232544103834
The gentle art of advertisement.	9.264805716018621
—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added.	13.830854197591472
The vocal muse.	9.107917202179157
Dublin’s prime favourite.	22.61843368011393
Lenehan gave a loud cough.	11.991861762137635
—Ahem! he said very softly.	10.300895521445053
O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a cold in the park.	13.513987162594344
The gate was open.	6.478303347199311
“YOU CAN DO IT!” The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.	7.3796359408630705
—I want you to write something for me, he said.	10.028982219163794
Something with a bite in it.	7.54368470192564
You can do it.	6.376378730524822
I see it in your face.	10.476384056989012
See it in your face.	8.773753386160754
See it in your eye.	10.434495856620625
Lazy idle little schemer.	8.559741910529455
Great nationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory.	8.353909835948881
All balls! Bulldosing the public! Give them something with a bite in it.	6.665901343062855
Put us all into it, damn its soul.	10.245557986525636
Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.	8.96191126346136
—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	6.149540027305113
Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.	13.184507322329162
O’Molloy said.	5.225530749791196
THE GREAT GALLAHER —You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.	11.003300103945922
Wait a minute.	11.803185589055946
We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.	14.39515496925329
Gallaher, that was a pressman for you.	9.58144003006244
That was a pen.	22.462610682350686
You know how he made his mark?	20.817833905589236
I’ll tell you.	7.528949360066346
That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known.	10.31746794849304
That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I suppose.	10.877500446938493
I’ll show you.	8.749908860261693
He pushed past them to the files.	16.567526280033555
—Look at here, he said turning.	13.743540070576355
The _New York World_ cabled for a special.	10.863384023660954
Remember that time?	13.424125680144321
Professor MacHugh nodded.	11.039629253433223
—_New York World_, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.	8.147026420528448
Where it took place.	7.101872605058234
Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean.	8.23765400970332
Joe Brady and the rest of them.	7.99760274991208
Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car.	6.012856683768277
Whole route, see?	7.804940784835873
—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	5.5513371094192365
Fitzharris.	32.172570290454246
He has that cabman’s shelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge.	12.181108562438581
Holohan told me.	4.465430452922665
You know Holohan?	24.505114755962904
—Hop and carry one, is it?	6.827965573352357
Myles Crawford said.	3.6998611883181507
—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for the corporation.	15.58327523109281
A night watchman.	11.87467763320896
Stephen turned in surprise.	11.2297325492239
—Gumley?	18.619807201297416
he said.	3.3900725752648877
You don’t say so?	12.321241985640164
A friend of my father’s, is it?	9.446945105333393
Let Gumley mind the stones, see they don’t run away.	8.189086767850926
What did Ignatius Gallaher do?	11.828049028026681
I’ll tell you.	7.528949360066346
Inspiration of genius.	9.890424374899503
Cabled right away.	5.791039378454895
Have you _Weekly Freeman_ of 17 March?	17.425264392245275
Right.	16.81846716713923
Have you got that?	10.261020504314537
He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.	11.457493627590909
—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say.	8.706232705960076
Have you got that?	10.261020504314537
Right.	16.81846716713923
The telephone whirred.	11.04168139222325
A DISTANT VOICE —I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.	10.216065012027938
—B is parkgate.	9.867950269956038
Good.	20.267449269082853
His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.	7.211924868141605
—T is viceregal lodge.	7.603163504866108
C is where murder took place.	6.380858473085468
K is Knockmaroon gate.	6.7863174885184385
The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles.	18.838977679862616
An illstarched dicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.	10.204247209323448
—Hello?	22.526475044341577
_Evening Telegraph_ here...	3.137123677878768
Hello?...	2.5114601465383135
Who’s there?...	4.520891661648348
Yes...	2.852335531860807
Yes...	2.852335531860807
—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh.	6.325926693170247
X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.	8.05247270300932
The professor came to the inner door.	12.011971645132117
—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.	8.209961482690364
—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly.	15.74900649965814
X is Davy’s publichouse, see?	10.187742666134039
Very.	32.172570290454246
—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody history.	12.023606375593346
Nightmare from which you will never awake.	13.157160219605473
—I saw it, the editor said proudly.	19.14279763256677
I was present.	21.735637218298994
Dick Adams, the besthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.	10.165591879947762
Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing: —Madam, I’m Adam.	15.003277919787333
And Able was I ere I saw Elba.	11.844899769877477
—History! Myles Crawford cried.	7.533619952946415
The Old Woman of Prince’s street was there first.	8.74291840756491
There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that.	6.080702605733915
Out of an advertisement.	20.482854502267124
Gregor Grey made the design for it.	5.556989157794537
That gave him the leg up.	7.323211810526895
Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the _Star._ Now he’s got in with Blumenfeld.	10.94917880949092
That’s press.	18.502684693062353
That’s talent.	31.02446577707649
Are you there?...	4.2880590426427325
Yes, he’s here still.	10.940487325444488
Come across yourself.	7.4638115119842885
—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh?	12.98598793651261
the editor cried.	7.761191260139761
He flung the pages down.	6.9433224034424805
—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.	9.088952818993372
—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	6.757833101920378
Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.	10.812307924087767
—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers were up before the recorder...	7.564298577924705
—O yes, J.	9.89360686749674
O’Molloy said eagerly.	13.720386251455913
Lady Dudley was walking home through the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin.	10.785550874198783
And it turned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat.	8.170842874557803
Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine! —They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.	7.166026865105704
Psha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.	15.124823252019269
Ah, bloody nonsense.	18.652132016307352
Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.	12.12019019502569
His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.	6.137120050634478
Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss?	11.915706264722829
How do you know?	17.748672609656417
RHYMES AND REASONS Mouth, south.	6.310157372570918
Is the mouth south someway?	19.168835915125726
Or the south a mouth?	12.468062041332526
Must be some.	16.159354257001134
South, pout, out, shout, drouth.	6.940306093537056
Rhymes: two men dressed the same, looking the same, two by two.	8.174417062300568
........................	2.0335946507159512
la tua pace ..................	2.0895242118020123
che parlar ti piace Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.	5.764458263656332
He saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in russet, entwining, _per l’aer perso_, in mauve, in purple, _quella pacifica oriafiamma_, gold of oriflamme, _di rimirar fè più ardenti._ But I old men, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb womb.	7.206068549237482
—Speak up for yourself, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	6.6075256526730275
SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY...	2.7944729083655218
O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.	13.421571542519027
—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false construction on my words.	10.738233661980454
I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the third profession _qua_ profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.	6.889306483635841
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?	8.178784017911727
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention _Paddy Kelly’s Budget_, _Pue’s Occurrences_ and our watchful friend _The Skibbereen Eagle_.	11.816731601688414
Why bring in a master of forensic eloquence like Whiteside?	11.508932929602933
Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.	21.110665788862523
LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE —Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his face.	7.437294654089834
Where are you now?	13.910375365819323
Established 1763.	6.3267907186750385
Dr Lucas.	14.509135749322695
Who have you now like John Philpot Curran?	11.273683110074348
Psha! —Well, J.	10.219791129928995
O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.	12.722751463241417
—Bushe?	18.785090205254438
the editor said.	3.801093264900167
Well, yes: Bushe, yes.	10.596348733968522
He has a strain of it in his blood.	14.842305266737046
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.	11.112956953205547
—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for ....	9.016044486441615
But no matter.	8.936127311400746
O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly: —One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe.	13.248190373853292
It was in that case of fratricide, the Childs murder case.	14.76715648852484
Bushe defended him.	3.8699795055791495
_And in the porches of mine ear did pour._ By the way how did he find that out?	14.119687565518817
He died in his sleep.	14.397665286131184
Or the other story, beast with two backs?	18.081231814918215
—What was that?	10.86182345121987
the professor asked.	8.038874898814724
ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM —He spoke on the law of evidence, J.	8.413041014313473
O’Molloy said, of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the _lex talionis_.	11.667413404612837
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.	14.282085402445734
—Ha. —A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced.	13.934258296246941
Silence! Pause.	13.281507214499067
O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.	18.465988671371782
False lull.	14.509135749322695
Something quite ordinary.	11.908338047659997
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.	8.409165434885919
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives.	11.041784743101898
A POLISHED PERIOD J.	4.128422497206696
O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words: —He said of it: _that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live, deserves to live._ His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.	9.15184579694773
—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.	8.611288058988274
—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.	7.3350234493261945
—You like it?	10.885168396490544
O’Molloy asked Stephen.	11.106119348979782
Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed.	11.201450905555378
He took a cigarette from the case.	12.294136053053613
O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.	10.014749627210037
Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying: —Muchibus thankibus.	9.015230369627897
A MAN OF HIGH MORALE —Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J.	6.752318437764053
O’Molloy said to Stephen.	10.358584790958542
What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.	10.944056808027456
E.	10.594970405422256
the mastermystic?	17.17289249749927
That Blavatsky woman started it.	3.8150268951771893
She was a nice old bag of tricks.	17.129014212974162
A.	9.56954361575378
E.	10.594970405422256
has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.	12.389608171231282
Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.	10.177194487428094
E.’s leg.	18.726466621828596
He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.	13.513895066854747
Speaking about me.	4.589206041514797
What did he say?	13.54290662896258
What did he say?	13.54290662896258
What did he say about me?	12.05444424549495
Don’t ask.	18.678730907400503
—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.	9.806378798344115
Wait a moment.	7.6553119439012445
Let me say one thing.	9.375548281403859
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society.	11.132213310650128
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irish tongue.	10.42565149729118
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said: —You know Gerald Fitzgibbon.	13.477312193180957
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse.	16.072302638930246
—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J.	7.217675919550075
O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on the Trinity college estates commission.	13.67750065561592
—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s frock.	17.3372157083148
Go on.	5.797699311966299
Well?	18.814633242637697
—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator, full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the new movement.	10.16781036770251
It was then a new movement.	20.2692532578387
We were weak, therefore worthless.	10.244880185196383
He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.	10.383435403578627
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J.	4.920814056776214
O’Molloy: —Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed.	15.937327194660119
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall.	14.364902137427741
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it.	6.214359292814914
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) a dying man.	7.815590617647459
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J.	7.082918525192941
O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking.	14.89252978449501
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair.	7.977944844895361
Still seeking, he said: —When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.	10.378365466262498
Briefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.	17.929840854567892
His eyes bethought themselves once more.	7.542016337302538
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.	10.40897325703138
He began: _—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend.	9.081388049914631
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses._ His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech.	12.360320668618012
_And let our crooked smokes._ Noble words coming.	6.069489827398922
Look out.	5.540668548197516
Could you try your hand at it yourself?	13.186667312118866
_—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride.	12.371013400543047
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me._ FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted.	10.033813372038653
Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.	18.580737876980905
_—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our language?	13.00950746856131
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people.	9.825590556648766
You have no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe.	7.1361483624893465
You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity._ Nile.	11.704218462638742
Child, man, effigy.	14.1884658022638
By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple in combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.	6.557639658758239
_—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and mysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas.	6.590877769545997
Israel is weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms.	7.380552626783535
Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name._ A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech.	8.979977280742409
He lifted his voice above it boldly: _—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day.	9.888621586529304
OMINOUS—FOR HIM! J.	4.416815497315831
O’Molloy said not without regret: —And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.	10.695541327309884
—A—sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—previously— expectorated—demise, Lenehan added.	5.135317559752756
And with a great future behind him.	9.910815309740283
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase.	7.074331398285104
—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.	16.254283754410636
Gone with the wind.	13.613032527935356
Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings.	10.77588469228168
Miles of ears of porches.	9.249632451027578
The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds.	12.551425444555319
A people sheltered within his voice.	6.440431853120843
Dead noise.	10.03731883509593
Akasic records of all that ever anywhere wherever was.	8.694231440015146
Love and laud him: me no more.	8.057455102317993
I have money.	12.98098618751585
—Gentlemen, Stephen said.	3.454617071475205
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn?	13.863796219523035
—You take my breath away.	11.2247988362947
It is not perchance a French compliment?	16.345780936948056
Mr O’Madden Burke asked.	8.137446013359593
’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.	7.617562148108094
—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved.	10.280057484891817
All that are in favour say ay, Lenehan announced.	14.73812185425711
The contrary no.	6.60226806886257
I declare it carried.	10.492579528135202
To which particular boosing shed...?	5.880390748711029
My casting vote is: Mooney’s! He led the way, admonishing: —We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not?	9.25241860494907
Yes, we will not.	15.461223554899254
By no manner of means.	9.224849893839698
Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella: —Lay on, Macduff! —Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the shoulder.	13.391905910334998
Let us go.	9.611520239407309
Where are those blasted keys?	15.031987536701049
He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.	13.38624559892682
—Foot and mouth.	5.796457161236207
I know.	6.625264570568742
That’ll go in.	11.978939075477834
Where are they?	15.330116413827309
That’s all right.	7.784527266330787
He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.	10.846718555316963
LET US HOPE J.	4.128422497206696
O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen: —I hope you will live to see it published.	14.906346516061403
Myles, one moment.	13.002275013076986
He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.	9.156681725757176
—Come along, Stephen, the professor said.	6.813338314554494
That is fine, isn’t it?	7.963344515615416
It has the prophetic vision.	12.396623181866648
_Fuit Ilium!_ The sack of windy Troy.	10.164753661654808
Kingdoms of this world.	8.628001393223315
The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.	8.623879267067629
The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed out into the street, yelling: —Racing special! Dublin.	10.391588769448319
I have much, much to learn.	15.886357369782763
They turned to the left along Abbey street.	8.312724991282396
—I have a vision too, Stephen said.	9.271028416850076
—Yes?	20.046607644329956
the professor said, skipping to get into step.	14.069937751800289
Crawford will follow.	11.963825429107432
Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran: —Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN Dubliners.	10.58433142356212
—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty and fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.	8.354701536615822
—Where is that?	9.236505755220731
the professor asked.	8.038874898814724
—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.	3.8351020399261895
Damp night reeking of hungry dough.	6.846573949270318
Against the wall.	8.625291653249787
Face glistering tallow under her fustian shawl.	8.696712694916869
Frantic hearts.	11.404596047844995
Akasic records.	15.474216205246236
Quicker, darlint! On now.	5.3592193024833525
Dare it.	3.903055991727408
Let there be life.	5.833114182533669
—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.	14.397958849642027
They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox.	10.256543097280764
They shake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of a knife.	10.232164887629958
Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers.	10.366887477385799
They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.	10.502105764619193
—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.	4.2140394415422655
LIFE ON THE RAW —They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at the north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins, proprietress...	5.545094036665432
They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at the foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn.	13.196052635523559
They give two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits.	10.460451341596745
Glory be to God.	7.112573816816043
They had no idea it was that high.	13.076278195637252
Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe.	6.922212406571466
Anne Kearns has the lumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottleful from a passionist father.	10.412960664479124
Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.	9.302875122448711
—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice.	9.398503025475229
Vestal virgins.	9.957954844604965
I can see them.	9.489247958492136
What’s keeping our friend?	20.52044861228707
He turned.	9.935815215909654
A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all directions, yelling, their white papers fluttering.	8.163053624853909
Hard after them Myles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talking with J.	10.93020322833519
O’Molloy.	14.988249666447803
—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.	10.739717193108048
He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.	11.03454500519926
RETURN OF BLOOM —Yes, he said.	4.578833531897551
I see them.	7.758580959345922
Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices of the _Irish Catholic_ and _Dublin Penny Journal_, called: —Mr Crawford! A moment! —_Telegraph_! Racing special! —What is it?	9.818028562397426
Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.	11.84504209701626
A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face: —Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR —Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket.	9.99231457692017
I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.	6.706706916507148
He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says.	12.947257757495038
After he’ll see.	9.780345651824938
But he wants a par to call attention in the _Telegraph_ too, the Saturday pink.	14.587074106183481
And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the _Kilkenny People_.	14.094664173543933
I can have access to it in the national library.	14.36310027538716
House of keys, don’t you see?	9.846200385858598
His name is Keyes.	14.478707481189332
It’s a play on the name.	12.192283414064088
But he practically promised he’d give the renewal.	11.138124125332812
But he wants just a little puff.	19.04008684032119
What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?	22.013676508246412
K.M.A. —Will you tell him he can kiss my arse?	16.981638508732452
Myles Crawford said throwing out his arm for emphasis.	12.167486578391319
Tell him that straight from the stable.	18.09444352531707
A bit nervy.	15.204438493688993
Look out for squalls.	16.99949246037612
All off for a drink.	10.663591262044807
Arm in arm.	7.363165645043609
Lenehan’s yachting cap on the cadge beyond.	19.04798156807898
Usual blarney.	14.833002552262101
Wonder is that young Dedalus the moving spirit.	10.414292372637997
Has a good pair of boots on him today.	13.914741208152366
Last time I saw him he had his heels on view.	13.495673216833328
Been walking in muck somewhere.	6.787668591006206
Careless chap.	8.696732028700477
What was he doing in Irishtown?	15.306336572968563
—Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I suppose it’s worth a short par.	13.413975966153405
He’d give the ad, I think.	11.752637607096341
I’ll tell him...	5.1146934047784995
K.M.R.I.A. —He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his shoulder.	9.333919109665459
Any time he likes, tell him.	6.177265027083529
While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on jerkily.	10.883376405890523
RAISING THE WIND —_Nulla bona_, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin.	8.529334143621913
I’m up to here.	10.666434146869632
I’ve been through the hoop myself.	14.188414134299778
I was looking for a fellow to back a bill for me no later than last week.	15.128733016414003
Sorry, Jack.	11.370763185804162
You must take the will for the deed.	17.344496314834036
With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.	16.20668507063215
O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently.	16.723812827839158
They caught up on the others and walked abreast.	13.247269253739269
—When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.	10.267794371237194
—Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford.	9.640215517333147
Two old Dublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.	12.896703827062721
SOME COLUMN!—THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID —That’s new, Myles Crawford said.	6.402728821851868
That’s copy.	25.987021038281068
Out for the waxies’ Dargle.	14.12176622814776
Two old trickies, what?	8.080023277744552
—But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on.	10.115018207506944
They see the roofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome, Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s.	6.19561285208135
But it makes them giddy to look so they pull up their skirts...	7.487105577968122
No poetic licence.	9.806260385174442
We’re in the archdiocese here.	11.143081053547556
—And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue of the onehandled adulterer.	15.417809788000788
—Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried.	7.465591080343348
I like that.	5.434640172953613
I see the idea.	11.226259754746657
DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF —It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too tired to look up or down or to speak.	8.7716330376501
They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.	9.441360844179387
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close.	12.031908032320942
Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.	6.397304988276063
—Finished?	17.17289249749927
Myles Crawford said.	3.6998611883181507
So long as they do no worse.	12.80305229239007
SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS.	6.103613581201872
SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.	10.53625214251107
ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.	7.917006161605888
—You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist.	13.81972402511815
It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer against others or against himself.	8.845244509608294
He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman.	20.325974252478222
And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.	10.948354901645208
Poor Penelope.	11.308115195751736
Penelope Rich.	15.69326635837007
They made ready to cross O’Connell street.	8.203954875240544
HELLO THERE, CENTRAL! At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit.	6.1634003530226265
Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.	4.051336584260879
WHAT?—AND LIKEWISE—WHERE?	8.209135898164968
—But what do you call it?	11.377153877627311
Myles Crawford asked.	9.027708403140668
Where did they get the plums?	20.310393292264333
VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE.	9.198960774010084
SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.	7.447554525104425
—Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to reflect.	12.560821864352784
Call it, let me see.	9.529438068333395
Call it: _deus nobis hæc otia fecit._ —No, Stephen said.	6.340553197151889

Mantailored with selfcovered buttons.	7.175026440528101
As if that.	5.958202734834087
Old Goodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff.	11.8168944202507
Flies’ picnic too.	4.57515674342756
Never put a dress on her back like it.	8.167572053389199
Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips.	11.03794571694895
Just beginning to plump it out well.	10.167119863433316
Rabbitpie we had that day.	8.771806958359315
People looking after her.	5.394077843064721
Happier then.	6.314844812922283
Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.	13.37048951230794

Milly’s tubbing night.	13.283069593874908
American soap I bought: elderflower.	10.184742808167623
Cosy smell of her bathwater.	20.559125106635936
Funny she looked soaped all over.	5.9363393839111795
Shapely too.	4.66219583534958
Now photography.	14.833002552262101
Poor papa’s daguerreotype atelier he told me of.	9.904414042302669
Hereditary taste.	12.6987856960012
Stream of life.	5.646671179269495
What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed?	15.510957590846987
Weak eyes, woman.	9.629755368046665
Stopped in Citron’s saint Kevin’s parade.	15.01203786735781
Pen something.	7.819127799593088
Pendennis?	32.172570290454246
My memory is getting.	11.034709202375653
Pen ...?	7.099253858371814
Of course it’s years ago.	11.114846394819592
Noise of the trams probably.	14.343170150799027
Well, if he couldn’t remember the dayfather’s name that he sees every day.	15.14837138511461
Bartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then.	9.784244155998456
Seeing her home after practice.	10.575785275024801
Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache.	12.706045164231837
Gave her that song _Winds that blow from the south_.	12.313946616769465
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house.	11.447091351928231
He and I behind.	11.653889858804634
Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings.	16.39613627105003
Lucky it didn’t.	5.658110868175317
Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her.	9.39194198344818
Professor Goodwin linking her in front.	10.632696505012
Shaky on his pins, poor old sot.	15.446176725358036

Positively last appearance on any stage.	9.276227332806554

Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust.	8.509887575052176
Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin.	9.492267950100752
She did get flushed in the wind.	10.56559515287254
Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked.	9.480556480956196
And the mulled rum.	16.137430919110113
Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.	12.130780861363252
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed.	8.04055186592429
Always warm from her.	4.919532555590357
Always liked to let her self out.	7.63322928819419
Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins.	9.323914429439736
Milly tucked up in beddyhouse.	14.713760576645878
That was the night...	4.450945127756903
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?	13.135692221793205
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?	18.456978296964106
—No use complaining.	21.698867153031323
How is Molly those times?	12.893483467865337
Haven’t seen her for ages.	14.61121875747706
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily.	13.72525870610625
Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.	10.123976089729764
—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?	9.87194275146796
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
In a photographer’s there.	8.909494173539056
Getting on like a house on fire.	11.015068268604102
How are all your charges?	20.722334894131617
—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.	11.329337474555388
How many has she?	12.598326038684487
No other in sight.	11.0766321951098
You have no...	3.8733990111710184
—No, Mr Bloom said.	5.2058252999005825
I have just come from a funeral.	17.009626771441816
Going to crop up all day, I foresee.	16.82184997775477
Who’s dead, when and what did he die of?	16.517327347793724
Turn up like a bad penny.	15.244536216659704
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said.	9.751027918921785
I hope it wasn’t any near relation.	10.698134989522698
May as well get her sympathy.	12.333484145632868
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said.	4.879967194201119
An old friend of mine.	9.674599584886659
He died quite suddenly, poor fellow.	8.743409593442642
Funeral was this morning.	6.6893763959263834
Your funeral’s tomorrow While you’re coming through the rye.	14.254302612446178
Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...	2.465672775996555
—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.	12.891737014578027
Now that’s quite enough about that.	9.15880135677964
Just: quietly: husband.	7.252183651446473
—And your lord and master?	16.65230849677274
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes.	8.484668728120212
Hasn’t lost them anyhow.	10.311901188719888
—O, don’t be talking! she said.	7.250779006294876
He’s a caution to rattlesnakes.	11.588912628898152
He’s in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel.	15.670257079293343
He has me heartscalded.	15.660867259447157
Wait till I show you.	6.707506145210314
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison’s.	4.482649912714701
The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet.	11.205252369621926
Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they’d taste it with the hot tea.	10.387227910117657
Or is it from her?	15.21429893374398
A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes.	11.426325232892296
Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way.	4.969412011128586
Pleasure or pain is it?	5.688887296161797
Penny dinner.	11.460465231628643
Knife and fork chained to the table.	8.007528823857168
Opening her handbag, chipped leather.	7.4252678111295625
Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram.	18.69834326398345
Rummaging.	32.172570290454246
Open.	32.172570290454246
Money.	32.172570290454246
Please take one.	5.80433808007571
Devils if they lose sixpence.	11.460315354626012
Husband barging.	14.509135749322695
Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday?	14.02087182465781
Are you feeding your little brother’s family?	18.30230630709335
Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle.	9.570841516697174
Pastille that was fell.	14.408560421893371
What is she?...	4.223704696695744
—There must be a new moon out, she said.	9.299972363180173
He’s always bad then.	10.696137745885325
Do you know what he did last night?	18.185123680652737
Her hand ceased to rummage.	11.982511850625965
Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.	8.514601820691166
—What?	12.016783147492532
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
Let her speak.	10.042276632146923
Look straight in her eyes.	6.716779451176337
I believe you.	6.48884909141273
Trust me.	4.321040784203081
—Woke me up in the night, she said.	6.439325959642782
Dream he had, a nightmare.	15.999287213591957
Indiges.	32.172570290454246
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.	6.806054819152576
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.	16.02947794326778
—Read that, she said.	4.9726233881762365
He got it this morning.	8.653017297490493
—What is it?	8.031263818381309
Mr Bloom asked, taking the card.	14.991171415889111
U.	12.767692980896975
P.?	14.182378610867087
—U.	7.289036802065507
p: up, she said.	5.3025238562865775
Someone taking a rise out of him.	6.135618247661795
It’s a great shame for them whoever he is.	10.746023124251563
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.	5.38078878056619
She took back the card, sighing.	10.904110175652628
—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office.	16.389487973152438
He’s going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.	11.910909351087664
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.	9.12993703844947
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching.	12.974382805747462
Seen its best days.	6.323186090604507
Wispish hair over her ears.	9.789990388414829
And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it.	5.921236597947317
Shabby genteel.	14.509135749322695
She used to be a tasty dresser.	13.339840976107896
Lines round her mouth.	8.166647951063915
Only a year or so older than Molly.	10.704094482641455
See the eye that woman gave her, passing.	12.382631859805722
Cruel.	25.535385961793953
The unfair sex.	9.458595683788529
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.	13.384913351348818
Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny.	8.809523962468996
I’m hungry too.	9.38063848490626
Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.	10.474935577276677
Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior.	6.893346944341329
Josie Powell that was.	5.820155930301514
In Luke Doyle’s long ago.	9.133426575619225
Dolphin’s Barn, the charades.	21.871176872928512
U.	12.767692980896975
p: up.	4.887050564640962
Change the subject.	11.08052280684756
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy?	18.478381183811
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
—Mina Purefoy?	16.779143353290227
she said.	3.3050219522328192
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking.	12.124217047703576
Playgoers’ Club.	12.265226704433895
Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke.	16.840428466074265
Did I pull the chain?	13.743703553332761
The last act.	12.847977486511894
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it.	11.98076081158309
She’s in the lying-in hospital in Holles street.	8.436502284974017
Dr Horne got her in.	5.433907356441355
She’s three days bad now.	7.890571981805227
—O, Mr Bloom said.	5.563184495521673
I’m sorry to hear that.	8.17154551660692
—Yes, Mrs Breen said.	7.3864187736770495
And a houseful of kids at home.	7.099218003431209
It’s a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.	10.990926895543158
—O, Mr Bloom said.	5.563184495521673
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news.	7.076203032133675
His tongue clacked in compassion.	8.441443389503986
Dth! Dth! —I’m sorry to hear that, he said.	6.876830721194093
Poor thing! Three days! That’s terrible for her.	8.899852617863301
Mrs Breen nodded.	13.278229005052815
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...	7.435032858416509
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her: —Mind! Let this man pass.	10.385998276483416
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass.	12.058758416842707
Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head.	8.053491213811911
From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.	14.017887559549049
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said.	5.283613012969748
He always walks outside the lampposts.	9.659540968278247
Watch! —Who is he if it’s a fair question?	18.24840410687166
Mrs Breen asked.	7.800891713602703
Is he dotty?	22.535540211947957
—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling.	9.433950809919736
Watch! —He has enough of them, she said.	9.653326598823073
Denis will be like that one of these days.	13.142193823015319
She broke off suddenly.	9.615471092132918
—There he is, she said.	5.686172642976559
I must go after him.	8.494077602151421
Goodbye.	32.172570290454246
Remember me to Molly, won’t you?	9.675490212822659
—I will, Mr Bloom said.	7.176643278583287
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts.	10.177993727707996
Blown in from the bay.	15.125003143401388
Like old times.	7.594006499481721
He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.	9.5090970085157
Meshuggah.	32.172570290454246
Off his chump.	11.563768904404501
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat.	12.705993094663889
Going the two days.	11.389547391051092
Watch him! Out he goes again.	9.274859388304588
One way of getting on in the world.	10.03716215584537
And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds.	12.604848551421416
Hard time she must have with him.	6.089220082922908
U.	12.767692980896975

Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything.	14.438642364089247
His oyster eyes staring at the postcard.	14.37931033744911
Be a feast for the gods.	13.744847215615971

The tentacles...	2.3608030459348393
They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone.	17.622074744026012

Initials perhaps.	6.814204367651865
Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire.	6.429462519925842
What was he saying?	18.330958502399465
The ends of the world with a Scotch accent.	12.703928347082078
Tentacles: octopus.	11.843092642970625
Something occult: symbolism.	9.127651993102257
Holding forth.	11.51620488139059
She’s taking it all in.	11.120898945659786

Only weggebobbles and fruit.	7.083819116596593
Don’t eat a beefsteak.	14.71829043423688
If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity.	11.991997972269944
They say it’s healthier.	23.91315515080475
Windandwatery though.	9.011105763964188
Tried it.	3.903055991727408
Keep you on the run all day.	10.026485502023677
Dreams all night.	5.988430800385003
Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak?	18.555875948501868
Nutarians.	32.172570290454246
Fruitarians.	32.172570290454246
To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak.	12.887549520536853
Absurd.	32.172570290454246
Salty too.	4.66219583534958
They cook in soda.	9.485743245521798
Keep you sitting by the tap all night.	8.668922341310216
Her stockings are loose over her ankles.	11.156806954249456
I detest that: so tasteless.	10.926026705425418
Those literary etherial people they are all.	6.288305215530911
Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic.	7.820823652686895
Esthetes they are.	6.870247176129313
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.	13.215294727029075
For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn’t squeeze a line of poetry out of him.	7.904236152523581
Don’t know what poetry is even.	14.580323235719876
Must be in a certain mood.	20.986493801801334
The dreamy cloudy gull Waves o’er the waters dull.	6.416957355818236
He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses.	8.501756881769824
Or will I drop into old Harris’s and have a chat with young Sinclair?	9.284143795230106
Wellmannered fellow.	8.12757792990543
Probably at his lunch.	16.990202100537207
Must get those old glasses of mine set right.	8.265879426781146
Goerz lenses six guineas.	7.686684756036451

Sell on easy terms to capture trade.	6.352707832334299
Undercutting.	32.172570290454246
Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office.	12.831170768000359
Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms.	10.55571438126572
What do they be thinking about?	12.217916632207727
Women too.	4.66219583534958
Incredible.	32.172570290454246
Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer’s daughter’s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction.	13.165899629905121
Unclaimed money too.	4.786012369300462
There’s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.	12.150389083554375
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides.	16.37850433779279
Can’t see it.	6.9886842195316445
If you imagine it’s there you can almost see it.	10.95776781302958
Can’t see it.	6.9886842195316445
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm’s length towards the sun.	12.609089325557127
Wanted to try that often.	11.864978332635712
Yes: completely.	12.491917132666769
The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk.	16.162995307245602
Must be the focus where the rays cross.	10.431862434348028
If I had black glasses.	13.320594524259636
Interesting.	32.172570290454246
There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west.	11.701847506917726
Looking up from the back garden.	13.492831057633637
Terrific explosions they are.	5.917244099455636
There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.	6.247803520550915
Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time.	9.14065604688182

Cap in hand goes through the land.	10.905493205977917
Not go in and blurt out what you know you’re not to: what’s parallax?	15.458401745085963
Show this gentleman the door.	5.582408951302241
Ah. His hand fell to his side again.	11.257598940044613
Never know anything about it.	5.933647273872608
Waste of time.	5.953132056458378

The moon.	7.7119290105936695
Must be a new moon out, she said.	8.157255976649749

He went on by la maison Claire.	12.179139567086171
The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon.	11.291474067133711
Walking down by the Tolka.	16.86863117431623
Not bad for a Fairview moon.	10.649538897692235
She was humming.	21.16539134127209
He other side of her.	5.382018837757442

On his annual bend, M’Coy said.	4.670109726413094

Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.	13.21398546747152
Thought so.	7.001174124681293
Sloping into the Empire.	19.239446884797257
Gone.	17.705247751504768
Plain soda would do him good.	9.159210308994144
Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen’s.	4.549727456894134

Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts.	9.207475760925606
Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath.	7.25858867028785
More power, Pat.	9.214767069448603
Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke.	5.8319237387760605
Take off that white hat.	8.923518760363422

Where is he now?	12.314729249087208
Beggar somewhere.	7.472160030426017
The harp that once did starve us all.	5.70728278089805
I was happier then.	12.742091845695914
Or was that I?	12.462489546933535
Or am I now I?	11.854790238148636
Twentyeight I was.	5.918974960194281
She twentythree.	14.509135749322695
Could never like it again after Rudy.	10.478676823200987
Can’t bring back time.	9.43583034010279
Like holding water in your hand.	6.931082172563489
Would you go back to then?	18.139137471676662
Would you?	9.604530037531351
Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?	10.908217099894756
Wants to sew on buttons for me.	4.798512047416174
I must answer.	13.077362078502148

Cascades of ribbons.	11.843477303307884
Flimsy China silks.	11.509283989920098
A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood.	5.620887126421773
The huguenots brought that here.	4.774217295092525

He bared slightly his left forearm.	10.662816080749254
Scrape: nearly gone.	6.061316405455918
Not today anyhow.	6.857904377632856
Must go back for that lotion.	14.849655172324697
For her birthday perhaps.	5.906996344383708
Junejulyaugseptember eighth.	14.833002552262101
Nearly three months off.	6.530322044743262
Then she mightn’t like it.	6.628834305121948
Women won’t pick up pins.	14.345634056029194
Say it cuts lo.	10.809863463872682
Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.	4.645807383769535
Useless to go back.	9.286483641340121
Had to be.	8.373733591633721

Wealth of the world.	8.67512538476046
A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain.	10.352245192147844
His brain yielded.	11.767409778394876
Perfume of embraces all him assailed.	7.875295455803595
With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.	9.204691864604536
Duke street.	5.720898661579612
Here we are.	6.900148303367386

The Burton.	12.570867676935075
Feel better then.	6.712472960140055
He turned Combridge’s corner, still pursued.	17.43889460505013
Jingling, hoofthuds.	12.175197183649477
Perfumed bodies, warm, full.	7.5485600578412875
All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.	7.102966111384797
—Jack, love! —Darling! —Kiss me, Reggy! —My boy! —Love! His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant.	14.31180776263965
Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens.	6.036221460494722
See the animals feed.	11.794747637306243
Men, men, men.	8.196603377215824
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches.	8.141510280309575
A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin.	8.668918902578572
New set of microbes.	11.421094105066478
A man with an infant’s saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet.	13.341663657555891
Chump chop from the grill.	15.89489173564491
Bolting to get it over.	9.341661417453166
Sad booser’s eyes.	7.432353789147297
Bitten off more than he can chew.	14.161157986612565
Am I like that?	11.546146847020303
See ourselves as others see us.	5.877680711600666
Hungry man is an angry man.	8.056609999242113
Working tooth and jaw.	9.660214625503416
Don’t! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne.	13.582519833237479
Wonder what he was eating.	24.035845237323475
Something galoptious.	14.509135749322695
Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity.	16.22609850633246
Couldn’t swallow it all however.	16.587009760650197
—Roast beef and cabbage.	8.149302045407858
—One stew.	12.893473014015548
Smells of men.	6.996762677051211
Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men’s beery piss, the stale of ferment.	7.954874381122168
His gorge rose.	6.487039237560257
Couldn’t eat a morsel here.	8.12639080880314
Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles.	9.18992495923388
Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud.	8.350506379262246

Look on this picture then on that.	5.602914856077445
Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread.	6.167056725281876
Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.	11.950126705030609
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.	7.008324515991087
—Two stouts here.	6.289023439330946
—One corned and cabbage.	8.466687788310251
That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it.	6.020783988809099
Good stroke.	12.531268249602594
Give me the fidgets to look.	8.533963479743093
Safer to eat from his three hands.	10.63202502292968
Tear it limb from limb.	8.42215617237795
Second nature to him.	4.7624967807987355
Born with a silver knife in his mouth.	13.646516588786774
That’s witty, I think.	13.4080646279376
Or no.	7.825388444760924
Silver means born rich.	9.064878647104935
Born with a knife.	16.860908877243666
But then the allusion is lost.	9.857629037947051
An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates.	7.072107151319234
Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard.	13.699847711686488

Did you, faith?	28.826411576183055
Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips.	11.1345870278645
His eyes said: —Not here.	11.228903439527196
Don’t see him.	7.736981675675562

Davy Byrne said...	2.890277476422444
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.	12.353622664128926

Ay. He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.	14.70693786669649
—Ay, he said, sighing.	12.486060395883182
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh.	11.954361765470402
Nosey numbskull.	14.509135749322695
Will I tell him that horse Lenehan?	17.48780848089568
He knows already.	14.00824067982348
Better let him forget.	13.45956305519938
Go and lose more.	7.228718592090949

O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away.	8.627252157455818
Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.	8.29390403950748

Keeper won’t see.	6.680308782167276
Bend down let something fall see if she.	7.035902770355206
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do.	14.20431955328169
A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.	9.131178017917733
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book: —What is this he is?	14.34148985409637
Isn’t he in the insurance line?	17.111673878137935
—He’s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said.	7.934706113167099
He does canvassing for the _Freeman._ —I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said.	9.024808005440942
Is he in trouble?	15.630405490839394
—Trouble?	17.96943513961382
Nosey Flynn said.	3.502623779450091
Why?	12.512270304170855
—I noticed he was in mourning.	17.981341449403914
—Was he?	9.966490662751502
Nosey Flynn said.	3.502623779450091
So he was, faith.	10.067384784540668
I asked him how was all at home.	10.747662879545128
You’re right, by God.	12.54446563037394
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way.	10.853145182287282
It only brings it up fresh in their minds.	14.126644882203488
—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said.	6.911001002679516
I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half.	13.283088080275915
She’s well nourished, I tell you.	9.409492088536386
Plovers on toast.	10.327919031192598
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.	8.16392511775112
—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up.	11.070169459895888
You can make bacon of that.	7.074464627333344
—How so?	13.295764727969926
Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.	13.91069492078561
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers.	8.820500324634493
He winked.	12.570867676935075
—He’s in the craft, he said.	7.191941503021371
—Do you tell me so?	15.488901003155764
Davy Byrne said.	3.615370712880238
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said.	5.36935502352439
Ancient free and accepted order.	9.289082308508126
Light, life and love, by God.	10.01394460681615
They give him a leg up.	8.554120233879454
I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.	14.48305057166219
—Is that a fact?	11.857896236260586
—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said.	7.3290315040857505
They stick to you when you’re down.	9.116872904621363
But they’re as close as damn it.	6.456521275690914
By God they did right to keep the women out of it.	8.999547468383158
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one: —Iiiiiichaaaaaaach! —There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing.	15.98593050828611
But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason.	11.033822517372265
That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.	12.534799819818558
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes: —And is that a fact?	9.830326666797855
Decent quiet man he is.	5.722603789549135
I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.	14.507764816260323
—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly.	12.351373118731596
Didn’t you see him look at his watch?	21.364219181483456
Ah, you weren’t there.	11.957333544243662
If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe.	19.368220459591168
Declare to God he does.	10.056601151527296
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said.	7.384172253754763
He’s a safe man, I’d say.	11.367754532188176
—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up.	9.049180437913606
He’s been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow.	10.164242506865266
Give the devil his due.	11.609629619411042
O, Bloom has his good points.	16.762365297696018
But there’s one thing he’ll never do.	11.827496613350153
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.	8.58115085222797
—I know, Davy Byrne said.	6.981643578646238
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.	5.042960154573422
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in.	6.366853875281766
Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.	13.377117534739586
—Day, Mr Byrne.	15.125020594731424
—Day, gentlemen.	7.767883673457942
They paused at the counter.	11.292173455542569
—Who’s standing?	22.837571238250355
—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.	9.958165417742496
—Well, what’ll it be?	14.579833288690725
—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.	8.314268458513453
—How much?	19.252420845685748
Paddy Leonard cried.	8.974202198497514
Since when, for God’ sake?	18.17024141624391
What’s yours, Tom?	23.31493102225767
—How is the main drainage?	21.346420159906867
Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.	16.715554005209114
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.	11.136020195268614
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne?	16.765877415587745
he said.	3.3900725752648877
—Certainly, sir.	5.056872575176414
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.	11.128511709610736
—Lord love a duck, he said.	4.57109684623241
Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.	9.856823944054621
He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup.	13.058616607366103
A dead snip.	13.253204467686803
—Zinfandel is it?	5.794519574510289
Nosey Flynn asked.	8.12330699498783
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.	9.104525653933365
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.	14.373321938518933
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.	4.925991308118733
—Is it Zinfandel?	20.198296197773672
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked.	9.912517224201546
I’m going to plunge five bob on my own.	11.93514344854246
—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said.	8.195209049046433
Who gave it to you?	8.341214991459797
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.	12.274771175826082
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.	4.715411698875109
The others turned.	8.994297815328993
—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.	12.00043474829153
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn.	9.415078912362816
Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...	7.3788577467653855
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said.	5.601853191508908
A suckingbottle for the baby.	12.64783673934948
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth.	16.238482680602143
Something green it would have to be: spinach, say.	7.928972464919762
Then with those Röntgen rays searchlight you could.	7.4205288787470245
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest.	9.354848300318544
Surfeit.	32.172570290454246
Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents.	6.63483954244742
First sweet then savoury.	10.058968725229878
Mr Bloom coasted warily.	20.506049616965548
Ruminants.	32.172570290454246
His second course.	6.925246349307537
Their upper jaw they move.	8.067458315938742
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?	14.087613311814575
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth.	10.364241485796697
Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free.	12.15878471719421
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars: Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M’invitasti.	9.67784527532832
Feel better.	8.157928963369484
Burgundy.	22.307214335724723
Good pick me up.	5.001243575800267
Who distilled first?	11.338487446002004
Some chap in the blues.	21.856070543821026
That _Kilkenny People_ in the national library now I must.	10.671744567294503
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts.	8.781258747080662
They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes.	9.268212222571472
But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show.	13.294825910482398
Science.	25.535385961793953
—_A cenar teco._ What does that _teco_ mean?	7.924665844204665
Tonight perhaps.	6.814204367651865
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.	9.10438748338379
Doesn’t go properly.	19.163793922854463

If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen.	15.485895691344053
Five guineas about.	7.157693679223477
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.	11.218406271641992

Today.	20.267449269082853
Not think.	7.131692258253128
Tour the south then.	7.854362303934879
What about English wateringplaces?	16.651545702248455
Brighton, Margate.	12.479061522578819
Piers by moonlight.	12.371387992018937
Her voice floating out.	5.954361071578812
Those lovely seaside girls.	7.177807120093829
Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle.	7.161907484727686
Handy man wants job.	6.788966530212086
Small wages.	14.509135749322695
Will eat anything.	7.84785061100653
Mr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore.	15.827762625327127
_Why I left the church of Rome?	11.863367739461417
Birds’ Nest._ Women run him.	4.951834661730902
They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.	13.001334627189792
Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews.	14.353127012019439
Same bait.	14.833002552262101
Why we left the church of Rome.	9.412030572504467
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane.	11.250490123956732
No tram in sight.	7.850861116410037
Wants to cross.	11.465594341160937
—Do you want to cross?	17.127222848042177
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
His wallface frowned weakly.	7.5780638585686875
He moved his head uncertainly.	20.271910881533405
—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said.	6.86455613065329
Molesworth street is opposite.	8.763444411120364
Do you want to cross?	21.561349399495775
There’s nothing in the way.	12.284455292824436
The cane moved out trembling to the left.	7.494892227554664
Mr Bloom’s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s.	8.104925516036616
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was.	7.912440550385126
Horse drooping.	15.045831905306336
Slaking his drouth.	9.8261377478545
—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving.	12.539418504364592
I’ll see you across.	15.233865831541685
Do you want to go to Molesworth street?	19.53340038254322
—Yes, the stripling answered.	10.411486001825448
South Frederick street.	5.156023245868003
—Come, Mr Bloom said.	5.39463894771281
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.	8.717035716717108
Say something to him.	5.729396803609368
Better not do the condescending.	14.008532776224067
They mistrust what you tell them.	7.65982082931454
Pass a common remark.	7.72036109107625
—The rain kept off.	9.80911072369478
No answer.	8.084572888842725
Stains on his coat.	15.544204302328895
Slobbers his food, I suppose.	8.804077628979636
Tastes all different for him.	4.284880976295735
Have to be spoonfed first.	12.978902185510004
Like a child’s hand, his hand.	11.072404776750275
Like Milly’s was.	6.226474343526732
Sensitive.	32.172570290454246
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand.	7.607393864936358
Wonder if he has a name.	12.40782541709743
Van.	32.172570290454246
Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired drudge get his doze.	10.684321219152956
That’s right.	9.635533038319489
Clear.	32.172570290454246
Behind a bull: in front of a horse.	11.808644075976225
—Thanks, sir.	6.107353472130071
Knows I’m a man.	7.411470502775474
Voice.	32.172570290454246
—Right now?	10.354563519780033
First turn to the left.	9.756354421242639
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.	9.334651433825638
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed.	13.384092508406845
Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?	11.562013061312006
Must have felt it.	6.284802877824315
See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume.	13.93319686739562
Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark.	9.30292150583873
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed.	12.101020506166133
Feel a gap.	12.38365662617175
Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones.	10.989970244412051
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn’t that cane?	14.67508826863992
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.	12.819240648968835
Penrose! That was that chap’s name.	11.943125850110741
Look at all the things they can learn to do.	12.992419219775423
Read with their fingers.	11.339219018184856
Tune pianos.	14.833002552262101
Or we are surprised they have any brains.	13.590725639070802
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.	8.528170281288066
Of course the other senses are more.	10.682601844679352
Embroider.	32.172570290454246
Plait baskets.	14.833002552262101
People ought to help.	15.907293798120584
Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday.	18.055931310090816
Hates sewing.	14.509135749322695
Might take an objection.	12.522649904588565
Dark men they call them.	5.934960606621642
Smells on all sides, bunched together.	6.346171092156024
Each street different smell.	7.779124838933849
Each person too.	4.620596782329979
Then the spring, the summer: smells.	13.917895215043766
Tastes?	32.172570290454246
They say you can’t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head.	12.545114255954202
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.	11.64665103674204
And with a woman, for instance.	13.94487788658662
More shameless not seeing.	9.811225469883636
That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air.	6.9982051721607395
Look at me.	6.8728377819715405
I have them all on.	9.904272648837809
Must be strange not to see her.	10.229337064565627
Kind of a form in his mind’s eye.	15.283133577018946
The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves.	13.916603325199276
His hands on her hair, for instance.	14.800741572702043
Say it was black, for instance.	14.590644849126942
Good.	20.267449269082853
We call it black.	11.660475345532982
Then passing over her white skin.	10.348251707317377
Different feel perhaps.	6.301754963064289
Feeling of white.	8.28606694291175
Postoffice.	32.172570290454246
Must answer.	7.73662163014333
Fag today.	6.468988669688199
Accept my little present.	9.074798637988918
Stationer’s just here too.	8.72291653420077
Think over it.	3.9929377614325547
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears.	10.024859877544491
Again.	20.267449269082853
Fibres of fine fine straw.	9.39745695169142
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek.	11.604294350985633
Downy hair there too.	5.299962373940903
Not smooth enough.	7.768939352940849
The belly is the smoothest.	16.320504355674576
No-one about.	9.017134746206178
There he goes into Frederick street.	7.66581802909924
Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano.	9.781207232092608
Might be settling my braces.	10.936294782888705
Walking by Doran’s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly.	12.567516087948073
But I know it’s whitey yellow.	19.54773608722694
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.	6.926157581384931
Poor fellow! Quite a boy.	7.5594953545341
Terrible.	32.172570290454246
Really terrible.	15.148661575930285
What dreams would he have, not seeing?	15.062178184193787
Life a dream for him.	4.913607911465331
Where is the justice being born that way?	13.41375631774953
All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York.	6.742281245202074
Holocaust.	32.172570290454246
Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.	8.0469795144732
Dear, dear, dear.	9.43588104999677
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons’ hall.	8.811998704964614
After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace.	9.743834942415594
Old legal cronies cracking a magnum.	7.53575489404542
Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school.	12.139343181890458
I sentenced him to ten years.	9.233338590929582
I suppose he’d turn up his nose at that stuff I drank.	15.024916469094672
Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle.	13.043980252745369
Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder’s court.	15.45604312951066
Wellmeaning old man.	5.6960036971331265
Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime.	5.994998785151603
Sends them to the rightabout.	18.387869437754432
The devil on moneylenders.	11.584586208345675

What about going out there: Ballsbridge.	16.39122885019508
Drop in on Keyes.	12.135805216464806
No use sticking to him like a leech.	17.716547979842694
Wear out my welcome.	7.426299791295063
Sure to know someone on the gate.	15.355643030121366
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street.	11.143361058678662
First I must.	11.697585112392224

It is.	5.625548601691804
It is.	5.625548601691804
His heart quopped softly.	7.606885791516482
To the right.	9.768582463966844
Museum.	25.535385961793953
Goddesses.	32.172570290454246
He swerved to the right.	7.3399589916901515
Is it?	9.32883387949522
Almost certain.	15.180184254452517
Won’t look.	12.938480207100403
Wine in my face.	9.255144648555886
Why did I?	12.385036284110578
Too heady.	14.509135749322695
Yes, it is.	7.9013956148843025
The walk.	8.704681084753679
Not see.	5.463510164118329
Get on.	5.3851450255894875
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.	8.941898436112819
Handsome building.	15.045831905306336
Sir Thomas Deane designed.	10.448403729929472
Not following me?	8.569619269741457
Didn’t see me perhaps.	11.540917074380713
Light in his eyes.	7.935346311506526
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs.	13.223782463926602
Cold statues: quiet there.	5.3302912049609885
Safe in a minute.	15.355246580686378
No. Didn’t see me.	9.698480929121978
After two.	8.329744170028597
Just at the gate.	14.724006478653408
My heart! His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone.	8.058259792685039
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.	14.088447268923579
Look for something I.	5.72419738087075
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim.	9.126998523770974
Where did I?	10.931924435123824
Busy looking.	8.998814606474616
He thrust back quick Agendath.	9.853643901636161
Afternoon she said.	3.4474711839499714
I am looking for that.	9.711721065972684

Where?	14.052664453048125
Hurry.	25.535385961793953
Walk quietly.	8.90469469939437
Moment more.	6.573328550076725
My heart.	7.677111201269118
His hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap lotion have to call tepid paper stuck.	12.398021168797356
Ah soap there I yes.	6.6286071079142665

A hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in real life.	5.644089733042917
He came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.	9.611281901004318
A noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck.	9.75847877526773

True in the larger analysis.	22.28810003032649
Twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off.	4.819171488330481
Bald, most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendant’s words: heard them: and was gone.	12.28434590831231

—All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his shadow.	8.557299571640646

Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.	18.03327726041679
—And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said.	8.872970652690064
One can see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.	12.134309245096384

—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and undramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.	9.87940894188195
John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth: —Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato.	9.272531039337425

Space: what you damn well have to see.	10.868600126612382
Through spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow.	8.402889553662716
Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to the past.	12.144737365869963
Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.	10.722552483914162
—Haines is gone, he said.	4.896013713813424
—Is he?	11.265480306039917
—I was showing him Jubainville’s book.	15.595011213464785
He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t you know, about Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht._ I couldn’t bring him in to hear the discussion.	12.689987779705064
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.	8.10468603085922
Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick To greet the callous public.	7.404522703850382
Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish In lean unlovely English.	8.552804529474873
—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.	17.279444977488616
We feel in England.	8.813397207244083
Penitent thief.	15.009292486789496
Gone.	17.705247751504768
I smoked his baccy.	9.322994411503998
Green twinkling stone.	8.100226150645442
An emerald set in the ring of the sea.	10.855935834573184
—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of Russell warned occultly.	9.139079775932325
For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother.	11.193844730732472
The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichall song.	10.73268508578423
France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.	10.524734715334892
From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.	7.5575546218309135
—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris.	8.458156066843552
The one about _Hamlet._ He says: _il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même_, don’t you know, _reading the book of himself_.	6.685340783692073
He describes _Hamlet_ given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.	10.050109259418791
They advertised it.	3.7329805859928933
His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.	5.494657287180996
_Hamlet ou Le Distrait Pièce de Shakespeare_ He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown: —_Pièce de Shakespeare_, don’t you know.	7.070040783019448
It’s so French.	15.657292815405933
_Hamlet ou_...	2.3608030459348393
—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.	17.845714423400036
John Eglinton laughed.	13.928653210513273
—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said.	7.245444041702556
Excellent people, no doubt, but distressingly shortsighted in some matters.	11.686363964237389
—A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said.	8.881400659944598
Not for nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms.	9.48305105094863
Our Father who art in purgatory.	9.450439422134261
Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot.	9.568465940183966
The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.	10.830011720922405
Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.	6.975089003884076
Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none But we had spared...	4.191154717534857
Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp.	9.231650555811582
The devil and the deep sea.	11.967770546772627
—He will have it that _Hamlet_ is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr Best’s behoof.	17.07356843278759
Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep.	11.265428110980148
List! List! O List! My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.	9.737032369529572
If thou didst ever...	3.122710302220635
—What is a ghost?	21.85616942783243
Stephen said with tingling energy.	15.079146031325966
One who has faded into impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.	9.40724131653828
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin.	6.158912777026008
Who is the ghost from _limbo patrum_, returning to the world that has forgotten him?	9.375181280628183
Who is King Hamlet?	17.773471538584666
John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.	13.485967338931882
Lifted.	32.172570290454246
The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside.	17.43133955186813
The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.	10.76590088546891
Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.	7.952394424094043
Local colour.	11.471557475985025
Work in all you know.	7.850505246538908
Make them accomplices.	11.562093080720446
—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank.	12.843564160732885
But he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes.	9.425157290250551
The swan of Avon has other thoughts.	5.963977976850635
Composition of place.	6.8008886660720105
Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me! —The play begins.	11.979783548241171
A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the castoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice.	12.938035367813294
It is the ghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _Hamlet_ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre.	13.916794053768243
He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name: Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit, bidding him list.	10.294709011560668
To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, young Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.	11.055507310555301
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in the vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?	12.319641624468536
—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began impatiently.	16.023086189301385
Art thou there, truepenny?	14.957185770623104
—Interesting only to the parish clerk.	13.208847712496524
I mean, we have the plays.	13.723376451849687
I mean when we read the poetry of _King Lear_ what is it to us how the poet lived?	14.47184172966189
As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle has said.	6.774864035519606
Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet’s drinking, the poet’s debts.	14.652319453413533
We have _King Lear_: and it is immortal.	17.458483798418097
Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.	11.454484407296452
How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?	12.247645237006191
Marry, I wanted it.	8.761951588261969
Take thou this noble.	10.143598086636036
Go to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson’s bed, clergyman’s daughter.	12.895535185002771
Agenbite of inwit.	9.508471597620137
Do you intend to pay it back?	17.315149362142705
O, yes.	11.352923630235498
When?	18.814633242637697
Now?	25.535385961793953
Well...	2.748300511563768
No. When, then?	15.55113562599395
Steady on.	5.3851450255894875
He’s from beyant Boyne water.	7.202398783050665
The northeast corner.	6.668375944307278
You owe it.	3.8404063000936994
Five months.	12.72516319643597
Molecules all change.	8.0755813412657
Other I got pound.	12.60681908111612
Buzz.	22.307214335724723
Buzz.	22.307214335724723
But I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under everchanging forms.	7.13985342159139
I that sinned and prayed and fasted.	8.499552894656892
A child Conmee saved from pandies.	11.15948509983628
I, I and I.	6.128042136809375
I.	7.73347927951542
A.E.I.O.U. —Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?	17.573528999767095
John Eglinton’s carping voice asked.	10.73725303007348
Her ghost at least has been laid for ever.	9.209960503251295
She died, for literature at least, before she was born.	11.327415357943726
—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born.	11.149391207281395
She saw him into and out of the world.	8.89382998118707
She took his first embraces.	17.618486029322447
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed.	13.510287870144069
Mother’s deathbed.	26.3389625705993
Candle.	32.172570290454246
The sheeted mirror.	7.591587645724049
Who brought me into this world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers.	9.353337222394133
_Liliata rutilantium._ I wept alone.	7.720499835408042
John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.	17.584510408556483
—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got out of it as quickly and as best he could.	11.498574171729237
A man of genius makes no mistakes.	12.157893248984005
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.	7.8281993426949334
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	7.037358367054215
—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of discovery, one should imagine.	10.659211749694832
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe?	7.517578161085193
—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world.	12.90347802501934
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (_absit nomen!_), Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know.	11.402689652610798
But neither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.	8.783663887641117
—But Ann Hathaway?	16.00489013384428
Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully.	14.879517176304901
Yes, we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.	12.008353107870024
His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.	9.513829715408546
—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.	11.594137045227324
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling _The girl I left behind me._ If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle and her blue windows.	9.795610176661787
That memory, _Venus and Adonis_, lay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London.	7.6935737320751585
Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured?	9.022571001879152
Hortensio calls her young and beautiful.	10.005944282276529
Do you think the writer of _Antony and Cleopatra_, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal?	10.093769151410022
Good: he left her and gained the world of men.	9.701700920561294
But his boywomen are the women of a boy.	10.825720161530707
Their life, thought, speech are lent them by males.	9.70864743048147
He chose badly?	13.938980631925935
He was chosen, it seems to me.	8.293398604293394
If others have their will Ann hath a way.	5.99980546722
By cock, she was to blame.	11.291244156905902
The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself.	8.765992861784918
And my turn?	17.166847341083866
When?	18.814633242637697
Come! —Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly, brightly.	9.645359914126733
He murmured then with blond delight for all: Between the acres of the rye These pretty countryfolk would lie.	9.174447807821545
Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.	15.180816867140031
A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch.	6.1521076842845455
—I am afraid I am due at the _Homestead._ Whither away?	19.25425971929743
Exploitable ground.	8.425820152830982
—Are you going?	13.479987717059823
John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked.	10.045941870213584
Shall we see you at Moore’s tonight?	15.246886020561478
Piper is coming.	7.8528774325129005
—Piper! Mr Best piped.	15.328999540034324
Is Piper back?	11.22833303413413
Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.	5.8765437872798145
—I don’t know if I can.	15.002389207905333
Thursday.	20.267449269082853
We have our meeting.	14.361778778469366
If I can get away in time.	11.190400646986912
Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers.	11.168666698265787
The faithful hermetists await the light, ripe for chelaship, ringroundabout him.	4.040226338633573

Caulfield Irwin.	14.509135749322695
Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes, their pineal glands aglow.	8.64266036088382
Filled with his god, he thrones, Buddh under plantain.	12.724088215148413
Gulfer of souls, engulfer.	9.996520955421541
Hesouls, shesouls, shoals of souls.	5.637776083774426
Engulfed with wailing creecries, whirled, whirling, they bewail.	6.792700522773937
In quintessential triviality For years in this fleshcase a shesoul dwelt.	7.6959154310608024
—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said, friendly and earnest.	13.725840090760348
Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets’ verses.	8.658921250372572
We are all looking forward anxiously.	12.48678920047848
Anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces, lighted, shone.	8.702329571964063
See this.	7.707440706491812
Remember.	25.535385961793953
Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee.	12.19478906135241
My casque and sword.	7.943414147642791
Touch lightly with two index fingers.	8.849365839763887
Aristotle’s experiment.	26.859317139223922
One or two?	21.816772153484735
Necessity is that in virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise.	16.78122974046786
Argal, one hat is one hat.	10.796373509890984
Young Colum and Starkey.	7.966849103972261
George Roberts is doing the commercial part.	7.551541327487698
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he?	13.940238630950686
I liked Colum’s _Drover._ Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius.	11.313748742716648
Do you think he has genius really?	17.6193300051112
Yeats admired his line: _As in wild earth a Grecian vase_.	6.251636634401375
Did he?	12.260989469489418
I hope you’ll be able to come tonight.	15.03466488547549
Malachi Mulligan is coming too.	8.454733898348804
Moore asked him to bring Haines.	15.308400627164799
Did you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn?	13.16028555263111
That Moore is Martyn’s wild oats?	14.310083068634876
Awfully clever, isn’t it?	5.501898214072261
They remind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.	8.923435093848463
Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.	8.355048849865675
Moore is the man for it.	7.517878362202159
A knight of the rueful countenance here in Dublin.	9.95867420383882
With a saffron kilt?	19.532873062916167
O’Neill Russell?	25.920876716390296
O, yes, he must speak the grand old tongue.	14.099191795166462
And his Dulcinea?	18.930577028501475
James Stephens is doing some clever sketches.	8.94503480715829
We are becoming important, it seems.	11.377743910749903
Cordelia.	32.172570290454246
_Cordoglio._ Lir’s loneliest daughter.	13.283788542948223
Nookshotten.	32.172570290454246
Now your best French polish.	10.952683502054985
—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising.	12.884811656498579
If you will be so kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...	9.572348206691956
—O, yes.	8.495774270905248
If he considers it important it will go in.	6.6625663595595555
We have so much correspondence.	20.250432358864625
—I understand, Stephen said.	8.002219453499592
Thanks.	20.267449269082853
God ild you.	4.151395492131637
The pigs’ paper.	6.7675156692564835
Bullockbefriending.	32.172570290454246
Synge has promised me an article for _Dana_ too.	5.76569585280928
Are we going to be read?	22.550321815427324
I feel we are.	10.004967875283253
The Gaelic league wants something in Irish.	9.511867792506907
I hope you will come round tonight.	12.023114942906235
Bring Starkey.	12.200680240034972
Stephen sat down.	6.124641399102278
The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers.	16.115574266556365
Blushing, his mask said: —Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.	13.313317965158992
He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low: —Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?	12.811941021068339
Alarmed face asks me.	4.360920993210857
Why did he come?	17.562116278868423
Courtesy or an inward light?	12.866577242156064
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	12.114156161333815
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Christfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks, from hue and cry.	7.385130353525871
Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase.	13.383304643588636
Women he won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices, bully tapsters’ wives.	7.842384930096245
Fox and geese.	9.360319540637295
And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.	7.807064483154502
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
So you think...	3.4363983002437863
The door closed behind the outgoer.	14.222516305985263
Rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and brooding air.	5.477977464348297
A vestal’s lamp.	14.104486916018676
Here he ponders things that were not: what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of the possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when he lived among women.	9.3272307513211
Coffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.	6.337649450410856
Thoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned.	9.187864416966672
And I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest.	14.263324289819241
_In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks._ They are still.	6.771686670124144
Once quick in the brains of men.	9.884030255208128
Still: but an itch of death is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.	9.793243681837358
—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most enigmatic.	13.792746593042335
We know nothing but that he lived and suffered.	12.68337764195288
Not even so much.	10.381982532492417
Others abide our question.	6.586498061981062
A shadow hangs over all the rest.	9.278432251214234
—But _Hamlet_ is so personal, isn’t it?	8.547610995038504
Mr Best pleaded.	17.65351326006371
I mean, a kind of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life.	10.820957825916869
I mean, I don’t care a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...	8.19855564300696
He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance.	11.380446725766241
His private papers in the original.	13.80214459381548
_Ta an bad ar an tir.	8.025766199845945
Taim in mo shagart_.	9.714081906675197
Put beurla on it, littlejohn.	12.839375217521418
Quoth littlejohn Eglinton: —I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.	10.2711075229448
Bear with me.	5.169738227231629
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows.	4.823459502766375
A basilisk.	14.833002552262101
_E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca_.	7.80370542254345
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	10.618099721055557
—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, from day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave and unweave his image.	8.447074301036032
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth.	13.565870721637587
In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be.	10.819661007857755
So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.	13.011730618553011
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.	9.142526832783375
—Yes, Mr Best said youngly.	15.58037560270089
I feel Hamlet quite young.	10.418439640957704
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.	10.34645919857405
Has the wrong sow by the lug.	19.51956624445781
He is in my father.	15.542146122674207
I am in his son.	13.964811022178624
—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.	12.131213257768207
John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.	13.486547876174699
—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug in the market.	11.542641379786787
The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit.	8.297840598649646
—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.	15.863978551384097
—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a sundering.	13.417567722995303
Said that.	4.70330462927678
—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of _King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,_ look to see when and how the shadow lifts.	10.073793169821123
What softens the heart of a man, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince of Tyre?	7.41147079549132
Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.	6.8934320819085215
—A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.	16.241190122649652
—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity, John Eglinton detected.	11.613131474383051
The highroads are dreary but they lead to the town.	10.173227555056044
Good Bacon: gone musty.	8.505562600435573
Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats.	15.288248914354257
Cypherjugglers going the highroads.	11.126815494227264
Seekers on the great quest.	20.61196209238249
What town, good masters?	15.158621703488238
Mummed in names: A.	5.461111262736241
E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton.	9.645946330252073
East of the sun, west of the moon: _Tir na n-og_.	10.827678934919636
Booted the twain and staved.	8.149047799217222
How many miles to Dublin?	16.100847025407447
Three score and ten, sir.	4.636747018748578
Will we be there by candlelight?	11.985193127993144
—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing period.	13.576522760816166
—Does he?	8.319577790805562
What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is, say of it?	7.552275101191722
—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, that which was lost.	9.814422939375566
_My dearest wife_, Pericles says, _was like this maid._ Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother?	9.02843402367589
—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur.	18.31869868274031
_L’art d’être grand_...	3.6983852056440485
—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added, another image?	14.141582078274322
Do you know what you are talking about?	18.631273284844585
Love, yes.	9.118383105128844
Word known to all men.	8.39867018449562
_Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ..._ —His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience, material and moral.	8.003256506912276
Such an appeal will touch him.	4.637748368600715
The images of other males of his blood will repel him.	7.7035610957495555
He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.	7.747845309535688
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.	8.990355250580432
—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public.	17.109793270505783
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George Bernard Shaw.	12.265383788368062
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris.	8.271612590701904
His articles on Shakespeare in the _Saturday Review_ were surely brilliant.	9.516973329915416
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets.	13.012352704365888
The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke.	6.7399641772684875
I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have been.	9.560296652844148
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize of their fray.	10.460743684933727
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords.	9.324506084799012
Dost love, Miriam?	16.375071337459012
Dost love thy man?	9.782618076850316
—That may be too, Stephen said.	8.916558974508868
There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr Magee likes to quote.	10.061999388587003
Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life.	11.94031345404018
Why does he send to one who is a _buonaroba,_ a bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling to woo for him?	10.554331390445633
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written _Romeo and Juliet_.	12.912648682801443
Why?	12.512270304170855
Belief in himself has been untimely killed.	12.11302246111917
He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down.	10.146759382545211
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him.	5.6545790692563624
No later undoing will undo the first undoing.	10.004836659549186
The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding.	10.390193021322572
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman’s invisible weapon.	11.447215926339192
There is, I feel in the words, some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first, darkening even his own understanding of himself.	12.95524913898555
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.	11.976830844765848
They list.	10.570797566163494
And in the porches of their ears I pour.	17.488441620844938
—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear.	15.395941682595923
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come.	10.036170191591342
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator.	10.797787041216406
That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.	8.244578188962109
Ravisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted.	12.197271825254902
He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore.	16.27718184429822
But, because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed.	12.919177317106787
His beaver is up.	4.729155339580574
He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.	16.46919968852667
—Amen! was responded from the doorway.	9.751306098876121
Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?	13.613574432294103
A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles.	11.112158457722664
My telegram.	12.570867676935075
he asked of Stephen.	8.345401050195502
Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.	12.961838508633718
They make him welcome.	12.460706031625403
_Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen._ Brood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.	4.609048216234456
He Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself, Agenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends, stripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on crosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His Own Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already.	7.074751830700666
[Illustration] He lifts his hands.	7.07603484046385
Veils fall.	8.936616345537006
O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells aquiring.	10.838925312162264
—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said.	7.95889711342998
A most instructive discussion.	10.647982714245554
Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.	12.484745317869296
All sides of life should be represented.	16.614225276326287
He smiled on all sides equally.	15.364418577455394
Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled: —Shakespeare?	21.340491065121277
he said.	3.3900725752648877
I seem to know the name.	8.120032394398079
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.	10.709848631507144
—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly.	12.061513780286568
The chap that writes like Synge.	9.335144198051239
Mr Best turned to him.	7.444147998844961
—Haines missed you, he said.	4.609337144352468
Did you meet him?	13.84107224758606
He’ll see you after at the D.	17.008097123068566
C.	8.56499542248637
He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s _Lovesongs of Connacht_.	12.977427845048913
—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said.	8.590179026592446
Was he here?	15.863587459006167
—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising.	13.168713488909633
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin.	9.870029683972357
Vining held that the prince was a woman.	11.716298685829159
Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman?	17.64815951232745
Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues.	14.525641814079158
He swears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.	7.81177795563916
—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said, lifting his brilliant notebook.	14.420694572697718
That _Portrait of Mr W.	7.078207070005167
H._ where he proves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.	12.705078840348476
—For Willie Hughes, is it not?	11.378856474428208
the quaker librarian asked.	5.832866113039242
Or Hughie Wills?	12.502458635445878
Mr William Himself.	14.729581797828178
W.	10.471761903420298
H.: who am I?	12.36182322316172
—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily.	14.03281091388214
Of course it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out.	8.456876538461675
It’s the very essence of Wilde, don’t you know.	7.647507107509855
The light touch.	8.315479637134874
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.	13.787927457913364
Tame essence of Wilde.	10.117700452781865
You’re darned witty.	15.354168384901444
Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan Deasy’s ducats.	9.186012769925364
How much did I spend?	21.488826297768
O, a few shillings.	19.84841539630505
For a plump of pressmen.	10.857364356613491
Humour wet and dry.	8.376325267215075
Wit.	32.172570290454246
You would give your five wits for youth’s proud livery he pranks in.	7.909118302216954
There be many mo.	10.046203280539636
Take her for me.	5.976987573128992
In pairing time.	4.672382811239181
Jove, a cool ruttime send them.	9.744397815242534
Yea, turtledove her.	4.928438605072008
Eve.	25.535385961793953
Naked wheatbellied sin.	7.314707033709596
A snake coils her, fang in’s kiss.	10.300275296187506
—Do you think it is only a paradox?	16.90582841070192
the quaker librarian was asking.	9.399134048822432
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	10.215200481610411
They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.	12.80743661956252
Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile.	8.556120247115695
Then, his head wagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket.	13.492309886695578
His mobile lips read, smiling with new delight.	8.248908889943705
—Telegram! he said.	4.080886490030876
Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull! He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully: —_The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done._ Signed: Dedalus.	9.65237970021564
The kips?	17.96943513961382
Have you drunk the four quid?	14.011765837645378
The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father.	11.328508898634876
Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street.	7.84806357829897
O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite! Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue: —It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were, Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in.	10.013621350218095
’Twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching.	9.456734774962225
And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery’s sitting civil waiting for pints apiece.	9.770462955571778
He wailed: —And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.	12.19371171782531
Stephen laughed.	8.668454926516358
Quickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.	7.644412586800442
—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you.	8.623064864239561
He heard you pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule.	11.933567764035779
He’s out in pampooties to murder you.	7.131776161243255
—Me! Stephen exclaimed.	9.922233653293672
That was your contribution to literature.	11.386917225159154
Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.	16.30197024164979
—Murder you! he laughed.	10.126658806540393
Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts.	6.039226621159826
In words of words for words, palabras.	12.325115117137786
Faunman he met in Clamart woods, brandishing a winebottle.	6.719285321051031
_C’est vendredi saint!_ Murthering Irish.	10.010459194474546
His image, wandering, he met.	10.206317323909376
I mine.	8.23432995390934
I met a fool i’the forest.	9.198460109250881
—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.	15.459043233751801
—...	2.6475850980614206
in which everyone can find his own.	9.370606653668421
So Mr Justice Madden in his _Diary of Master William Silence_ has found the hunting terms...	5.2728083306478535
Yes?	20.267449269082853
What is it?	7.424324335348126
—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and offering a card.	13.826818699295549
—Certainly, certainly, certainly.	8.2818287141822
Is the gentleman?...	4.312044039760067
He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked, creaked, asked: —Is he?...	6.599076010257602
O, there! Brisk in a galliard he was off, out.	11.739146200021747
In the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honest broadbrim.	8.464531138148855
—This gentleman?	16.900014536292005
_Freeman’s Journal?	32.84093382668335
Kilkenny People?_ To be sure.	9.958730518055566
Good day, sir.	6.044691647746113
_Kilkenny_...	2.6475850980614206
We have certainly...	4.092695284915057
A patient silhouette waited, listening.	6.483285218924468
—All the leading provincial...	3.9794233626416875
_Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy Guardian,_ 1903...	3.268943420596352
Will you please?...	4.385342603565482
Evans, conduct this gentleman...	3.1243776915581862
If you just follow the atten...	4.792731498321289
This way...	2.6715608543870375
Please, sir...	2.8557630394620976
Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels.	10.586056755382966
The door closed.	13.006577681677683
—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.	11.061961177072094
He jumped up and snatched the card.	10.252059468326754
—What’s his name?	9.508221083496379
Ikey Moses?	18.920572859290925
Bloom.	7.595351801251561
He rattled on: —Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more.	7.977670345812227
I found him over in the museum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite.	12.876017152221753
The Greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer.	8.35928792623128
Every day we must do homage to her.	6.4765127504747815
_Life of life, thy lips enkindle._ Suddenly he turned to Stephen: —He knows you.	9.646295236892803
He knows your old fellow.	8.033423002962104
O, I fear me, he is Greeker than the Greeks.	17.82215806141634
His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.	9.30257958778895
Venus Kallipyge.	14.509135749322695
O, the thunder of those loins! _The god pursuing the maiden hid_.	10.793748091623836
—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval.	20.11654166381947
We begin to be interested in Mrs S.	10.032299839219949
Till now we had thought of her, if at all, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.	13.802434706192935
—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope.	7.329263884007141
Twenty years he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland.	12.170353467455067
His life was rich.	12.16241331918195
His art, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit.	9.744370709052513
Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies.	4.572503954099873
Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays.	12.421872755828538
The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba.	6.740425906683139
Twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures.	7.074815703806848
You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _Richard III_ and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from the capon’s blankets: _William the conqueror came before Richard III_.	12.341945476357944
And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.	9.810977180858034
Cours la Reine.	11.520508950675733
Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.	8.030257525544057
Minette?	32.172570290454246
Tu veux?_ —The height of fine society.	12.164138818819193
And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary.	11.679704306547212
Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed: —Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock! —And Harry of six wives’ daughter.	9.341920232397065
And other lady friends from neighbour seats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings.	5.628246475862771
But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?	10.209395000091646
Do and do.	6.698964135752241
Thing done.	8.48552953469927
In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, he walks, greyedauburn.	8.360568163982746
An azured harebell like her veins.	8.18886310815251
Lids of Juno’s eyes, violets.	13.02676145866269
He walks.	15.864225483576737
One life is all.	6.562710884328081
One body.	8.71649874025673
Do. But do.	6.104103519539461
Afar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.	9.596565263087763
Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.	17.77746786222935
—Whom do you suspect?	15.091589962468428
he challenged.	14.949365283168918
—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets.	15.136321585285593
Once spurned twice spurned.	9.96490786756613
But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.	17.823611947663736
Love that dare not speak its name.	6.216178313785716
Old wall where sudden lizards flash.	7.191486561447508
At Charenton I watched them.	4.954789875587625
—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all other and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the stallion.	12.909513217516626
Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife.	11.00114097088004
But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow.	12.079841882558645
Two deeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother.	9.643744326521885
Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in the blood.	14.412645133292521
Once a wooer, twice a wooer.	7.948562123331143
Stephen turned boldly in his chair.	13.578466418057893
—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning.	14.78724771543896
If you deny that in the fifth scene of _Hamlet_ he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him.	12.255287314471131
All those women saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.	10.613505158668806
In the years when he was living richly in royal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’s shepherd.	13.779984447003603
Explain you then.	6.253201553711663
Explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity.	9.944890194642811
He faced their silence.	7.859341639927832
To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.	8.590743817070907
But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.	18.55672841744497
She was entitled to her widow’s dower At common law.	13.840826718051307
His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us.	5.156919346603295
Him Satan fleers, Mocker: And therefore he left out her name From the first draft but he did not leave out The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters, For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford And in London.	10.375618347682112
And therefore when he was urged, As I believe, to name her He left her his Secondbest Bed.	10.480300075899219
_Punkt._ Leftherhis Secondbest Leftherhis Bestabed Secabest Leftabed.	6.44577717593507
Woa! —Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type.	9.830658552387455
—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist shareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer.	14.01542633550318
Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?	14.814772657842319
—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr Secondbest Best said finely.	14.995364380045705
—_Separatio a mensa et a thalamo_, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled on.	5.069308001373412
—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.	5.95644955903129
Let me think.	12.021908837254934
—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage, Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.	8.661049968788053
Mr Best asked with slight concern.	13.11094684725276
I mean...	2.7194239558374584
—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped.	16.813894008101983
A quart of ale is a dish for a king.	12.522034091030104
O, I must tell you what Dowden said! —What?	15.674307474347533
asked Besteglinton.	14.509135749322695
William Shakespeare and company, limited.	9.137138478974165
The people’s William.	16.22057128239796
For terms apply: E.	5.273112406517227
Dowden, Highfield house...	2.8240017179348578
—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously.	11.739530322032069
I asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard.	12.716673796858728
He lifted his hands and said: _All we can say is that life ran very high in those days._ Lovely! Catamite.	10.779709337641378
—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to ugling Eglinton.	10.782935701160094
Steadfast John replied severe: —The doctor can tell us what those words mean.	9.236118334553796
You cannot eat your cake and have it.	4.9789163384745585
Sayest thou so?	8.225116777511673
Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?	12.57132717213859
—And the sense of property, Stephen said.	6.317741790861977
He drew Shylock out of his own long pocket.	10.873620402043963
The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.	11.129175071435062
His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing.	5.599947340335084
He sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent.	8.283235223218346
How else could Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick?	11.214751589072518
All events brought grist to his mill.	11.458019966898075
Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: _Hamlet_ and _Macbeth_ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.	11.647935409378835
The lost armada is his jeer in _Love’s Labour Lost_.	10.820940729661295
His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.	9.986299032291882
Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory of equivocation.	12.563375843615662
The sugared sonnets follow Sidney’s.	4.263436894920473
As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, let some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket.	8.428343163199383
I think you’re getting on very nicely.	13.055464511730483
Just mix up a mixture of theolologicophilolological.	10.96579283996472
_Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere._ —Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly.	8.458125899374565
Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman.	11.25828283277513
—A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded.	19.83407179379821
Coleridge called him myriadminded.	14.109148030473364
_Amplius.	25.535385961793953
In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos._ —Saint Thomas, Stephen began...	4.7765529595622125
—_Ora pro nobis_, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.	5.872235058413387
There he keened a wailing rune.	10.761086957618602
—_Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!_ It’s destroyed we are from this day! It’s destroyed we are surely! All smiled their smiles.	11.202140742562943
—Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions.	10.659873706072368
He means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be, hungers for it.	7.64343257372386
Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage.	9.6307904892882
Accusations are made in anger.	10.747437277577983
The christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel.	8.48148985246271
Whether these be sins or virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet.	7.677430936060062
But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife.	9.451217934356276
No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass.	8.305133500068385
—Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.	10.06307280020405
—Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.	5.82439412181016
—Which will?	17.3466029369114
gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan.	7.382456986781457
We are getting mixed.	18.257112011184773
—The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’s widow, is the will to die.	11.444082081639804
_—Requiescat!_ Stephen prayed.	17.56381381115294
What of all the will to do?	12.298247470581755
It has vanished long ago...	3.7663438668239437
—She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled queen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.	12.182934253959479
In old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul.	9.478922405715553
She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the _Merry Wives_ and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over _Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches_ and _The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze_.	7.113063613655061
Venus has twisted her lips in prayer.	7.530302461969583
Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience.	7.680797461282173
It is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god.	12.034493221878886
The ages succeed one another.	6.116024936083758
But we have it on high authority that a man’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family.	14.812578894053209
I feel that Russell is right.	7.115237916709212
What do we care for his wife or father?	15.867736896015389
I should say that only family poets have family lives.	8.533338207202423
Falstaff was not a family man.	9.317893902375086
I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.	13.890064164203162
Lean, he lay back.	10.841904527107744
Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid.	11.0155598426966
Shy, supping with the godless, he sneaks the cup.	11.019439668249728
A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him.	3.83572178818985
Visits him here on quarter days.	6.664949554138326
Mr Magee, sir, there’s a gentleman to see you.	8.36382215569869
Me?	17.705247751504768
Give me my Wordsworth.	15.82942648673334
Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.	8.363990634315691
Your own?	18.237413043613476
He knows your old fellow.	8.033423002962104
The widower.	12.599539896325004
Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched his hand.	8.34852856300786
The voice, new warmth, speaking.	9.76922013575535
Dr Bob Kenny is attending her.	4.294902088012855
The eyes that wish me well.	8.473327108750913
But do not know me.	8.117724890058302
—A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary evil.	12.324906309597308
He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death.	11.035299033586819
If you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfive years of life, _nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita_, with fifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen.	10.022861900276693
No. The corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night.	8.43825573994558
From hour to hour it rots and rots.	8.05630405030041
He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon his son.	6.231079951601104
Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child.	13.731693208124376
Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man.	9.549558047967588
It is a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten.	9.945402247563656
On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.	8.442790830191889
Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood.	11.411695188743227
_Amor matris_, subjective and objective genitive, may be the only true thing in life.	6.403687922866201
Paternity may be a legal fiction.	14.015564743997748
Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son?	12.8707649436741
What the hell are you driving at?	13.239694283048689
I know.	6.625264570568742
Shut up.	4.963090012978215
Blast you.	4.8544980376981
I have reasons.	27.542132867218914
_Amplius.	25.535385961793953
Adhuc.	32.172570290454246
Iterum.	32.172570290454246
Postea._ Are you condemned to do this?	13.668622802327535
—They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardly record its breach.	9.75835911179275
Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls.	5.007554880962465
The son unborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases care.	7.402501279479293
He is a new male: his growth is his father’s decline, his youth his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.	17.170792535594977
In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.	4.812688917329154
—What links them in nature?	23.492978591828972
An instant of blind rut.	8.949591140787021
Am I a father?	11.932291294897952
If I were?	22.226516813372214
Shrunken uncertain hand.	5.046785506718716
—Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son.	10.47882696816774
The bulldog of Aquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him.	5.820076593284322
Well: if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son?	15.151627777790985
When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote _Hamlet_ he was not the father of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.	12.915861696302857
Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly.	11.032798053481148
Rarely.	32.172570290454246
But flatter.	14.509135749322695
—Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself.	7.453114472419785
I am big with child.	12.50999154014517
I have an unborn child in my brain.	12.637326676594602
Pallas Athena! A play! The play’s the thing! Let me parturiate! He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.	9.552348046964266
—As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forest of Arden.	15.571891229342166
Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in _Coriolanus._ His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in _King John._ Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare.	9.948522063959336
Who the girls in _The Tempest_, in _Pericles,_ in _Winter’s Tale_ are we know.	9.365258276331025
Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess.	8.490097004750474
But there is another member of his family who is recorded.	18.96524977004776
—The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.	6.689970785048531
The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste, quake, quack.	7.53701791167171
Door closed.	11.477495343874615
Cell.	32.172570290454246
Day.	25.535385961793953
They list.	10.570797566163494

They.	25.535385961793953
I you he they.	10.822138338225503
Come, mess.	19.546185122608602
STEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard.	10.969942906776408
Gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up in Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on’s back.	8.073586562115391
The playhouse sausage filled Gilbert’s soul.	7.991923071050962
He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are recorded in the works of sweet William.	12.959891537585216
MAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What’s in a name?	8.914064214406201
BEST: That is my name, Richard, don’t you know.	9.172752690844202
I hope you are going to say a good word for Richard, don’t you know, for my sake.	12.84356716233346
STEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago, Richard Crookback, Edmund in _King Lear_, two bear the wicked uncles’ names.	7.487810821892814
Nay, that last play was written or being written while his brother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.	9.995488600193106
BEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it.	11.046622560337195
I don’t want Richard, my name ...	6.486104888541245
_(Laughter)_ QUAKERLYSTER: (_A tempo_) But he that filches from me my good name...	8.586849524598671
STEPHEN: _(Stringendo)_ He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William, in the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas.	17.720096219559743
He has revealed it in the sonnets where there is Will in overplus.	14.468586786302847
Like John o’Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country.	8.359217184443276
What’s in a name?	12.269764977406554
That is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours.	11.682029799336641
A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.	15.419008856151747
It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars.	11.243620555385984
His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery and from her arms.	11.503414013404878
Both satisfied.	12.599539896325004
I too.	4.827515357345565
Don’t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.	19.878559933150697
And from her arms.	10.51090989677969
Wait to be wooed and won.	15.778982722568028
Ay, meacock.	22.503024334631103
Who will woo you?	6.4964331432040785
Read the skies.	15.479884253238147
_Autontimorumenos.	32.172570290454246
Bous Stephanoumenos._ Where’s your configuration?	14.783382654377863
Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even.	14.454406272478508

D._ —What is that, Mr Dedalus?	16.3316731080327
the quaker librarian asked.	5.832866113039242
Was it a celestial phenomenon?	16.0622493400235
—A star by night, Stephen said.	7.723228480736185
A pillar of the cloud by day.	8.790514468750146
What more’s to speak?	15.00699548976249
Stephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.	15.842071695637042
_Stephanos,_ my crown.	9.763222526914221
My sword.	12.599539896325004
His boots are spoiling the shape of my feet.	8.51901397543947
Buy a pair.	14.843900760401246
Holes in my socks.	16.25586516182193
Handkerchief too.	4.66219583534958
—You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed.	14.35993598346611
Your own name is strange enough.	10.60009829653286
I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.	8.962336657071576
Me, Magee and Mulligan.	7.63698907712788
Fabulous artificer.	14.509135749322695
The hawklike man.	4.932304678657261
You flew.	9.477444696035231
Whereto?	32.172570290454246
Newhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger.	6.827890720229505
Lapwing.	22.307214335724723
Icarus.	32.172570290454246
_Pater, ait._ Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering.	8.784577638535552
Lapwing you are.	6.8819594790409315
Lapwing be.	7.17727289210271
Mr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say: —That’s very interesting because that brother motive, don’t you know, we find also in the old Irish myths.	11.39131448611959
Just what you say.	7.9487144475749805
The three brothers Shakespeare.	9.650751903623831
In Grimm too, don’t you know, the fairytales.	12.303072437532064
The third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.	8.399054940201403
Good, better, best.	10.390100968744415
The quaker librarian springhalted near.	9.022250309598302
—I should like to know, he said, which brother you...	8.385790204087696
I understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers...	8.662914670415722
But perhaps I am anticipating?	19.53555438500562
He caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.	12.37698665424206
An attendant from the doorway called: —Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...	6.642461154790485
—O, Father Dineen! Directly.	14.893827319291908
Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.	8.075741037628257
John Eglinton touched the foil.	14.848592203423891
—Come, he said.	4.387304911468286
Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.	14.625594736947427
You kept them for the last, didn’t you?	8.114762709481262
—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and nuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps.	10.698953047497232
A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.	8.963720649189439
Lapwing.	22.307214335724723
Where is your brother?	21.46690886495198
Apothecaries’ hall.	8.35689758896914
My whetstone.	14.509135749322695
Him, then Cranly, Mulligan: now these.	12.958491584849664
Speech, speech.	9.887194872665987
But act.	10.690278245847093
Act speech.	9.603019217156854
They mock to try you.	5.309651049087183
Act.	32.172570290454246
Be acted on.	4.778928569754333
Lapwing.	22.307214335724723
I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau.	19.509273067482983
My kingdom for a drink.	10.219272123399595
On. —You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays.	16.229563511936682
Why did he take them rather than others?	16.988788094896602
Richard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow.	10.227284064954766
Richard the conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered.	7.6089074869968645
The other four acts of that play hang limply from that first.	8.710932990508178
Of all his kings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world.	12.322253404085952
Why is the underplot of _King Lear_ in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s _Arcadia_ and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?	11.512744139085047
—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended.	18.165226243910542
We should not now combine a Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith.	8.856043784862822
_Que voulez-vous?_ Moore would say.	6.205821762564437
He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes Ulysses quote Aristotle.	9.88356697219089
—Why?	11.984639852917844
Stephen answered himself.	9.182593021735817
Because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him.	10.95764833335848
The note of banishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_ onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book.	5.846707831003395
It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.	8.010715129815837
It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery.	10.995562464408925
But it was the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil.	9.5185402162742
The words are those of my lords bishops of Maynooth.	11.268610529237408
An original sin and, like original sin, committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned.	8.194933173805351
It is between the lines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid.	15.53604652797868
Age has not withered it.	5.371481458889037
Beauty and peace have not done it away.	8.04303142982464
It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in _Much Ado about Nothing_, twice in _As you like It_, in _The Tempest_, in _Hamlet,_ in _Measure for Measure_—and in all the other plays which I have not read.	10.273022637074051
He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.	15.454329294512178
Judge Eglinton summed up.	4.454301974710361
—The truth is midway, he affirmed.	15.830398321551721
He is the ghost and the prince.	16.85697247730084
—He is, Stephen said.	6.276136981837421
The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.	10.7799375796197
All in all.	6.484129370951642
In _Cymbeline,_ in _Othello_ he is bawd and cuckold.	8.290369824827803
He acts and is acted on.	5.34563345688513
Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the real Carmen.	11.2858957510307
His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer.	9.092464060619015
—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly.	7.187409854701492
O word of fear! Dark dome received, reverbed.	7.847412430005459
—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.	10.122806907386009
When all is said Dumas _fils_ (or is it Dumas _père?)_ is right.	8.210541575127513
After God Shakespeare has created most.	9.395444870167966
—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said.	4.519257981061973
He returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has always been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth.	12.059185124985742
Then dies.	11.308115195751736
The motion is ended.	8.818829577472611
Gravediggers bury Hamlet _père_ and Hamlet _fils._ A king and a prince at last in death, with incidental music.	9.516468924888834
If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go.	11.047540203665895
Strong curtain.	11.270644664569899
He found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible.	11.42243153868496
Maeterlinck says: _If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep.	9.733667683150808
If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend._ Every life is many days, day after day.	6.499468527876798
We walk through ourselves, meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows, brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves.	7.389478905882353
The playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholics call _dio boia_, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto himself.	10.13154316566462
_—Eureka!_ Buck Mulligan cried.	14.114656688226411
_Eureka!_ Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk.	14.229316417695495
—May I?	9.929219464014883
he said.	3.3900725752648877
The Lord has spoken to Malachi.	7.9009232687977216
He began to scribble on a slip of paper.	9.860171242543327
Take some slips from the counter going out.	9.224967849771543
—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall live.	10.598963582135989
The rest shall keep as they are.	6.989073851370394
He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.	9.454539004448925
Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of _The Taming of the Shrew._ —You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen.	7.28037461556866
You have brought us all this way to show us a French triangle.	19.985094741793265
Do you believe your own theory?	22.88140773680683
—No, Stephen said promptly.	16.888701437867905
—Are you going to write it?	10.371362355036174
Mr Best asked.	7.890359445288962
You ought to make it a dialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.	9.380665948292322
John Eclecticon doubly smiled.	6.616722130552193
Dowden believes there is some mystery in _Hamlet_ but will say no more.	6.618108430165286
Herr Bleibtreu, the man Piper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument.	10.891379859951082
He is going to visit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays.	10.847007441157864
It will come as a surprise to his grace.	19.602462792453686
But he believes his theory.	13.588572316646086
I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief.	11.53149044632119
That is, help me to believe or help me to unbelieve?	16.49090187361754
Who helps to believe?	13.452463713656165
_Egomen._ Who to unbelieve?	11.236609225383882
Other chap.	9.099458324229795
—You are the only contributor to _Dana_ who asks for pieces of silver.	9.302690186640818
Then I don’t know about the next number.	16.138916144875044
Fred Ryan wants space for an article on economics.	9.798687588106322
Fraidrine.	32.172570290454246
Two pieces of silver he lent me.	5.351646302303537
Tide you over.	6.192251473069797
Economics.	32.172570290454246
—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.	11.58392149051655
Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravely said, honeying malice: —I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper Mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the _Summa contra Gentiles_ in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie, the coalquay whore.	12.41598511106775
He broke away.	7.455326176742667
—Come, Kinch.	9.03106122453859
Come, Kinch.	11.537438912464461
You have eaten all we left.	8.954183964456243
Ay. I will serve you your orts and offals.	10.076109657639535
Stephen rose.	7.919999973657108
Life is many days.	7.2954333457056215
This will end.	6.911935443780882
—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said.	7.943579433498414
_Notre ami_ Moore says Malachi Mulligan must be there.	6.7400185566463975
Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.	11.813495155002121
—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of Ireland.	8.424268706370905
I’ll be there.	9.022428601169162
Come, Kinch, the bards must drink.	11.323914317595507
Can you walk straight?	19.776184829302352

I gall his kibe.	9.222440284258738
Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.	9.95643218384824
What have I learned?	16.804123428892733

—O please do, sir...	5.580512055844004
I shall be most pleased...	4.764422733999265
Amused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding: —A pleased bottom.	10.577801027260584

—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned.	10.266775276007293
Synge has left off wearing black to be like nature.	10.354497615875532
Only crows, priests and English coal are black.	5.690063869881473
A laugh tripped over his lips.	7.4718397361818285
—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old hake Gregory.	11.670551147312361
O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus.	10.081905971333734
Couldn’t you do the Yeats touch?	15.059717946395876
He went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms: —The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.	10.636352651442092
One thinks of Homer.	12.248373665165674
He stopped at the stairfoot.	17.7640992292314
—I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.	16.45160503082807
The pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined.	8.008929985529848
Gone the nine men’s morrice with caps of indices.	11.269989166629069
In sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet: _Everyman His Own Wife or A Honeymoon in the Hand (a national immorality in three orgasms) by Ballocky Mulligan._ He turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying: —The disguise, I fear, is thin.	10.406830879672844
But listen.	13.279478100620349
He read, _marcato:_ —Characters: TOBY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole) CRAB (a bushranger) MEDICAL DICK ) and ) (two birds with one stone) MEDICAL DAVY ) MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier) FRESH NELLY and ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).	6.211737259319332
He laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen: and mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men: —O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to lift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured, multicoloured, multitudinous vomit! —The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted them.	9.454069818509897
About to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.	12.870280528243185
Part.	32.172570290454246
The moment is now.	5.355301434743774

If Socrates leave his house today, if Judas go forth tonight.	8.417869059073045
Why?	12.512270304170855
That lies in space which I in time must come to, ineluctably.	10.414788459173819
My will: his will that fronts me.	5.811789681776856
Seas between.	11.531898032124008
A man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.	12.380615220573151
—Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.	6.837284055836386

—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe.	16.84921224553729
Did you see his eye?	19.044337220474354
He looked upon you to lust after you.	8.37052226033151
I fear thee, ancient mariner.	10.934525869295198

A dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway, under portcullis barbs.	11.319106570413725
They followed.	12.058170129459228
Offend me still.	7.292479987124542
Speak on.	5.3851450255894875
Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street.	4.515526493137538
No birds.	10.58374593461624
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw of softness softly were blown.	8.122058841463161
Cease to strive.	11.563941264620462

[ 10 ] The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.	7.84336822306274
Five to three.	8.350639726350664
Just nice time to walk to Artane.	10.419638556107893
What was that boy’s name again?	19.11966616082396
Dignam.	14.05266445304813
_Vere dignum et iustum est._ Brother Swan was the person to see.	6.104947545707399
Mr Cunningham’s letter.	11.899406182316032
Oblige him, if possible.	16.8473649383153
Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.	4.501015391861229
A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes.	7.0795772853113235
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S.	8.564017585964264
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.	15.05069318244184
He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: _If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days._ He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. —Very well, indeed, father.	11.29821528866181
And you, father?	19.166772060431484
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed.	9.081222317612816
He would go to Buxton probably for the waters.	14.147726533535502
And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere?	13.656861772063559
Was that so?	12.2547532652715
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.	7.4312216293313345
And Mr Sheehy himself?	9.97047115739498
Still in London.	8.948358391895235
The house was still sitting, to be sure it was.	9.192539270472581
Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed.	9.12355095934072
Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach.	13.497267557816244
O, yes: a very great success.	21.71580938332122
A wonderful man really.	6.830084617648397
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.	12.551526941916487
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun.	12.857365277323867
And smiled yet again, in going.	9.97087080331186
He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.	14.20553478578882
Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.	12.041157413597109
—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?	8.448745295485837
A zealous man, however.	10.112764113679676
Really he was.	5.897117154553017
And really did great good in his way.	8.4812023430909
Beyond a doubt.	9.142914268041737
He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.	9.768966025359887
Of good family too would one think it?	6.707910783245129
O, lest he forget.	16.59997825503651
That letter to father provincial.	9.048016478966618
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square.	10.594076548255181
The little house.	7.219941125336549
Aha.	25.535385961793953
And were they good boys at school?	12.822234953616952
And what was his name?	12.580554189900242
Jack Sohan.	14.509135749322695
And his name?	14.072051302017298
Ger.	32.172570290454246
Gallaher.	32.172570290454246
And the other little man?	21.761047506067303
His name was Brunny Lynam.	12.933541740415455
O, that was a very nice name to have.	13.199910382433139
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.	10.876170090099436
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed: —O, sir.	7.315479108965502
—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.	10.101281973754112
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox.	12.403473097702278
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.	10.389679574296528
Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.	8.648785916224174
Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?	14.512576264914133
Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed.	9.614903383757815
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted.	11.997348677034015
How did she do?	13.519405622335611
A fine carriage she had.	6.522461951486015
Like Mary, queen of Scots, something.	7.243157000278161
what should he say?...	3.2108153177409493
such a queenly mien.	15.475500493026422
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left.	11.387013451378921
The reverend T.	8.746121025999784
R.	13.682684331782813
Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak.	12.578276711432437
The incumbent they called him.	4.803808018251307
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words.	11.445635274586577
But one should be charitable.	17.892593726356008
Invincible ignorance.	15.009292486789496
They acted according to their lights.	12.120379536700545
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road.	11.436130062744551
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.	14.464204976763947
Surely, there ought to be.	10.022204300816231
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street.	4.970946891509926
All raised untidy caps.	9.835522715061757
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.	14.540051507192418
Christian brother boys.	9.025125352164954
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked.	14.961216209048223
Saint Joseph’s church, Portland row.	10.912847207578803
For aged and virtuous females.	8.221022883717106
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament.	19.179752266867883
Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.	13.74707483439947
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman.	10.443913035349428
And now it was an office or something.	11.608686967592686
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop.	15.337463052991643
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter.	6.689456562637933
He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York.	8.657246366134377
In America those things were continually happening.	8.770078958859743
Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared.	13.074358324664898
Still, an act of perfect contrition.	19.633473880003578
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged.	14.357484779232419
They saluted him and were saluted.	11.62406506535917
Father Conmee passed H.	10.385958248183755
O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.	12.126780111481372
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable.	10.245934677408739
In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	10.923278069343507
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him.	7.858898933538592
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.	5.964885814345857
of saint Francis Xavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.	11.500107052981873
C.	8.56499542248637
of saint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.	12.010661491362947
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.	8.046645479938299
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.	12.901101395552864
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket.	7.539624003816339
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap.	14.223118338725499
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.	14.570184967229098
It was a peaceful day.	12.1759642300156
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down.	9.172348759429848
His wife, Father Conmee supposed.	18.4462232293024
A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses.	12.204436767896608
She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.	7.342497694519923
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car.	14.04425709174914
He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.	13.571625413447823
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	12.569901286874353
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight.	11.92511160675192
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her.	5.3222193551755925
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice _bless you, my child,_ that they have been absolved, _pray for me._ But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.	13.581223105412711
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.	7.305368638463477
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.	9.344902446557057
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night.	12.335930685964934
That book by the Belgian jesuit, _Le Nombre des Élus,_ seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea.	8.509805513953514
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought.	9.667203137942844
But they were God’s souls, created by God.	12.037900180350753
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.	9.85032352785748
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.	13.06903075485303
The Malahide road was quiet.	7.990453567864443
It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.	6.145349339928563
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide.	6.691721354409853
Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.	7.423805710127828
Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.	10.41398733070051
Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book _Old Times in the Barony_ and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.	10.957840257079438
A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged.	8.008591789826989
Who could know the truth?	15.856060743279428
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, _eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris,_ with her husband’s brother?	8.267253391964019
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did.	9.613547275310987
Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.	10.826210290347545
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.	10.761745943653123
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore.	10.172114619283978
He was humane and honoured there.	6.986017045352669
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters.	7.933391218260095
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.	10.917095982434757
It was a charming day.	12.86256571056234
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves.	10.057971570056582
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind.	8.64784172529762
_Moutonner,_ the French said.	5.133464296943204
A just and homely word.	6.123661089863144
Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey.	7.312616273947197
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field.	7.652423785334414
He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening.	14.72197624706988
He was their rector: his reign was mild.	10.525532277729898
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out.	9.606721330605707
An ivory bookmark told him the page.	9.010993259624525
Nones.	32.172570290454246
He should have read that before lunch.	13.074558843843072
But lady Maxwell had come.	6.675165670035379
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	7.649174970645208
_Deus in adiutorium._ He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to _Res_ in _Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ._ A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand.	7.995128919446734
The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	11.087313687087173
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.	13.281932894830362
_Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum._ * * * Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner.	7.398060887663467
He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings.	9.101726706464348
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway.	8.524138490948713
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.	9.694116476862213
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.	8.971244957494358
Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.	8.098860970468541
—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.	15.22668114090359
—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.	5.747945737420569
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.	9.146253159367673
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.	12.281505240965641
* * * A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting Rabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street.	8.72700135444397
Towards Larry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably: —_For England_...	9.32646801505975
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled: —_home and beauty._ J.	7.23813137905664
O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.	15.742351182884981
A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her.	7.8600801209298785
The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.	9.168177209550768
He halted and growled angrily: —_For England_...	5.255049903441341
Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.	9.538581140241886
The blind of the window was drawn aside.	10.742623776609516
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ slipped from the sash and fell.	8.406260867389047
A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps.	9.607517292845543
A woman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings.	12.45361900916844
It fell on the path.	12.818493679598673
One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel’s cap, saying: —There, sir.	12.343843874872437
* * * Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.	12.125058810782342
—Did you put in the books?	23.426393025049737
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	8.18875497257138
—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.	9.51955091296447
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.	11.708528501070596
—Where did you try?	25.115884071886846
—M’Guinness’s.	6.424673105983199
Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.	8.517679268132856
—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.	8.405793451424916
Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.	7.954007398015822
—What’s in the pot?	19.805588000219227
she asked.	5.621765666472605
—Shirts, Maggy said.	3.074843203476558
Boody cried angrily: —Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?	14.359922886027345
Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked: —And what’s in this?	12.03452417575155
A heavy fume gushed in answer.	6.533099011821396
—Peasoup, Maggy said.	3.074843203476558
—Where did you get it?	12.690463012439281
Katey asked.	5.295771030513646
—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.	3.6951727346004586
The lacquey rang his bell.	8.572267247267133
—Barang! Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily: —Give us it here.	9.95512504707291
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl.	12.67853855871774
Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs: —A good job we have that much.	11.594026649169171
Where’s Dilly?	29.828115649413963
—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.	5.801544905123257
Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added: —Our father who art not in heaven.	11.408031603748176
Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed: —Boody! For shame! A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.	8.201195542046255
* * * The blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre.	9.697163783496507
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.	11.691641452772261
—Put these in first, will you?	7.249601600936074
he said.	3.3900725752648877
—Yes, sir, the blond girl said.	7.5715565465266925
And the fruit on top.	14.11035142527998
—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.	7.7254637900446435
Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.	8.014140776835122
H.	11.481841078558022
E.	10.594970405422256
L.	11.002864267888413
Y.’S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.	7.698820859569088
—Can you send them by tram?	16.576686587503104
Now?	25.535385961793953
A darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	10.132222226516733
—Certainly, sir.	5.056872575176414
Is it in the city?	25.96186008578595
—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said.	7.533818993108774
The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.	11.186568148993675
Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.	7.7758579882192524
—Send it at once, will you?	8.069243165325705
he said.	3.3900725752648877
It’s for an invalid.	17.288375656088455
I will, sir.	6.239765222489605
Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.	10.517646356084839
—What’s the damage?	15.525878440004892
he asked.	5.571194519539272
The blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.	10.900895890978578
Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse.	18.51497637616391
A young pullet.	14.375447455944828
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.	17.18320844964319
—This for me?	10.03456304497763
he asked gallantly.	23.14500271661914
The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.	10.897569977535422
—Yes, sir, she said.	5.332094101059834
Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.	6.165958872187768
—May I say a word to your telephone, missy?	12.057611035929455
he asked roguishly.	22.752193459446005
* * * _—Ma!_ Almidano Artifoni said.	8.168598145301058
He gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.	14.299489386896797
Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests.	7.2470986756621505
Palefaces.	32.172570290454246
Men’s arms frankly round their stunted forms.	10.30078746111832
They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.	11.859387199061674
—_Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee_, Almidano Artifoni said, _quand’ ero giovine come Lei.	5.645149660016932
Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.	5.741973706994061
È peccato.	14.509135749322695
Perchè la sua voce...	2.6348258257150303
sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.	6.373495421144058
Invece, Lei si sacrifica._ —_Sacrifizio incruento,_ Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.	8.545388479164352
_—Speriamo,_ the round mustachioed face said pleasantly.	9.918221403620398
_Ma, dia retta a me.	4.273988501389254
Ci rifletta_.	14.509135749322695
By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.	9.134407178169486
—_Ci rifletterò,_ Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.	11.144179209472728
—_Ma, sul serio, eh?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	4.58629149387233
His heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly.	14.530897630033092
Human eyes.	5.455646160485135
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.	7.2375371260469
_—Eccolo,_ Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste.	13.107086988755475
_Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi.	7.5997519357169745
Addio, caro._ —_Arrivederla, maestro,_ Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed.	11.317797058917467
_E grazie._ —_Di che?_ Almidano Artifoni said.	5.844382361428589
_Scusi, eh?	7.673417198419805
Tante belle cose!_ Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram.	8.353631364140764
In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.	5.697708659059892
* * * Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of _The Woman in White_ far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.	8.083975469688038
Too much mystery business in it.	5.314099158328149
Is he in love with that one, Marion?	17.56388250735733
Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.	10.221171998898843
The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.	5.8245932145803625
Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard: —16 June 1904.	11.33963038672704
Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H.	8.936253812897382
E.	10.594970405422256
L.	11.002864267888413
Y.’S and plodded back as they had come.	9.23029434293307
Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses.	8.140532179278102
Mustard hair and dauby cheeks.	9.352684118020248
She’s not nicelooking, is she?	13.399872655010059
The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt.	17.323170983678366
Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight.	12.628800658876699
If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s.	7.717078843303543
They kick out grand.	8.95561636240566
Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her.	8.903169161035894
Hope to goodness he won’t keep me here till seven.	10.089160330715105
The telephone rang rudely by her ear.	8.204839193992465
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
No, sir.	8.459302619677356
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
I’ll ring them up after five.	12.564333909090266
All right, sir.	6.45509895461702
Then I can go after six if you’re not back.	11.03879811609797
A quarter after.	6.832472982835087
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
Twentyseven and six.	7.458760393137905
Yes: one, seven, six.	10.555119709651217
She scribbled three figures on an envelope.	8.241745433020695
—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from _Sport_ was in looking for you.	8.191242560737752
Mr Lenehan, yes.	8.330976689028581
He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four.	13.015386216955267
No, sir.	8.459302619677356
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
I’ll ring them up after five.	12.564333909090266
* * * Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.	15.785577445005433
—Who’s that?	8.253891539663885
Is that Crotty?	24.947407878393292
—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.	10.00217860916267
—Hello, Jack, is that yourself?	12.545626894043613
Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches.	9.460613208502798
Come on.	5.866048127058964
Mind your steps there.	5.42305817008423
The vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall.	13.849938223127088
At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.	6.6482384720161996
—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.	12.141631506733543
—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily.	12.315840230589826
We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534.	10.317456642199298
This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.	12.669454714169925
O’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.	12.854740348078769
The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road.	9.986285946306113
You were never here before, Jack, were you?	10.205681453991431
—No, Ned.	10.709187829925845
—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me.	9.360355869644545
The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.	12.877599344820043
—That’s right, Ned Lambert said.	7.227269236757696
That’s quite right, sir.	11.221158981028227
—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...	10.2884598383362
—Certainly, Ned Lambert said.	4.675180158540128
Bring the camera whenever you like.	6.5432434730694125
I’ll get those bags cleared away from the windows.	13.848837247522587
You can take it from here or from here.	11.979048121649338
In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.	8.703812861098243
From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.	12.6036771979729
—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said.	10.570148379900992
I won’t trespass on your valuable time...	6.2503376057635505
Drop in whenever you like.	7.7745527905201905
Next week, say.	5.763390048978738
Can you see?	15.323450463701
—Yes, yes.	7.656310730657421
Good afternoon, Mr Lambert.	12.781004261243483
Very pleased to have met you.	8.794813743196588
—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.	8.218449914817368
He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars.	12.13414129536827
With J.	4.907412681013932
O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O’Connor, Wexford.	8.217885147223184
He stood to read the card in his hand.	9.691478913833466
—The reverend Hugh C.	9.576234168852622
Love, Rathcoffey.	14.402349746096075
Present address: Saint Michael’s, Sallins.	9.203325908689475
Nice young chap he is.	5.386259604611282
He’s writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me.	10.358240724173832
He’s well up in history, faith.	13.756813118872806
The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.	9.246471845537878
—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J.	11.361195556506589
O’Molloy said.	5.225530749791196
Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.	10.954507885380899
—God! he cried.	9.889540983664563
I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral.	14.223578300216873
You know that one?	22.453802578938298
_I’m bloody sorry I did it,_ says he, _but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside._ He mightn’t like it, though.	10.524820072418311
God, I’ll tell him anyhow.	12.877071998354785
That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor.	19.320933882760404
The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness.	8.482857197871606
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried: —Woa, sonny! He turned to J.	8.119776183348375
What is it?	7.424324335348126
What’s the trouble?	15.731102842884363
Wait awhile.	9.402923036860178
With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.	8.593050580741199
—Chow! he said.	4.010493067021081
Blast you! —The dust from those sacks, J.	8.76277815522642
O’Molloy said politely.	15.664036975476652
—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a...	7.14628884072074
cold night before...	2.9136467560195607
blast your soul...	2.868525433867597
night before last...	3.409902090978115
He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...	6.55579904837042
—I was...	3.5622053268494223
Glasnevin this morning...	2.879592589332979
poor little...	2.676549190970223
what do you call him...	4.346273273726203
Chow!...	2.511983141848314
—See?	13.563486119325157
he said.	3.3900725752648877
Say it’s turn six.	12.413191890464322
In here, see.	7.360240411872448
Turn Now On. He slid it into the left slot for them.	7.729727382135477
It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.	5.854964134793182
Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.	7.950470621296293
—See?	13.563486119325157
he said.	3.3900725752648877
See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.	11.57494482445189
The impact.	14.949365283168918
Leverage, see?	9.211411487310611
He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.	6.759304536749414
—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling.	10.060484657753076
So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.	10.06247971710973
—See?	13.563486119325157
Tom Rochford said.	4.187852482540215
He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four.	8.155049829324453
Turn Now On. —I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him.	9.840557740081975
One good turn deserves another.	6.867738524574245
—Do, Tom Rochford said.	5.637368903442298
Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.	12.348441344742033
—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly.	8.61275160363954
When you two begin...	4.18129706773009
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.	7.227920552197104
—But how does it work here, Tommy?	17.307671147691078
he asked.	5.571194519539272
—Tooraloo, Lenehan said.	3.3601244288536263
See you later.	13.73859965839755
He followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.	8.96275941950551
—He’s a hero, he said simply.	13.219253852061877
—I know, M’Coy said.	6.577772057609361
The drain, you mean.	9.503259052148508
—Drain?	17.17289249749927
Lenehan said.	3.3474808235333455
It was down a manhole.	17.935873033941114
They passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.	8.7011744089135
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was.	8.385099915245869
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas.	13.274165059203805
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and all, with the rope round him.	9.438385749960187
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.	10.797607634406853
—The act of a hero, he said.	9.602943853887535
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.	6.032797680291107
—This way, he said, walking to the right.	10.697188067039638
I want to pop into Lynam’s to see Sceptre’s starting price.	14.607868345608823
What’s the time by your gold watch and chain?	13.20357359229586
M’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s clock.	10.617914280315112
—After three, he said.	5.337348383864564
Who’s riding her?	18.144818235237334
—O.	7.941241255644802
Madden, Lenehan said.	4.97639935016904
And a game filly she is.	6.496154889133848
While he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter.	11.143389963005236
Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.	8.486293900636486
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.	16.4926099695258
—Even money, Lenehan said returning.	11.043873593924646
I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an earthly.	11.257791638239308
Through here.	5.336865107850044
They went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch.	12.757350012505256
A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker’s cart.	12.346100900307738
—There he is, Lenehan said.	6.16367230994432
—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.	11.202050335319583
—_Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye,_ Lenehan said.	8.939874384684364
—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said.	6.503119194227044
I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob.	15.126920552260994
There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails.	11.29841913563731
Astronomy it was about.	10.004105948531747
Lenehan laughed.	8.668454926516358
—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said.	7.828418422719183
Come over in the sun.	9.75387329858621
They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.	14.134432121930155
Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.	10.57316410164032
—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly.	11.81312264055345
The annual dinner, you know.	6.217398260984457
Boiled shirt affair.	9.467977617474897
The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music.	9.404961260183908
Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...	3.989497526106407
—I know, M’Coy broke in.	9.708163713294965
—Did she?	13.711983227768922
Lenehan said.	3.3474808235333455
A card _Unfurnished Apartments_ reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.	7.394819625728791
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.	9.515634851136666
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	6.453610626087193
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher.	7.460591732165081
Bloom and the wife were there.	10.48725651078714
Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice.	7.973411379323363
Fast and furious it was.	5.858367637008421
Cold joints galore and mince pies...	2.762535533027218
—I know, M’Coy said.	6.577772057609361
The year the missus was there...	3.511125283892472
Lenehan linked his arm warmly.	12.528554410130296
—But wait till I tell you, he said.	6.453610626087193
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the morning after the night before.	12.448973613382684
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s night on the Featherbed Mountain.	15.147070134216758
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other.	13.598601750901944
We started singing glees and duets: _Lo, the early beam of morning_.	7.139844714763321
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband.	15.214210832969414
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me.	6.924451412430353
Hell’s delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her.	12.487116292638433
Like that.	4.998933309707568
He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning: —I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time.	8.645049540239587
Know what I mean?	13.998839631576264
His hands moulded ample curves of air.	7.099674660771912
He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.	11.937482337746316
—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh.	13.231932627611547
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot.	14.391871189561858
But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way.	11.709389497354971
He knows them all, faith.	11.352852473523876
At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away.	5.0086051585427125
_And what star is that, Poldy?_ says she.	9.720677459677423
By God, she had Bloom cornered.	13.93532490815529
_That one, is it?_ says Chris Callinan, _sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick._ By God, he wasn’t far wide of the mark.	12.569652845560219
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.	8.841134916148711
—I’m weak, he gasped.	21.388855804842592
M’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave.	10.707176173999175
Lenehan walked on again.	6.6855970071524515
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly.	6.915160912085003
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.	11.313128729595853
—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously.	12.993412622612702
He’s not one of your common or garden...	7.382829149958516
you know...	2.7340362385993706
There’s a touch of the artist about old Bloom.	10.917117851026973
* * * Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of _The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk_, then of Aristotle’s _Masterpiece._ Crooked botched print.	8.610053284113569
Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.	6.716214689432378
Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world.	10.963516974232974
All butting with their skulls to get out of it.	7.3234195845710035
Child born every minute somewhere.	7.3074238797115525
Mrs Purefoy.	10.175459993809895
He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: _Tales of the Ghetto_ by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.	10.573343584312465
—That I had, he said, pushing it by.	9.459251693895002
The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.	8.645755705416427
—Them are two good ones, he said.	4.488450483384812
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.	14.83188274321689
He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.	10.210773223142244
On O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.	7.562869507388551
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	18.222970934888654
_Fair Tyrants_ by James Lovebirch.	9.657028365649833
Know the kind that is.	6.181039075157057
Had it?	6.470732668478746
He opened it.	4.292361584289976
Thought so.	7.001174124681293
A woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain.	13.512678815887938
Listen: the man.	8.522057025788762
No: she wouldn’t like that much.	13.393170540782652
Got her it once.	7.345525529775507
He read the other title: _Sweets of Sin_.	11.649428422132635
More in her line.	14.379816156363566
Let us see.	7.623156300166571
He read where his finger opened.	15.225658164798972
_—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies.	10.653114499508316
For him! For Raoul!_ Yes.	11.376218343790455
This.	22.307214335724723
Here.	12.056869439375285
Try.	32.172570290454246
—_Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé._ Yes.	9.1842037601634
Take this.	7.707440706491812
The end.	8.129015801942431
—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.	14.549734384174249
The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint.	6.939586728236968
Mr Bloom read again: _The beautiful woman._ Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh.	8.882725408968332
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up.	4.150257319567517
His nostrils arched themselves for prey.	7.27459621509224
Melting breast ointments (_for him! For Raoul!_).	6.377210831024059
Armpits’ oniony sweat.	9.423909758419015
Fishgluey slime (_her heaving embonpoint!_).	5.26359768974079
Feel! Press! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions! Young! Young! An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.	8.552856185267247
Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains.	10.769318639010493
The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing.	13.596144888099245
He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor.	6.93662031299652
He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.	9.123777703676396
Mr Bloom beheld it.	9.33092623114116
Mastering his troubled breath, he said: —I’ll take this one.	8.395585349347474
The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.	8.57812551496663
That’s a good one.	9.220772289763714
* * * The lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.	15.316733769585916
Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within.	15.196343613215367
Four and nine.	7.755604156648043
Those lovely curtains.	11.018554931211808
Five shillings.	7.7438334340113775
Cosy curtains.	10.454216610316093
Selling new at two guineas.	8.884584370266465
Any advance on five shillings?	10.75122556044848
Going for five shillings.	7.195437836474691
The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it: —Barang! Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.	10.184200790889824
A.	9.56954361575378
Jackson, W.	5.917702370263492
E.	10.594970405422256
Wylie, A.	5.8557691366686795
T.	11.481841078558022
Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.	9.530373368863822
Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row.	11.957019365077127
He halted near his daughter.	11.309538053559352
—It’s time for you, she said.	7.855316367449476
—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.	9.670787028921795
Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder?	14.39514895046713
Melancholy God! Dilly shrugged her shoulders.	7.3158255289031295
Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.	12.773842101708288
—Stand up straight, girl, he said.	4.769409985062612
You’ll get curvature of the spine.	19.448471861065592
Do you know what you look like?	18.774503713576454
He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.	10.026117210426698
—Give it up, father, Dilly said.	7.000985854063512
All the people are looking at you.	8.641487623275356
Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.	10.946517675396972
—Did you get any money?	15.85885676966415
Dilly asked.	5.295771030513646
—Where would I get money?	17.689720106345234
Mr Dedalus said.	3.7898625602284635
There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.	13.897404038003291
—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.	10.047258603098085
—How do you know that?	11.102184801209164
Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.	19.767673834700233
Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James’s street.	9.103274377546768
—I know you did, Dilly answered.	12.86634925914128
Were you in the Scotch house now?	12.778759573550495
—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling.	13.78068205196876
Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy?	17.011422670572777
Here.	12.056869439375285
He handed her a shilling.	15.706612210433033
—See if you can do anything with that, he said.	8.170613706100454
—I suppose you got five, Dilly said.	8.583895248429583
Give me more than that.	8.397340369007342
—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly.	14.74876331773361
You’re like the rest of them, are you?	11.006964545234247
An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died.	7.647842709809742
But wait awhile.	11.613593922820927
You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from me.	11.347541550540761
Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you.	8.473931641355975
Wouldn’t care if I was stretched out stiff.	18.363801374285504
He’s dead.	12.267383433067671
The man upstairs is dead.	8.088496746089211
He left her and walked on.	8.431105689625863
Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.	8.715964482653565
—Well, what is it?	8.539040756163226
he said, stopping.	17.652399836723337
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.	9.117283935550219
—Barang! —Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.	9.024819799400857
The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly: —Bang! Mr Dedalus stared at him.	7.7414488148623715
—Watch him, he said.	4.368284825144468
It’s instructive.	28.77550280749483
I wonder will he allow us to talk.	11.18944052130824
—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.	8.535538723256922
—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said.	10.70152304076562
I’ll leave you all where Jesus left the jews.	12.940418503722299
Look, there’s all I have.	9.369413865233065
He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.	9.35085630426578
—Can’t you look for some money somewhere?	16.726416622095186
Dilly said.	3.3050219522328192
Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.	13.621906195727322
—I will, he said gravely.	16.462529041459998
I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell street.	8.10508167368343
I’ll try this one now.	10.020312437398465
—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.	12.713662661381187
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something.	12.411436962558453
I’ll be home shortly.	13.880448120760143
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.	11.159356124831655
The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.	10.113112329958755
—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.	7.8612233061866394
The lacquey banged loudly.	8.639433388198425
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently: —The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything! O, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica! * * * From the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street, past Shackleton’s offices.	10.6316002726078
Got round him all right.	9.173234631720304
How do you do, Mr Crimmins?	18.734660656407044
First rate, sir.	5.138953770625559
I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico.	17.080796539346714
How are things going?	13.224071037824045
Just keeping alive.	8.11235109783578
Lovely weather we’re having.	15.729338880474524
Yes, indeed.	18.2733569909357
Good for the country.	14.208020944320864
Those farmers are always grumbling.	9.85594854270505
A small gin, sir.	4.757732245844722
Yes, sir.	7.445076455313322
Terrible affair that _General Slocum_ explosion.	7.0964940661043485
Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties.	11.906293198063256
And heartrending scenes.	11.316877381572302
Men trampling down women and children.	7.015375561128016
Most brutal thing.	6.504210791247886
What do they say was the cause?	25.171490189259686
Spontaneous combustion.	11.144207781784782
Most scandalous revelation.	11.353206093770492
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst.	11.019993556302996
What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that...	5.852614197176146
Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.	16.85988314054455
You know why?	18.42540087698318
Palm oil.	10.613172498221152
Without a doubt.	10.498866113915541
Well now, look at that.	7.77323135898957
And America they say is the land of the free.	12.615329915751813
I thought we were bad here.	9.987340209242221
I smiled at him.	5.3658439735200085
_America,_ I said quietly, just like that.	10.26327942630402
_What is it?	6.345338715254146
The sweepings of every country including our own.	6.687458525031032
Isn’t that true?_ That’s a fact.	11.722652254356326
Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s always someone to pick it up.	11.130588050655188
Saw him looking at my frockcoat.	14.512752031364323
Nothing like a dressy appearance.	13.281850906757576
Bowls them over.	6.424551895337501
—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	5.066017227839178
How are things?	15.307806929821108
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	10.828357499569488
Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser.	10.473638446918182
Stylish coat, beyond a doubt.	7.9735962159656335
Scott of Dawson street.	5.151255113226663
Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it.	6.928185520629658
Never built under three guineas.	8.309300727456037
Fits me down to the ground.	10.33625047022899
Some Kildare street club toff had it probably.	7.643193494257611
John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.	10.667696103549723
Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows.	9.35043826806594
Knight of the road.	13.193516146501844
Gentleman.	32.172570290454246
And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir.	11.276766780557352
The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.	7.433757679474129
North wall and sir John Rogerson’s quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.	9.957692170838868
Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image.	13.372701693258453
High colour, of course.	6.80518956272586
Grizzled moustache.	9.585045947163097
Returned Indian officer.	10.186724176764463
Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders.	5.4894798754310585
Is that Ned Lambert’s brother over the way, Sam?	18.400774282852993
He’s as like it as damn it.	8.140717722506121
No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there.	12.315117940241617
Just a flash like that.	7.111729343711105
Damn like him.	4.310476381658972
Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath.	7.168449053898981
Good drop of gin, that was.	5.826674850023844
His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.	9.912635440600328
Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered.	7.728504316873221
Greasy black rope.	10.332418200944243
Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant’s wife drove by in her noddy.	14.572646758669512
Bad times those were.	7.7413131298356195
Well, well.	12.617642246457576
Over and done with.	8.641443223994331
Fourbottle men.	7.229025978407323
Let me see.	7.032851054375647
Is he buried in saint Michan’s?	11.007667770880007
Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin.	12.205605882374547
Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall.	11.817913028661572
Dignam is there now.	6.816212202364527
Went out in a puff.	18.558112644168034
Well, well.	12.617642246457576
Better turn down here.	5.282052889884508
Make a detour.	15.952670113696488
Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness’s visitors’ waitingroom.	13.152337888960393
Outside the Dublin Distillers Company’s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel.	11.376257986794565
Damn dangerous thing.	6.504210791247886
Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens.	10.082401352884258
Runaway horse.	9.650211672574493
Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton’s office, led his wife over O’Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.	10.05107971381366
Mr Kernan approached Island street.	7.1223937226135
Times of the troubles.	23.98361997777676
Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington.	7.851226077694384
When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement.	16.627476836279037
Gaming at Daly’s.	4.470481142779806
No cardsharping then.	5.39036661798839
One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger.	19.273734954230093
Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr.	7.362125148398984
Stables behind Moira house.	5.59166866747607
Damn good gin that was.	5.273535695597984
Fine dashing young nobleman.	8.341289820540274
Good stock, of course.	6.783630488189967
Course they were on the wrong side.	14.045490655510136
They rose in dark and evil days.	7.400044278401496
Fine poem that is: Ingram.	12.511579922555514
They were gentlemen.	14.28356092681516
Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly.	12.561222827581744
Masterly rendition.	14.833002552262101
_At the siege of Ross did my father fall._ A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles.	6.85269629608422
Frockcoats.	32.172570290454246
Cream sunshades.	12.378863073457003
Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.	14.145421592410472
His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair.	7.405144762090355
Damn it! What a pity! * * * Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary’s fingers prove a timedulled chain.	9.531579626671995
Dust webbed the window and the showtrays.	13.36447137926062
Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails.	8.60818723397401
Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.	5.6740092004822635
Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness.	11.190067612054138
Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows.	9.272067246933844
Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.	4.21388999972674
She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic.	8.557294838023699
A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her.	4.984411025381328
A long and seafed silent rut.	8.715837743890544
She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.	7.667018827934197
Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses’ beard.	11.252859813976544
Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.	10.511155751338919
And you who wrest old images from the burial earth?	14.627976955479621
The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes.	8.136846964408631
A lore of drugs.	9.334542190512476
Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.	6.9774412983375775
Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife’s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.	12.399108412755622
The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on.	5.91423586360054
Beingless beings.	12.570867676935075
Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within.	11.106121906921253
Your heart you sing of.	6.143224314866482
I between them.	4.990340601249739
Where?	14.052664453048125
Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.	5.359519571489183
Shatter them, one and both.	12.225752786399388
Shatter me you who can.	9.945273732655318
Bawd and butcher were the words.	7.621017240608162
I say! Not yet awhile.	10.148656215311997
A look around.	9.594524903916033
Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time.	4.647286767064106
A Monday morning, ’twas so, indeed.	8.770659302591717
Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade.	14.157292630574755
In Clohissey’s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye.	6.589276821203746
Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering.	7.963610259924665
The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists.	6.309350253134757
And they are throbbing: heroes’ hearts.	10.40513698159863
He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.	14.223331491687583
—Twopence each, the huckster said.	7.002418113588057
Four for sixpence.	8.895279945940214
Tattered pages.	11.474648198318723

_Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti._ Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.	7.773149869498489
Binding too good probably.	6.471538346887932
What is this?	15.51964184640021
Eighth and ninth book of Moses.	9.284333627317102
Secret of all secrets.	18.178506172456107

Say the following talisman three times with hands folded: —_Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen._ Who wrote this?	6.337318239917527
Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged.	9.2820928210347
As good as any other abbot’s charms, as mumbling Joachim’s.	10.702705289243402
Down, baldynoddle, or we’ll wool your wool.	10.956737531175929
—What are you doing here, Stephen?	16.72538457329053
Dilly’s high shoulders and shabby dress.	11.194028540395218
Shut the book quick.	11.25683327948254
Don’t let see.	10.4773236874806
—What are you doing?	22.284060068582363
Stephen said.	3.3990640623497015
A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides.	6.535967908734378
It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots.	7.443610110194171
I told her of Paris.	8.938682194276447
Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly’s token.	8.528445970642123
_Nebrakada femininum._ —What have you there?	14.45285465578889
Stephen asked.	5.479503230507703
—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously.	17.098515612044903
Is it any good?	18.05641379157422
My eyes they say she has.	12.664017281753068
Do others see me so?	10.944000877885989
Quick, far and daring.	11.872786885522066
Shadow of my mind.	11.77289235334425
He took the coverless book from her hand.	8.62384381313988
Chardenal’s French primer.	19.444811994786818
—What did you buy that for?	18.253913003941783
he asked.	5.571194519539272
To learn French?	17.51059908133912
She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.	5.136191082327306
Show no surprise.	8.586415177084804
Quite natural.	11.505338535912102
It’s all right.	7.745559458195826
Mind Maggy doesn’t pawn it on you.	8.096314842296897
I suppose all my books are gone.	9.287986318317493
—Some, Dilly said.	3.7920969967720364
We had to.	6.450657948660857
She is drowning.	17.238921403782633
Agenbite.	25.535385961793953
Save her.	4.892668042093682
Agenbite.	25.535385961793953
She will drown me with her, eyes and hair.	9.146295786035681
Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul.	10.847777887959303
Salt green death.	6.376131993607558
We. Agenbite of inwit.	8.152640037726922
Inwit’s agenbite.	30.76398896174718
Misery! Misery! * * * —Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said.	5.725131371549508
How are things?	15.307806929821108
—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.	10.828357499569488
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.	8.87137103234035
Mr Dedalus said.	3.7898625602284635
—Why then not much, Father Cowley said.	6.313986844459234
I’m barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.	15.653181441045573
—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said.	4.228090955866448
Who is it?	8.452407460679394
—O, Father Cowley said.	6.193533617551128
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.	13.718088020901794
—With a broken back, is it?	10.08490667478028
—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered.	11.791883897326262
Reuben of that ilk.	19.287099108322927
I’m just waiting for Ben Dollard.	12.330715783093487
He’s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off.	12.693989118299607
All I want is a little time.	11.534086038932461
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.	11.437311297554674
—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding.	14.591910711340986
Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always doing a good turn for someone.	11.718449928199577
Hold hard! He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.	13.138743460272986
Ben Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge.	8.027614705515749
He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.	10.006348140071127
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted: —Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.	16.559419098339653
—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.	6.87915428765584
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard’s figure.	10.974595214446609
Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly: —That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?	14.304618723428842
—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.	10.4770480850061
He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying: —They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.	13.355325565461126
—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said.	9.146229198934302
Thanks be to God he’s not paid yet.	10.0958064685028
—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	15.205339768175737
Father Cowley asked.	8.866087311155422
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.	6.519804879086675
Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a deep note.	12.207508507344393
—Aw! he said.	3.6706390910234306
—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.	11.297657009550974
—What about that?	12.661432148287284
Ben Dollard said.	4.298208717799206
Not too dusty?	16.239760990182177
He turned to both.	12.27234565575195
—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.	13.9263832676551
The reverend Hugh C.	6.019247447289253
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.	8.181064839023428
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.	10.988604351614754
—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said.	9.808873560622542
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff.	16.523197052145903
He’s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun.	9.96911891737824
He’s well worth seeing, mind you.	8.665340680159808
Come along.	11.04908873456675
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don’t...	9.164663552237824
Wait awhile...	2.5900596967231486
We’re on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.	9.437117055925466
—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.	14.340115419811692
Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.	12.359956929489849
—What few days?	25.881586859494337
he boomed.	14.949365283168918
Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?	10.964237596838776
—He has, Father Cowley said.	5.842254346749642
—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben Dollard said.	10.95670678365162
The landlord has the prior claim.	10.154259919582415
I gave him all the particulars.	18.005818064595992
29 Windsor avenue.	8.156759304549212
Love is the name?	14.141156626180921
—That’s right, Father Cowley said.	7.232838533317497
The reverend Mr Love.	13.599253860864547
He’s a minister in the country somewhere.	14.757965527235637
But are you sure of that?	10.355653694508355
He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.	14.031504891032638
—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.	9.356966018808919
* * * —The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.	13.378533051825608
The policeman touched his forehead.	8.72499445238643
—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.	16.914222461939925
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.	9.192609454763678
Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.	12.005235124653181
—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard.	11.873133793374118
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.	7.849087004469539
—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.	14.660004874448562
—Boyd?	18.280183293229488
Martin Cunningham said shortly.	15.328118275080994
Touch me not.	7.8917799196822225
John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.	7.733786827602347
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.	5.131835023917617
—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the _Mail_ office.	12.727815968748402
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.	11.162119548597845
—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list.	10.328937961721225
And put down the five shillings too.	8.662397598577716
—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.	6.375723887664739
—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.	8.050339570096599
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.	7.4488253396762785
—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.	15.459666737674079
They went down Parliament street.	8.420884149976345
—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.	9.52949095436607
—Righto, Martin Cunningham said.	3.869746455866199
Outside _la Maison Claire_ Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.	9.012492852836903
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.	12.980042599003369
—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.	10.983425166121659
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate.	7.1327696443708035
Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.	8.856600361653806
—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.	11.237266386158915
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.	11.285077144664392
—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.	12.023156532348716
Long John Fanning made no way for them.	6.897530961247948
He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.	9.15336177674726
—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations?	6.710337149007513
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.	12.749852428542336
Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language.	7.8926342060619215
Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber.	19.361545896083573
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing _locum tenens_ for him.	9.289627321585254
Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.	11.118569699167521
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.	8.695063095907534
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.	10.175560381170964
—What Dignam was that?	11.902921180211825
long John Fanning asked.	7.3634101755493475
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.	12.499502087594196
—O, my corns! he said plaintively.	18.73581801816474
Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till I sit down somewhere.	8.932817920833992
Uff! Ooo! Mind! Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and passed in and up the stairs.	9.840224258626382
—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff.	14.699904668681382
I don’t think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.	11.455261553460884
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.	8.550029388047609
—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.	10.359916350474329
—Rather lowsized.	12.87437384787828
Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham said.	7.242840218676312
Long John Fanning could not remember him.	7.5427847125496275
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.	6.931237397796164
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
Martin Cunningham said.	3.677401538730519
All turned where they stood.	10.694362497143981
John Wyse Nolan came down again.	8.560996893029158
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering.	11.106481131712103
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly.	9.941997136949544
—What was it?	10.457526462515135
Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.	14.851740554510418
—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.	12.169971388502773
* * * As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines: —Parnell’s brother.	12.278046180003024
There in the corner.	12.081619765043447
They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.	8.038636528259428
—Is that he?	11.751206606064605
Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.	13.902716496533708
—Yes, Mulligan said.	6.368158110443711
That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.	14.894275014526311
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested.	10.765508941102828
An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.	10.32790979535126
—I’ll take a _mélange,_ Haines said to the waitress.	16.46245676581752
—Two _mélanges,_ Buck Mulligan said.	6.234865667338819
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.	7.857712099061675
When she had gone he said, laughing: —We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes.	17.774998173658688
O, but you missed Dedalus on _Hamlet._ Haines opened his newbought book.	8.452107189444952
—I’m sorry, he said.	6.21539237551087
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.	12.97330607823886
The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street: —_England expects_...	8.280953909200942
Buck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.	13.475367277142777
—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance.	12.174198795680578
Wandering Ængus I call him.	4.639953892933923
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be.	13.562182659712809
Such persons always have.	5.992526833409671
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.	18.112993076812064
—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell.	10.59925147838767
He will never capture the Attic note.	7.911711084854646
The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth.	12.226055760475981
That is his tragedy.	18.825795899721662
He can never be a poet.	14.699904158397086
The joy of creation...	3.1464986189278052
—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly.	9.781705344409065
I see.	5.865550534154977
I tackled him this morning on belief.	9.861517263440025
There was something on his mind, I saw.	16.831457357137165
It’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.	7.235641034274625
Buck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come.	12.11367745457326
He helped her to unload her tray.	8.897665671273568
—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups.	9.860177818927339
The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution.	11.243677975937056
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea.	8.99581214948908
Does he write anything for your movement?	14.831729333328532
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.	8.318690780067467
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith.	8.301365015922734
He bit off a soft piece hungrily.	13.466062517537727
—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing.	9.720827270099464
He is going to write something in ten years.	13.317303638672401
—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.	11.837016548383005
Still, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.	14.484645944113836
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.	11.203141493290923
—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance.	11.207576607213678
I don’t want to be imposed on.	10.855391202591504
Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	6.752043842436826
* * * Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.	12.381119584785537
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.	11.902475012951015
Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.	9.990123424665661
At the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke’s lawn.	14.005609037294752
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	7.675266048243168
With ratsteeth bared he muttered: —_Coactus volui._ He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.	9.13762327559161
As he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body.	8.474569566382973
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.	8.724013185642178
—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor I am, you bitch’s bastard! * * * Opposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling.	11.0487207450759
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.	10.385744171625896
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.	10.277500484676752
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him.	4.971157907169659
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props.	12.843122237284458
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently.	7.585482181551892
Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns.	10.356352318055519
Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see.	11.922719262569151
Myler Keogh, that’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash.	12.897150529211729
I could easy do a bunk on ma.	12.363678779814958
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned.	15.351363879941886
That’s me in mourning.	13.673011789922947
When is it?	7.046730049903726
May the twentysecond.	14.405000776322408
Sure, the blooming thing is all over.	12.00577121462433
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up.	13.233171480903996
Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers.	11.40596057581255
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.	10.979250652128762
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on.	8.431891445464569
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons.	9.542004209382386
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man.	9.915305339188118
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.	7.114863065546896
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.	12.774118671063006
No Sandymount tram.	8.211195623572625
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand.	8.110494837516693
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down.	9.39264714751212
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it.	8.478583683630317
He met schoolboys with satchels.	9.587790448349816
I’m not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday.	11.126128681004635
He met other schoolboys.	10.034884035775905
Do they notice I’m in mourning?	12.432981844657812
Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.	13.731088010795041
Then they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s name.	12.114187613637474
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye.	10.99599002383863
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.	12.806218312864871

—Is that her?	13.53318051666575
asked miss Kennedy.	9.889926772512046
Miss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and _eau de Nil._ —Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.	8.829909157936486
When all agog miss Douce said eagerly: —Look at the fellow in the tall silk.	13.929916964668639
—Who?	11.362660442813608
Where?	14.052664453048125

Mind till I see.	7.082920935159988
She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.	9.436963715375164
Her wet lips tittered: —He’s killed looking back.	8.53310874339762
She laughed: —O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?	12.897898040898276
With sadness.	14.509135749322695
Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear.	7.22971031553374
Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.	8.06900562002591
Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.	6.311777921090487
—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.	7.122250285603835
A man.	6.197971481656976
The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came.	10.311347141705273
For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china.	10.001614272136901
And —There’s your teas, he said.	6.219856466285134
Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.	6.951943052540045
—What is it?	8.031263818381309
loud boots unmannerly asked.	4.681477868402417
—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.	10.459769068761986
—Your _beau,_ is it?	7.3134079459228305

Ladylike in exquisite contrast.	9.975770955514712
—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.	11.252066960069433
She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea.	16.140272675595387
They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.	8.748331503456518
Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.	10.613287670092333
—Am I awfully sunburnt?	12.087716204952537
Miss bronze unbloused her neck.	6.302495420690413
—No, said miss Kennedy.	14.124232108338475
It gets brown after.	6.241311027909667
Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?	12.423254329813437
Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.	10.28599486096142
—And leave it to my hands, she said.	9.613179075987672
—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.	13.512253866227482
Bidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce —Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated.	7.995403623031589
I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.	10.959981148182912
Miss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed: —O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake! —But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.	12.181932149801892
Sweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.	7.41768843022654
—No, don’t, she cried.	9.441968526441753
—I won’t listen, she cried.	13.787912267604288
But Bloom?	11.902884080328652
Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone: —For your what?	11.428741411842582
says he.	5.925124930617523
Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again: —Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire.	15.28722213365511
The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.	11.936812231401108
She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.	7.167211432039893
—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings.	9.31208903505693
Hufa! Hufa! Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat.	9.400163387115649
Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.	7.843753175491453
—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried.	10.744966111402306
Will you ever forget his goggle eye?	12.456249307137483
Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting: —And your other eye! Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name.	8.17117907370843
Why do I always think Figather?	17.505256865482743
Gathering figs, I think.	7.6815770875380665
And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.	9.855889552143699
By Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by.	11.751042215951463
Bluerobed, white under, come to me.	7.889662739417476
God they believe she is: or goddess.	12.865142295570497
Those today.	6.468988669688199
I could not see.	10.296664325394818
That fellow spoke.	10.927189807442346
A student.	9.175398092422556
After with Dedalus’ son.	6.997720073401192
He might be Mulligan.	13.28297956189195
All comely virgins.	8.366224671884627
That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.	7.120155605958283
By went his eyes.	5.208701739969608
The sweets of sin.	6.663083873678027
Sweet are the sweets.	12.311053609214351
Of sin.	9.197336705875335
In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye.	5.7505846054425875
They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.	9.505422609586816
Ah, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.	7.68261797971098
Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled.	8.748412013521852
Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying: —O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.	8.217289595243255
With his bit of beard! Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.	9.358255109712886
—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.	13.532539426541318
Shrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter.	7.000912363177589
And then laughed more.	9.130607277836573
Greasy I knows.	9.403448825602728
Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge.	6.736869361530523
Married to Bloom, to greaseabloom.	16.75793168807699
—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.	11.143875834725314
I wished I hadn’t laughed so much.	10.351009804635734
I feel all wet.	13.666502639529096
—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested.	15.012590501615303
You horrid thing! And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.	10.44548993812015
By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of their oils.	14.08872006616423
Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I.	7.363478699313387
Religion pays.	12.621260247635798
Must see him for that par.	17.65370167339978
Eat first.	6.50596300780374
I want.	11.117248746379309
At four, she said.	4.693906865478461
Time ever passing.	9.048380303852854
Clockhands turning.	9.631288665095335
On. Where eat?	13.968536414410979
The Clarence, Dolphin.	8.904481373980948
On. For Raoul.	12.370163123325808
If I net five guineas with those ads.	10.350874107408398
The violet silk petticoats.	9.5344924541154
The sweets of sin.	6.663083873678027
Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.	9.147794599134762
Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus.	7.014575949671085
Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails.	12.146587132176892
Chips.	25.535385961793953
He strolled.	16.21372629447159
—O, welcome back, miss Douce.	14.70266599859963
He held her hand.	7.774309331348012
Enjoyed her holidays?	13.721172662045706
—Tiptop.	14.949365283168918
He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.	9.906738910243826
—Gorgeous, she said.	3.608175334314682
Look at the holy show I am.	14.864518190975167
Lying out on the strand all day.	10.174757138371442
Bronze whiteness.	12.378863073457003
—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently.	14.849307661426854
Tempting poor simple males.	8.393465969519312
Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.	5.853176234622986
—O go away! she said.	7.312268196439749
You’re very simple, I don’t think.	11.385312456161857
He was.	6.599852827601158
—Well now I am, he mused.	19.441981662054506
I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.	10.448743604353634
—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer.	10.124219971249259
And what did the doctor order today?	12.969350465134138
I think I’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.	15.894189301683657
Jingle.	22.307214335724723
—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.	9.936760169633542
With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself.	9.021373837365775
With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg.	9.174435302213835
Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.	13.784806366325924
Alacrity she served.	8.999781762327117
He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.	9.89211218870321
—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains.	14.873008174539141
Must be a great tonic in the air down there.	12.836978441752223
But a long threatening comes at last, they say.	9.10513107800046
He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the bowl.	11.698021875581746
Chips.	25.535385961793953
Shreds.	32.172570290454246
Musing.	32.172570290454246
Mute.	32.172570290454246
None nought said nothing.	6.323689088867898
Gaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling: —_O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!_ —Was Mr Lidwell in today?	10.706340573980338
In came Lenehan.	8.169518068956387
Round him peered Lenehan.	6.5922117914617875
Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge.	12.646636421566047
Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex.	15.037894991230845
To Martha I must write.	11.25426206079255
Buy paper.	7.103459739132123
Daly’s.	4.980475362778415
Girl there civil.	11.936487765435038
Bloom.	7.595351801251561
Old Bloom.	5.117806496024259
Blue bloom is on the rye.	14.673023954727272
—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.	6.685856121779697
Lenehan came forward.	8.66202399097289
—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?	12.039039737251006
He asked.	5.670210055907986
She answered: —Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?	15.267409009342815
She asked.	5.621765666472605
Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page: —No. He was not.	12.391168316069967
Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on.	7.71174507634919
Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.	8.08270132802649
—Peep! Who’s in the corner?	13.09271291309354
No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures.	9.326168469852018
To mind her stops.	8.863931614372756
To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.	7.825493013673797
Jingle jaunty jingle.	11.263313025732812
Girlgold she read and did not glance.	13.313961575907907
Take no notice.	10.063239623134828
She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly: —Ah fox met ah stork.	9.251002087057815
He droned in vain.	7.442275424816273
Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.	16.07476460741261
He sighed aside: —Ah me! O my! He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.	13.57514208066257
—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.	13.080414606411745
—Who may he be?	12.653146016961475
Lenehan opened most genial arms.	6.2716540553157145
Who?	12.76769298089698
—Who may he be?	12.653146016961475
he asked.	5.571194519539272
Can you ask?	24.34074274081999
Stephen, the youthful bard.	19.816117051346477
Dry.	32.172570290454246
Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.	11.385937649149193
—I see, he said.	6.015482327040246
I didn’t recognise him for the moment.	11.581348613229189
I hear he is keeping very select company.	10.919775511972066
Have you seen him lately?	17.224020299836127
He had.	8.828636818347034
—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.	12.630827358437132
In Mooney’s _en ville_ and in Mooney’s _sur mer._ He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.	16.60145845466454
He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes: —The _élite_ of Erin hung upon his lips.	11.86795242971594
The ponderous pundit, Hugh MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O’Madden Burke.	9.135820240783133
After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and —That must have been highly diverting, said he.	9.785478727827442
I see.	5.865550534154977
He see.	5.463510164118329
He drank.	13.891715978361024
With faraway mourning mountain eye.	5.213567083265656
Set down his glass.	11.307585755179252
He looked towards the saloon door.	12.68478416640713
—I see you have moved the piano.	14.751058148480313
—Is that a fact?	11.857896236260586
—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy?	15.249400701874816
The real classical, you know.	6.245268515285848
And blind too, poor fellow.	9.919074690433698
Not twenty I’m sure he was.	7.468501787620404
—Is that a fact?	11.857896236260586
Mr Dedalus said.	3.7898625602284635
He drank and strayed away.	6.093484386758427
—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.	14.19593750887661
God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.	17.832322620124174
Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.	12.666206960915396
To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.	9.795186647425334
Lager for diner.	12.310962901432042
Lager without alacrity she served.	7.203597374928705
With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.	7.051776297145628
Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires.	10.93814774592467
He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.	9.78791740450117
Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely’s wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought.	9.672556265125856
Are you not happy in your home?	13.711816895602778
Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo.	11.476285144750156
Means something, language of flow.	8.100692869922323
Was it a daisy?	18.9262147769492
Innocence that is.	5.213795739387887
Respectable girl meet after mass.	7.176318559684048
Thanks awfully muchly.	11.496877676124072
Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves.	8.191981300720375
Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all.	4.414370179769836
Hair streaming: lovelorn.	9.507159071685974
For some man.	5.671477291856249
For Raoul.	13.133563520851979
He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car.	8.123909168173187
It is.	5.625548601691804
Again.	20.267449269082853
Third time.	5.3424212932392585
Coincidence.	22.307214335724723
Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.	8.4292705632575
Follow.	32.172570290454246
Go quick.	9.261334374588328
At four.	8.758348520958476
Near now.	4.779330306107821
—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.	8.163565960508619
I was forgetting...	5.111053474154005
Excuse...	2.6475850980614206
—And four.	15.619185930022805
At four she.	8.158574191361685
Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled.	6.964243257306256
Bloo smi qui go.	5.9675141852496125
Ternoon.	32.172570290454246
Think you’re the only pebble on the beach?	15.589918575571861
Does that to all.	7.087230319729682
For men.	7.229025978407323
In drowsy silence gold bent on her page.	9.343110611174973
That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck.	16.68162042986327
A call again.	5.189946777556995
That he now poised that it now throbbed.	15.173670638112286
You hear?	14.387892402591925
It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs.	5.990982822233563
Longer in dying call.	7.551485604131132
Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss Douce.	9.036566831333541
—_The bright stars fade_...	3.919405767774422
A voiceless song sang from within, singing: —...	3.8070995279578264
Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.	11.313241868215497
—_The dewdrops pearl_...	3.2038333088254984
Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.	14.31701534900389
—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.	10.701520751689614
Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.	10.209915770930058
She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.	5.329650975194177
—Did she fall or was she pushed?	13.918295844283318
he asked her.	6.6847358286239755
She answered, slighting: —Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.	10.832225757600654
Like lady, ladylike.	12.283343855196948
Blazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.	15.283623704978032
Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar.	15.250205283778776
Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him: —See the conquering hero comes.	8.730753429366505
Between the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero.	10.807214407825125
See me he might.	10.179027908326873
The seat he sat on: warm.	10.305615222871413
Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.	8.427811918349876
—_And I from thee_...	2.8510635526007126
—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.	16.035797719986327
He touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw.	9.578390722948729
But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.	10.078369751975407
—What’s your cry?	19.025289838781617
Glass of bitter?	16.56156283443184
Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me.	6.359819124060288
Wire in yet?	12.714651777947104
At four she.	8.158574191361685
Who said four?	14.264970455843928
Cowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s office.	12.762020724929709
Avoid.	32.172570290454246
Goulding a chance.	8.914924525640807
What is he doing in the Ormond?	23.9643945147814
Car waiting.	10.70397704667392
Hello.	16.81846716713923
Where off to?	13.143088540732824
Something to eat?	16.660504801862533
I too was just.	12.650584936032738
In here.	5.577632757716354
What, Ormond?	19.49643582872391
Best value in Dublin.	7.789240615789742
Is that so?	14.436377073418738
Diningroom.	32.172570290454246
Sit tight there.	5.513574827245328
See, not be seen.	17.66154783715038
I think I’ll join you.	9.572984359669464
Come on.	5.866048127058964
Richie led on.	5.269123875573748
Bloom followed bag.	9.008778555944977
Dinner fit for a prince.	14.065928368371752
Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.	9.765566899381318
—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch.	13.488141629384511
O! But easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.	7.513481061618081
—Why don’t you grow?	17.999504458533323
asked Blazes Boylan.	8.327951838047115
Shebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice: —Fine goods in small parcels.	11.749538635064518
That is to say she.	11.857373288679378
Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.	9.125819550618587
—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.	8.668019946644565
He pitched a broad coin down.	5.399398216776684
Coin rang.	12.66325235834695
—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...	6.10471707349627
—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.	10.964716404932227
—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.	6.34878905277957
—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking.	11.228674071743303
Not on my own, you know.	9.529851861155565
Fancy of a friend of mine.	11.754852929150553
Lenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.	11.472209112501186
Idolores.	25.535385961793953
The eastern seas.	10.059253310478823
Clock whirred.	12.473018673646399
Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray.	10.903707246418609
Clock clacked.	11.144207781784782
Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister.	11.17939479193163
It clanged.	14.833002552262101
Clock clacked.	11.144207781784782
Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change.	8.650926599286082
A clack.	14.833002552262101
For me.	4.599893071517553
—What time is that?	11.888781338629554
asked Blazes Boylan.	8.327951838047115
Four?	32.172570290454246
O’clock.	20.782560545788336
Lenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan’s elbowsleeve.	10.505237075591252
—Let’s hear the time, he said.	7.564107958115069
The bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.	6.680665980482982
Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door.	7.811953085221679
Be near.	11.235284606527394
At four.	8.758348520958476
Perhaps a trick.	8.665472939513654
Not come: whet appetite.	8.241992654772265
I couldn’t do.	8.202176041833495
Wait, wait.	9.36826467827886
Pat, waiter, waited.	8.050386902283432
Sparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure’s skyblue bow and eyes.	7.673962089638169
—Go on, pressed Lenehan.	8.665752441992185
There’s no-one.	8.372207902238822
He never heard.	10.34644294369367
—...	2.6475850980614206
Bronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes Boylan’s flower and eyes.	8.026114003641942
He pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.	6.943484546410344
—_I could not leave thee_...	4.662958666108472
—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.	9.541146068006963
—No, now, urged Lenehan.	10.392432076154062
_Sonnez la cloche!_ O do! There’s no-one.	8.178346726065552
Miss Kenn out of earshot.	17.571813991215734
Sudden bent.	11.497114294136406
Two kindling faces watched her bend.	7.9329204741267825
Quavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.	12.789618075009436
—Go on! Do! _Sonnez!_ Bending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee.	9.712010173459307
Delayed.	32.172570290454246
Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.	7.074218011494548
_—Sonnez!_ Smack.	22.253169843378117
She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.	7.503566431016659
—_La cloche!_ cried gleeful Lenehan.	7.912123946507839
Trained by owner.	13.414199214096312
No sawdust there.	4.787992078129222
She smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.	7.302332393282234
—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.	5.216807959444557
Boylan, eyed, eyed.	11.951620663135545
Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops.	7.43388054957853
His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.	7.396715857651589
Yes, bronze from anearby.	21.852152316203437
—...	2.6475850980614206
_Sweetheart, goodbye!_ —I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.	10.939614462811754
He slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.	8.182072135990609
—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly.	8.352433075138569
I wanted to tell you.	7.649292350026828
Tom Rochford...	2.580855143167595
—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.	12.0849314301055
Lenehan gulped to go.	6.195867886190197
he said.	3.3900725752648877
I’m coming.	13.596165742049678
He followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.	12.621847997064844
—How do you do, Mr Dollard?	19.344861222228527
—Eh?	11.52577618932958
How do?	12.944684065963935
How do?	12.944684065963935
Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley’s woe.	14.611506163903211
He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.	11.826231153060181
Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow.	10.411862192539028
We’ll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.	11.807828776632274
Sighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.	13.283214055923455
—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily.	11.212098029382455
Come on, Simon.	10.39229732409371
Give us a ditty.	16.715676577606565
We heard the piano.	9.672761761105333
Power for Richie.	9.955573651963281
And Bloom?	13.97374012991453
Let me see.	7.032851054375647
Not make him walk twice.	9.415523816947996
His corns.	15.045831905306336
Four now.	4.779330306107821
How warm this black is.	4.80252711485122
Course nerves a bit.	6.716083203587977
Refracts (is it?) heat.	10.259973675691507
Let me see.	7.032851054375647
Cider.	32.172570290454246
Yes, bottle of cider.	18.409513664513092
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
Mr Dedalus said.	3.7898625602284635
I was only vamping, man.	9.230707444394366
—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called.	13.176796597598598
Come, Bob.	16.41007721498885
He ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon.	8.877336812612235
He plumped him Dollard on the stool.	11.669133615000872
His gouty paws plumped chords.	7.114710968185323
Plumped, stopped abrupt.	12.365527221403884
Bald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning.	11.683543118193942
Bothered, he wanted Power and cider.	14.869239376515425
Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.	10.854672185378941
Jingle a tinkle jaunted.	9.892888940511487
Bloom heard a jing, a little sound.	11.745219770030543
He’s off.	9.66335578876777
Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers.	8.79868261962415
Jingling.	32.172570290454246
He’s gone.	12.084080757245298
Jingle.	22.307214335724723
Hear.	32.172570290454246
—Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said.	4.874918458152869
God be with old times.	11.434115623736558
Miss Douce’s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight.	11.95551461132751
Gone.	17.705247751504768
Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord.	12.549758152418692
She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, _eau de Nil._ —Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them.	8.148040095213318
There was.	6.584832418917872
—A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said.	7.882523897565533
The devil wouldn’t stop him.	8.140273128431122
He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.	13.733550744219658
—God, do you remember?	19.072960600776558
Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard.	13.395694159873432
And by Japers I had no wedding garment.	11.356173043104695
They laughed all three.	7.672925795640902
He had no wed.	20.16092816409645
All trio laughed.	6.97501646267775
No wedding garment.	9.137217783776709
—Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said.	6.896874967227752
Where’s my pipe, by the way?	14.323213409907718
He wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe.	12.173987860029213
And Father Cowley laughed again.	8.384759313954003
—I saved the situation, Ben, I think.	10.701673180027047
—You did, averred Ben Dollard.	10.027406304594075
I remember those tight trousers too.	6.742832627401164
That was a brilliant idea, Bob.	14.597977864991446
Father Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes.	15.110956033329943
He saved the situa.	10.81167153328014
Tight trou.	14.509135749322695
Brilliant ide.	14.509135749322695
—I knew he was on the rocks, he said.	10.056072697562454
The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business?	14.179869210873795
Do you remember?	21.372094323960418
We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh’s gave us the number.	12.170052539176472
Remember?	32.172570290454246
—By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.	8.108652119032307
Mr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.	9.438641059508488
—Merrion square style.	9.111670292013004
Balldresses, by God, and court dresses.	14.592575780339928
He wouldn’t take any money either.	10.6226001798582
Any God’s quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose.	10.45476576944471
Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.	13.15141476835642
Jingle jaunted down the quays.	14.612053301461936
Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.	8.388689362222816
Liver and bacon.	14.21098325986822
Steak and kidney pie.	10.403639782777786
Right, sir.	6.542435444389132
Right, Pat.	13.794638989468686
Mrs Marion.	9.266061138508881
Met him pike hoses.	8.526362074150065
Smell of burn.	14.141579622598163
Of Paul de Kock.	10.288182561970318
Nice name he.	5.385383691982148
—What’s this her name was?	14.83893684642449
A buxom lassy.	10.53625214251107
Marion...	2.808462709161009
—Tweedy.	11.471557475985025
—Yes.	7.481096245794936
Is she alive?	16.2786015406643
—And kicking.	21.277905583918688
—She was a daughter of...	5.697432433950898
—Daughter of the regiment.	19.630024552377048
—Yes, begad.	19.452901266323433
I remember the old drummajor.	20.634727403399324
Mr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after —Irish?	7.460262121307438
I don’t know, faith.	10.053861058493881
Is she, Simon?	15.692925709987328
Puff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.	7.617560423243959
—Buccinator muscle is...	2.7151786007923198
What?...	2.588247333459426
Bit rusty...	2.4231998419027168
O, she is...	5.385657330120651
My Irish Molly, O.	6.876562612781161
He puffed a pungent plumy blast.	7.826567660956001
—From the rock of Gibraltar...	4.343708172265157
all the way.	11.824562307258022
They pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two.	6.570623182444508
Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.	8.611982957224887
Pat served, uncovered dishes.	9.359581178856898
Leopold cut liverslices.	11.737883115638748
As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods’ roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.	5.88817085342742
Bloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate.	8.84339201775467
Dinners fit for princes.	11.277906411510399
By Bachelor’s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare’s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold.	8.515424744227138
Horn.	20.267449269082853
Horn.	20.267449269082853
Haw haw horn.	9.887410554020875
Over their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords: —_When love absorbs my ardent soul_...	4.723930617397009
Roll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.	10.082189369289708
—War! War! cried Father Cowley.	8.100322701294813
You’re the warrior.	11.174173832192354
I was thinking of your landlord.	25.430306597104384
Love or money.	7.2782695569465155
He stopped.	9.01274940815039
He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.	8.7591673422661
—Sure, you’d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.	11.016169571621347
In bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard.	8.923130003948202
He would.	9.879909381285435
—Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added.	8.868829594195564
Half time, Ben.	11.157578927772501
_Amoroso ma non troppo._ Let me there.	6.145554828117129
Miss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout.	7.973683154500834
She passed a remark.	10.08065493879562
It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.	17.056267392038208
They drank cool stout.	7.655545592902177
Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?	12.845339964324562
And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring.	6.653495242288328
No, she couldn’t say.	14.119313348335027
But it would be in the paper.	12.543758378938106
O, she need not trouble.	18.515802828250305
She waved about her outspread _Independent,_ searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten.	10.541224331948298
Too much trouble, first gentleman said.	5.984921661151783
O, not in the least.	17.45357436620373
Way he looked that.	6.346325465044123
Lord lieutenant.	11.404596047844995
Gold by bronze heard iron steel.	7.713889059395795
—............	2.12997130020284
_my ardent soul I care not foror the morrow._ In liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes.	6.366739591020992
Love and War someone is.	5.529256169356992
Ben Dollard’s famous.	21.207099728001722
Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert.	10.968706206843736
Trousers tight as a drum on him.	7.233206760361544
Musical porkers.	14.509135749322695
Molly did laugh when he went out.	7.959465451835086
Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking.	8.883791361579933
With all his belongings on show.	8.10392535281647
O saints above, I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that’s what gives him the base barreltone.	11.948294281086227
For instance eunuchs.	17.124647542398133
Wonder who’s playing.	20.363559174930916
Nice touch.	9.629153990124436
Must be Cowley.	15.752507200832447
Musical.	32.172570290454246
Knows whatever note you play.	7.3154117270759365
Bad breath he has, poor chap.	8.860671545964061
Stopped.	32.172570290454246
Miss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering.	7.4739504971583965
She gave her moist (a lady’s) hand to his firm clasp.	13.497629149797731
To the old dingdong again.	13.213353487907895
—Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.	11.810197422532093
George Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.	7.917281187770197
Bloom ate liv as said before.	6.781535017308262
Clean here at least.	7.848006098403606
That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle.	9.416003423615082
No-one here: Goulding and I.	7.71273338094609
Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins.	5.614264596207146
Pat to and fro.	8.716943480953995
Bald Pat.	11.571781256704664
Nothing to do.	7.656102720718159
Best value in Dub.	8.293761618986593
Piano again.	5.364875352896063
Cowley it is.	5.172173591328579
Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding.	11.260715161073083
Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache.	6.678882187598911
Her high long snore.	11.22602306289563
Night we were in the box.	13.64152832129029
Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle.	7.307047771501561
Conductor’s legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy.	12.682289724536904
Do right to hide them.	7.8563012279278
Jiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.	8.664263345140993
Only the harp.	15.722313876132295
Lovely.	32.172570290454246
Gold glowering light.	6.863343020774351
Girl touched it.	3.885876693898791
Poop of a lovely.	16.2722005386645
Gravy’s rather good fit for a.	10.926177811315618
Golden ship.	10.007187103961416
The harp that once or twice.	7.588977537462592
Cool hands.	6.369743715298307
Ben Howth, the rhododendrons.	17.686764566442722
We are their harps.	16.319830782263136
I.	7.73347927951542
He. Old.	13.748880147739472
Young.	32.172570290454246
—Ah, I couldn’t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.	10.856206620666462
Strongly.	32.172570290454246
—Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled.	12.874604369343523
Get it out in bits.	12.893323792630776
—_M’appari,_ Simon, Father Cowley said.	5.16542293071568
Down stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld.	8.041969837180732
Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly.	11.18687553335538
Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: _A Last Farewell._ A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows.	13.082404834853206
Farewell.	22.307214335724723
A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.	9.546893496447602
—Go on, Simon.	9.068625947278925
—Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben...	6.5111515212649556
Well...	2.748300511563768
Mr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.	10.486107133159013
—No, Simon, Father Cowley turned.	11.491251399977239
Play it in the original.	16.251449205728136
One flat.	10.643966947960198
The keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.	5.855344223705262
Up stage strode Father Cowley.	7.162052219930709
—Here, Simon, I’ll accompany you, he said.	7.839389409512867
Get up.	5.19641434079237
By Graham Lemon’s pineapple rock, by Elvery’s elephant jingly jogged.	15.018996698809332
Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding.	7.776787965173531
Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.	6.498157639503196
Most beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: _Sonnambula._ He heard Joe Maas sing that one night.	9.355853410246228
Ah, what M’Guckin! Yes.	13.501380679831579
In his way.	8.638583780803982
Choirboy style.	10.58374593461624
Maas was the boy.	11.320554645911766
Massboy.	32.172570290454246
A lyrical tenor if you like.	8.141255397604336
Never forget it.	4.387653053118659
Never.	25.535385961793953
Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.	8.091667310812038
Backache he.	5.6538518647795915
Bright’s bright eye.	11.061730497848519
Next item on the programme.	14.759141578838742
Paying the piper.	11.564129275045707
Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box.	7.940274442093711
Stave it off awhile.	11.198202135421623
Sings too: _Down among the dead men._ Appropriate.	12.23918250934206
Kidney pie.	11.308115195751736

Characteristic of him.	4.2908298779927625
Power.	18.814633242637697
Particular about his drink.	9.43654524831703
Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water.	8.413222546090166
Fecking matches from counters to save.	8.05456904767719
Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.	5.9961084576852475
And when he’s wanted not a farthing.	17.27497076909794
Screwed refusing to pay his fare.	9.216467814669507
Curious types.	15.009292486789496
Never would Richie forget that night.	5.553678468705849
As long as he lived: never.	13.605117619866009
In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake.	18.58138976456207
And when the first note.	17.996837319186568
Speech paused on Richie’s lips.	8.266028237010001
Coming out with a whopper now.	9.838877270219998
Rhapsodies about damn all.	5.326805672961224
Believes his own lies.	17.028260218315438
Does really.	8.440345427190756
Wonderful liar.	15.009292486789496
But want a good memory.	13.88810439741335
—Which air is that?	7.988764210509629
asked Leopold Bloom.	5.15395452668732
—_All is lost now_.	10.438550035217641
Richie cocked his lips apout.	13.276491178268259
A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all.	4.772943107385522
A thrush.	11.024559110298645
A throstle.	12.378863073457003
His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he’s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe.	8.265633125480681
Is lost.	8.724260627598019
Rich sound.	10.043109889305981
Two notes in one there.	6.113678561839444
Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley.	17.379890616163106
Taking my motives he twined and turned them.	5.082297468355395
Echo.	32.172570290454246
How sweet the answer.	5.890462770741301
How is that done?	24.675092246515426
All lost now.	5.366792148951843
Mournful he whistled.	11.769577816402348
Fall, surrender, lost.	5.957659425447725
Order.	32.172570290454246
Yes, I remember.	17.127788669460113
Lovely air.	6.350371338965926
In sleep she went to him.	6.294400546683623
Innocence in the moon.	13.547835984267719
Brave.	32.172570290454246
Don’t know their danger.	14.519113073207043
Still hold her back.	5.842277118990969
Call name.	6.446083459570686
Touch water.	6.868637755598182
Jingle jaunty.	13.012212935852498
Too late.	10.678835303822991
She longed to go.	6.361467782293301
That’s why.	15.653306828464878
Woman.	20.267449269082853
As easy stop the sea.	5.896760677496824
Yes: all is lost.	11.016418132271156
—A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold.	11.182053182696555
I know it well.	11.58318752355193
Never in all his life had Richie Goulding.	10.724277834447854
He knows it well too.	6.7540030983750965
Or he feels.	12.39113181177948
Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said.	6.222341777675938
Me?	17.705247751504768
Bloom askance over liverless saw.	6.616229597521148
Face of the all is lost.	9.86154866969686
Rollicking Richie once.	6.510026405027477
Jokes old stale now.	4.67377289375318
Wagging his ear.	7.141754613523309
Napkinring in his eye.	9.423160782686804
Now begging letters he sends his son with.	6.3805009292368355
Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir.	6.544792909953735
Wouldn’t trouble only I was expecting some money.	13.132854673380674
Apologise.	32.172570290454246
Piano again.	5.364875352896063
Sounds better than last time I heard.	12.375093012562651
Tuned probably.	7.674379201751439
Stopped again.	5.364875352896063
Dollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.	4.752286521031555
—With it, Simon.	13.361487426364672
—It, Simon.	7.5348620980456475
—Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.	10.0048071151367
—It, Simon.	7.5348620980456475
—I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.	11.830630763808886
By the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady’s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous _eau de Nil_ Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.	8.072202137273564
The harping chords of prelude closed.	7.019474758702912
A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.	5.531295565366265
—_When first I saw that form endearing_...	4.740739344061549
Richie turned.	9.005813332294762
—Si Dedalus’ voice, he said.	5.154240383118265
Braintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine.	6.311107696669878
Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar.	9.918575518564504
The door of the bar.	13.740006971448391
So. That will do.	8.657470770010399
Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.	9.55036658960929
—_Sorrow from me seemed to depart._ Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives.	8.822802175775552
Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard.	8.153729460560838
When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn’t expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.	10.479803326303822
Love that is singing: love’s old sweet song.	10.453365012669721
Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet.	12.391438902675416
Love’s old sweet _sonnez la_ gold.	8.84250143997698
Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.	7.537300095879524
—_Full of hope and all delighted_...	4.554998073588634
Tenors get women by the score.	16.03951779192084
Increase their flow.	9.014101665120823
Throw flower at his feet.	8.903820011381372
When will we meet?	13.381621725264287
My head it simply.	7.72777549861496
Jingle all delighted.	11.918392034010305
Your head it simply swurls.	9.841622157588752
Perfumed for him.	4.282004209160616
What perfume does your wife?	11.56258986998684
I want to know.	7.862351908272735
Jing.	32.172570290454246
Stop.	20.267449269082853
Knock.	32.172570290454246
Last look at mirror always before she answers the door.	7.350438157112694
The hall.	9.249999206678485
There?	22.307214335724716
How do you?	8.601888193989673
I do well.	11.533845774394727
There?	22.307214335724716
Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel.	9.399494315588932
Yes?	20.267449269082853
Hands felt for the opulent.	14.121260722339283
Alas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.	8.439527168516214
—_But alas, ’twas idle dreaming_...	3.348038964000999
Glorious tone he has still.	10.339054329725544
Cork air softer also their brogue.	8.142146555015735
Silly man! Could have made oceans of money.	8.058873539937027
Singing wrong words.	6.324283637755492
Wore out his wife: now sings.	11.45093117704662
But hard to tell.	10.422232492414986
Only the two themselves.	15.360720337657737
If he doesn’t break down.	10.789820328180342
Keep a trot for the avenue.	15.586316803324744
His hands and feet sing too.	7.342014389284136
Drink.	32.172570290454246
Nerves overstrung.	14.509135749322695
Must be abstemious to sing.	11.38814323615622
Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream.	6.7611566120584605
For creamy dreamy.	11.594886634034117
That’s the chat.	14.17919714125928
Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.	10.593249668035561
Words?	32.172570290454246
Music?	32.172570290454246
No: it’s what’s behind.	11.910054830703787
Bloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.	5.361314877970318
Bloom.	7.595351801251561
Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading.	7.109068012946418
Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her.	4.173712947861518
Tup.	22.307214335724723
Pores to dilate dilating.	9.519822747384417
Tup.	22.307214335724723
The joy the feel the warm the.	5.65901154772105
Tup.	22.307214335724723
Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob.	5.349208256332722
Now! Language of love.	7.00750609698865
—...	2.6475850980614206
_ray of hope is_...	3.2707304006201197
Beaming.	32.172570290454246
Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.	5.14332866516367
_Martha_ it is.	5.172173591328579
Coincidence.	22.307214335724723
Just going to write.	11.96751247816575
Lovely name you have.	7.039443174574366
Can’t write.	17.717905590695764
Accept my little pres.	11.652874134370387
Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too.	6.9767671831503995
She’s a.	8.289976770453926
I called you naughty boy.	6.33817968085421
Still the name: Martha.	15.319118685497058
How strange! Today.	7.757932425751102
The voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied.	9.161525732761124
It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait.	6.406184992321362
How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom’s heart.	8.624867671337732
Wish I could see his face, though.	11.727925296925239
Explain better.	7.7952769643417925
Why the barber in Drago’s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass.	11.747175491285338
Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.	12.899460929935373
—_Each graceful look_...	2.6042666205487213
First night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon’s in Terenure.	10.820122270459851
Yellow, black lace she wore.	10.835770803432078
Musical chairs.	12.63828403758352
We two the last.	7.335441751122115
Fate.	20.267449269082853
After her.	4.892668042093682
Fate.	20.267449269082853
Quick round.	9.327344790447794

Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling.	10.62244125372115
First I saw.	10.521253769366716
She thanked me.	4.230189224444075
Why did she me?	11.764429905806832
Fate.	20.267449269082853
Spanishy eyes.	5.455646160485135

Ah, alluring.	23.658097655216217
—_Martha! Ah, Martha!_ Quitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony.	8.550166960165518
In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel.	9.342693344209469

Sonnez la._ Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square.	9.437808589551661
Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.	7.505908835603103
An afterclang of Cowley’s chords closed, died on the air made richer.	11.168824669010132
And Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind.	7.842116322702935
Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second.	8.712444881915403
She did not mind.	12.108710250679954
—Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water.	9.110558601706966
Then you’d sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.	14.171699318972802

Tom Kernan strutted in.	7.114998369434716
Lydia, admired, admired.	10.44602870722647
But Bloom sang dumb.	11.36380114014264
Admiring.	32.172570290454246
Richie, admiring, descanted on that man’s glorious voice.	9.800473788694209
He remembered one night long ago.	8.724402674864015
Never forget that night.	6.420272633869491
Si sang _’Twas rank and fame_: in Ned Lambert’s ’twas.	7.571466937970798
Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did _then false one we had better part_ so clear so God he never heard _since love lives not_ a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.	8.127043802758434
Goulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert’s, Dedalus house, sang _’Twas rank and fame._ He, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing _’Twas rank and fame_ in his, Ned Lambert’s, house.	10.158355625943862
Brothers-in-law: relations.	8.474171238647614
We never speak as we pass by.	7.53273520896855
Rift in the lute I think.	12.027544601722747
Treats him with scorn.	14.548751001976866
See.	18.814633242637697
He admires him all the more.	7.621284616377457
The night Si sang.	11.515232755215028
The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.	7.917294411428256
That voice was a lamentation.	16.817924792642717
Calmer now.	4.779330306107821
It’s in the silence after you feel you hear.	10.637522710964593
Vibrations.	32.172570290454246
Now silent air.	5.9425913948875255
Bloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong.	7.150856330903887
He drew and plucked.	10.632375683794585
It buzz, it twanged.	12.748328193098851
While Goulding talked of Barraclough’s voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played.	10.01544153568863
While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.	12.313224629136318
Thou lost one.	5.928409114239937
All songs on that theme.	13.100013965030138
Yet more Bloom stretched his string.	7.973426201105459
Cruel it seems.	10.121727445757688
Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.	6.477045788587824

—Don’t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.	12.336832569319304
George Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.	13.541200461006477
First gentleman told Mina that was so.	7.368277227814183
She asked him was that so.	11.3162987802023
And second tankard told her so.	7.484338897848861
That that was so.	9.655936351124497
Miss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.	10.800332024651784

A pad to blot.	8.811288703026708
He heard, deaf Pat.	9.35649977174664
—Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line.	8.362212745206444

Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.	9.350478136670802

At Geneva barrack that young man died.	8.916299356010168
At Passage was his body laid.	12.989468088698453
Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.	12.440800653933866
By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.	10.401497108057216
Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard.	8.799197003166345
You who hear in peace.	6.9640007574610925
Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people.	7.440382267610403
He was the croppy boy.	11.462850503409593
Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy.	6.7368620745266545
General chorus off for a swill to wash it down.	7.844039245142917

Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.	8.949300107449965

Richie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward.	7.843642648931316
Uncertainly he waited.	8.808479876587086
Unpaid Pat too.	4.618152619174588

He murmured that he knew the name.	9.460512927632308
The name was familiar to him, that is to say.	9.40883836544002
That was to say he had heard the name of.	12.555690089768515
Dollard, was it?	10.787402992534297
Dollard, yes.	9.80497986931527
Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard.	16.873459331209304
He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina.	7.296441207511916
Mr Dollard.	9.383899257535278

at the corner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along and he near drove his gear into my eye.	10.958927399561786
—Lo, Joe, says I.	5.40989261174119
How are you blowing?	22.900007182611272
Did you see that bloody chimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?	14.320778316417059
—Soot’s luck, says Joe.	9.057754465880315
Who’s the old ballocks you were talking to?	15.634854385497539
—Old Troy, says I, was in the force.	11.779360462150455
I’m on two minds not to give that fellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and ladders.	10.831702357237152
—What are you doing round those parts?	16.1303634687371
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Devil a much, says I.	6.085445891952378
There’s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the garrison church at the corner of Chicken lane—old Troy was just giving me a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to pay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a hop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury street.	9.853507094692006
—Circumcised?	17.17289249749927
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Ay, says I.	5.683628322578651
A bit off the top.	15.012963856004532
An old plumber named Geraghty.	11.39397028109268
I’m hanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can’t get a penny out of him.	13.287090721890637
—That the lay you’re on now?	9.435766349675587
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Ay, says I.	5.683628322578651
How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful debts.	7.294455331855957
But that’s the most notorious bloody robber you’d meet in a day’s walk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.	12.308920395335697
_Tell him,_ says he, _I dare him,_ says he, _and I doubledare him to send you round here again or if he does,_ says he, _I’ll have him summonsed up before the court, so I will, for trading without a licence._ And he after stuffing himself till he’s fit to burst.	11.415550332542537
Jesus, I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out.	11.560983400843973
_He drink me my teas.	10.854444864436653
Because he no pay me my moneys?_ For nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin’s parade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter called the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E.	8.702533385132742
Geraghty, esquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward, gentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds avoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per pound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal, at threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the said vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value received which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in weekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no pence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or pledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall be and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the said vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the said amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said vendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between the said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one part and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the other part.	8.043128451593947
—Are you a strict t.t.?	9.515138249263497
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Not taking anything between drinks, says I.	6.01478742463039
—What about paying our respects to our friend?	13.954254191817617
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Who?	11.362660442813608
says I.	5.3154358834446676
Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.	11.796101343591372
—Drinking his own stuff?	16.783934313524185
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Ay, says I.	5.683628322578651
Whisky and water on the brain.	14.95015291389662
—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe.	7.497705371589468
I want to see the citizen.	9.834893392785379
—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I.	6.882753181808796
Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?	9.050166378188772
—Not a word, says Joe.	7.70217822797749
I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.	16.396155326688667
—What was that, Joe?	18.107834641270678
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease.	8.59134917872565
I want to give the citizen the hard word about it.	6.252297289939986
So we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the courthouse talking of one thing or another.	12.867459386944141
Decent fellow Joe when he has it but sure like that he never has it.	11.115071108191257
Jesus, I couldn’t get over that bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber.	16.699608362247336
For trading without a licence, says he.	6.154728484384192
In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan.	10.279341604576958
There rises a watchtower beheld of men afar.	7.6096487074864365
There sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown.	7.305896976381743
In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied.	11.396611082500948
Lovely maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects.	7.108591070605308
And heroes voyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.	9.273186298023676
And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended from chieftains.	7.534637092454166
Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.	5.069071624212229
I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.	7.693779357449924
Come out here, Geraghty, you notorious bloody hill and dale robber! And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling, cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting, champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.	6.218725436991279
So we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink.	12.29339325721782
—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his load of papers, working for the cause.	11.627729757954702
The bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps.	11.14584768165777
Be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog.	10.635248904221292
I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.	15.309218677980443
—Stand and deliver, says he.	5.389474753478003
—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe.	8.090838636550549
Friends here.	5.336865107850044
—Pass, friends, says he.	5.264805774255548
Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he: —What’s your opinion of the times?	15.46393705187898
Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill.	10.430552743810914
But, begob, Joe was equal to the occasion.	13.72907835910797
—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his fork.	12.882439676233703
So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says: —Foreign wars is the cause of it.	10.623073420677722
And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket: —It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.	12.298771494117597
I’ve a thirst on me I wouldn’t sell for half a crown.	11.726849640735049
—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.	9.170094270888212
—What’s yours?	23.19193967903524
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.	4.549288628945273
—Three pints, Terry, says Joe.	6.037795500938646
And how’s the old heart, citizen?	14.978892202979619
says he.	5.925124930617523
—Never better, _a chara_, says he.	5.516501647333763
What Garry?	15.110433593035388
Are we going to win?	17.95171327099592
And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, by Jesus, he near throttled him.	14.996154339199585
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.	7.198777496608457
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (_Ulex Europeus_).	7.485597724172179
The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest.	7.914418686750848
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower.	16.232427723691554
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble.	9.598693647897436
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes.	9.335664934337641
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughly stitched with gut.	6.169903904669055
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.	7.89071606113934
From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O’Donnell, Red Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O’Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy Higgins, Henry Joy M’Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff, Peg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain Boycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S.	5.39709974806392

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.	8.016755955499884
So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.	9.891565069364905
O, as true as I’m telling you.	11.743333095903374
A goodlooking sovereign.	10.194934978717557
—And there’s more where that came from, says he.	8.310525900627658
—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe?	8.188836271862794
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Sweat of my brow, says Joe.	7.681970116859132
’Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.	8.633797965920454
—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.	13.910540908585883
Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour?	10.030810755843165
O’Bloom, the son of Rory: it is he.	10.573920380168436
Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the prudent soul.	10.503924772402097
—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised organ.	11.237908698181027
The pledgebound party on the floor of the house.	8.609345273557047
And look at this blasted rag, says he.	7.568879131073754
Look at this, says he.	9.00381210185107
_The Irish Independent,_ if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend.	9.223846265755698
Listen to the births and deaths in the _Irish all for Ireland Independent,_ and I’ll thank you and the marriages.	15.067219137743752
And he starts reading them out: —Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son.	9.042511553205523
How’s that, eh?	9.616642308531329
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester.	7.277999479432767
Deaths.	32.172570290454246
—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.	16.645765919984633
—Cockburn.	14.509135749322695
Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen.	8.015922911953345
How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?	13.49110466996168
—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose.	12.09843203102282
Thanks be to God they had the start of us.	8.46128704785433
Drink that, citizen.	8.845110222911382
—I will, says he, honourable person.	12.462612464219198
—Health, Joe, says I.	5.035682081868287
And all down the form.	13.231853407049075
Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.	14.758945729932863
Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.	15.914127732152906
And lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came swiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him there passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred scrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage, fairest of her race.	8.620630586065422
Little Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s snug, squeezed up with the laughing.	10.124523457459343
And who was sitting up there in the corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob Doran.	13.48980855457132
I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the door.	10.24846685900254
And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen in his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and the wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a poodle.	12.3760728547763
I thought Alf would split.	12.774767582898582
—Look at him, says he.	7.596222959590927
Breen.	25.535385961793953
He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a postcard someone sent him with U.	15.78474609335657
p: up on it to take a li...	7.437805707337369
And he doubled up.	8.633862025534661
—Take a what?	8.719414074582712
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.	8.546616115509076
—O hell! says I.	9.869206695453157
The bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you seeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.	14.88618256991757
_—Bi i dho husht,_ says he.	6.684386092762287
—Who?	11.362660442813608
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Breen, says Alf.	7.73226590661354
He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round to Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to the subsheriff’s for a lark.	14.26800440184133
O God, I’ve a pain laughing.	9.79607979348851
U.	12.767692980896975
p: up.	4.887050564640962
The long fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.	11.145834931634452
—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy?	14.621113590994844
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
Is that Alf Bergan?	18.252049333945273
Hanging?	32.172570290454246
Wait till I show you.	6.707506145210314
Here, Terry, give us a pony.	15.98552702503776
That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds.	9.109100798390394
You should have seen long John’s eye.	10.511147200826231
U.	12.767692980896975
p ....	2.6455624702140987
And he started laughing.	11.737477851922668
—Who are you laughing at?	15.11413064795834
says Bob Doran.	8.60815627876171
Is that Bergan?	20.914946156802845
—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.	10.013057125236429
For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and mass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour juices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day from their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.	8.407632289886001
Then did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born, that nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that thirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.	11.545126061727629
But he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone in generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of costliest bronze.	8.61099598023159
Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen the image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick, Victoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even she, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for they knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.	10.629611291910441
—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and down outside?	11.127639904144193
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino.	11.292440024851173
Talking about hanging, I’ll show you something you never saw.	10.161423153630905
Hangmen’s letters.	16.577444473803613
So he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.	9.595923907401625
—Are you codding?	19.749776781121476
says I.	5.3154358834446676
Read them.	4.858053960907274
So Joe took up the letters.	10.266977460878339
—Who are you laughing at?	15.11413064795834
says Bob Doran.	8.60815627876171
So I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust.	19.505603538838656
Bob’s a queer chap when the porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk: —How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?	16.25417991600865
—I don’t know, says Alf.	11.51003885247481
I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy Dignam.	11.382352095127558
Only I was running after that...	5.499961671777988
—You what?	13.499107922910285
says Joe, throwing down the letters.	13.421848881102752
With who?	14.417072669753914
—With Dignam, says Alf.	9.783007864248226
—Is it Paddy?	18.410418612912007
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
Why?	12.512270304170855
—Don’t you know he’s dead?	11.825934786027968
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.	8.175348222155586
—Ay, says Joe.	5.871018539195904
—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a pikestaff.	13.35240395032494
—Who’s dead?	17.050157985903553
says Bob Doran.	8.60815627876171
—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.	12.510097385802073
—What?	12.016783147492532
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
What?...	2.588247333459426
And Willy Murray with him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s...	6.036431276351214
Dignam dead?	14.399535795191833
—What about Dignam?	24.66280834151533
says Bob Doran.	8.60815627876171
Who’s talking about...?	9.702700793052799
—Dead! says Alf.	6.645139599211379
He’s no more dead than you are.	12.457307427767187
—Maybe so, says Joe.	5.867699898899231
They took the liberty of burying him this morning anyhow.	8.67098859948422
—Paddy?	16.23056009194055
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
—Ay, says Joe.	5.871018539195904
He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.	5.458520055573127
—Good Christ! says Alf.	8.210667654684439
Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.	18.073559914403997
In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown of the head and face.	9.488241690391867
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.	9.475083065215086
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels.	11.486117941547993
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them.	11.882636248341027
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā, ālāvātār, hātākāldā, wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature.	8.090256289968512
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief.	6.382680207751094
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was: _We greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body.	13.81701530772583
Mind C.	5.446206677749058
K.	13.682684331782813
doesn’t pile it on._ It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H.	11.19889399896879
O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements.	18.69757798629099
Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good.	13.501284861429932
He stated that this had greatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requested that his desire should be made known.	9.254761643005315
Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction.	13.168999151180198
Fleet was his foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow.	13.969824653774486
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	13.163653574595667
—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.	8.485875537986379
—Who?	11.362660442813608
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Bloom, says he.	7.340805948803752
He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes.	12.944909011622697
And, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.	10.232719280100495
Little Alf was knocked bawways.	11.660443891320842
Faith, he was.	7.618085511736504
—Good Christ! says he.	7.84594304322987
I could have sworn it was him.	8.084134663763846
And says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest blackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence: —Who said Christ is good?	12.441886502588524
—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy Dignam?	16.462124079351636
—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off.	10.574200432082433
He’s over all his troubles.	17.675458925061278
But Bob Doran shouts out of him.	6.175937921231614
—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.	11.899448182035005
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises.	13.144832002882781
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.	7.800933056869784
—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.	14.013305579245833
Talking through his bloody hat.	8.714354228092732
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the bumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing her person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.	12.0661445361725
—The noblest, the truest, says he.	11.197153853754696
And he’s gone, poor little Willy, poor little Paddy Dignam.	11.428976855886651
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door.	9.184323695141323
—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.	10.817927193590975
So Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there.	11.339822728536774
—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters.	13.597771443844598
Listen to this, will you?	9.10748712239121
And he starts reading out one.	9.23576031427765
_7 Hunter Street, Liverpool._ _To the High Sheriff of Dublin, Dublin._ _Honoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i hanged..._ —Show us, Joe, says I.	7.479033273913489
—_...	2.4346256253589136
private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when..._ —Jesus, says I.	4.987282291276847
—_...	2.4346256253589136
Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith..._ The citizen made a grab at the letter.	8.30300030430736
—Hold hard, says Joe, _i have a special nack of putting the noose once in he can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms is five ginnees._ _H.	9.881236139817403
Rumbold, Master Barber._ —And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.	8.259342982613846
—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe.	10.90601282582448
Here, says he, take them to hell out of my sight, Alf.	15.069418625172359
Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?	16.9952128735163
So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he couldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’d just take a cigar.	10.987677947506548
Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.	12.64125237970273
—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.	7.835265966137895
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it.	10.139186307531121
—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.	10.978219463641098
And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.	10.011201932943656
In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor.	17.38901855310189
Their deadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.	6.539542625610213
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.	10.766003202437364
—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.	8.530696508363246
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.	13.685105850433665
—That so?	13.082647577254129
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—God’s truth, says Alf.	12.915612551498148
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible.	15.793654826696981
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.	21.22427304525633
—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.	7.6883003661619655
—That can be explained by science, says Bloom.	10.539560713597862
It’s only a natural phenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...	6.515388707925781
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon.	13.152437074882082
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to the best approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the _corpora cavernosa_ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis._ So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other.	9.744673062976602
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought.	14.386735867770744
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs.	7.337038069038605
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get.	12.42265618644389
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him: —Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here! Give us the paw! Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog: give you the bloody pip.	10.071963604489518
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring.	13.145814449850313
Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more.	13.337264461359952
Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.	8.338556279228841
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land.	9.044717062680117
And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face.	9.284145441711182
Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.	15.61210078673732
Time they were stopping up in the _City Arms_ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk.	13.306910983945647
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel.	12.328452422369521
Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat.	10.637282846218817
And Bloom with his _but don’t you see?_ and _but on the other hand_.	14.451928312335395
And sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment.	12.962869880883366
Phenomenon! —The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom.	9.66943688403313
—Ay, ay, says Joe.	6.325420230128764
—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom.	10.23076316403584
What I mean is...	4.3408130864098995
—_Sinn Fein!_ says the citizen.	6.782196739973305
_Sinn Fein amhain!_ The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.	8.6347876421108
The last farewell was affecting in the extreme.	13.053386286426258
From the belfries far and near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance.	8.960246086516065
The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle.	7.779544171930661
A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons.	11.50775950540687
A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse.	8.11681914595552
Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents.	9.642917903319338
Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang _The Night before Larry was stretched_ in their usual mirth-provoking fashion.	6.713932654671091
Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies.	8.378686889689105
The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat.	9.253236918635391
The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite.	8.81896986418693
The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed _doyen_ of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.	8.357296256416173
Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Señor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentge neralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein.	3.6439255170186646
All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness.	9.547545651185825
An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F.	7.395533166098636
T.	11.481841078558022
E.	10.594970405422256
I.	7.73347927951542
as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint.	13.08912183756031
In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged.	5.618875233011048
The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties.	6.356327506828873
The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted.	12.917231846411125
Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.	7.626171476706514
T.	11.481841078558022
E.	10.594970405422256
I., several of whom were bleeding profusely.	11.674317282061551
Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses.	11.427945588486624
The objects (which included several hundred ladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.	8.064598109842812
Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the _Gladiolus Cruentus_.	8.772311381470919
He announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so characteristic of the man.	6.261488138109876
The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, _hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah_, amid which the ringing _evviva_ of the delegate of the land of song (a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable.	7.407306116411148
It was exactly seventeen o’clock.	10.270891258713501
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi.	10.541204153049733
The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication.	10.117558992742037
Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously.	11.76472307987659
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office.	7.701060107951247
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim.	7.6472725070343675
Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.	9.304564061420457
The _nec_ and _non plus ultra_ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake.	10.042945988929747
The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _Sheila, my own_.	8.92633673107825
Encouraged by this use of her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach.	9.990792729390495
She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.	11.677744571862926
That monster audience simply rocked with delight.	5.827088517032185
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time.	8.541184520364848
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself.	7.916589043067504
Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage.	13.278590666430542
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped forward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day, and was accepted on the spot.	8.310705912197303
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing _fiancée_ an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds.	10.398115771382894
Nay, even the stern provostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his natural emotion.	9.132533741529059
With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _entourage,_ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone: —God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart.	9.40342181523506
Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.	10.613777720413724
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.	12.719686827340905
Antitreating is about the size of it.	6.817333022362518
Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth of his pint.	14.798071509593441
And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their musical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking.	9.458743435101995
Ireland sober is Ireland free.	6.865036232548826
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of.	11.201034615402916
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females, hitting below the belt.	9.256586552384434
So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me.	8.370025587690817
I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he was my dog.	14.153682586833211
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him.	8.667714926841592
—Afraid he’ll bite you?	10.711571169696642
says the citizen, jeering.	12.839564490036844
But he might take my leg for a lamppost.	22.905501487901127
So he calls the old dog over.	11.781387514971813
—What’s on you, Garry?	14.949675613972072
says he.	5.925124930617523
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.	13.153623991527848
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them.	8.561488833341963
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter _pro bono publico_ to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that.	10.81712939059658
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.	13.263256838417853
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _sobriquet_ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry.	9.284888303324035
The exhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse.	8.734054620659185
Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _striking_ resemblance (the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards.	7.407211818071616
C.	8.56499542248637
points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye.	11.634374770342903
We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.	8.559977107076799
The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught.	9.297562155682755
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour.	9.640726431913324
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you, Barney Kiernan, Has no sup of water To cool my courage, And my guts red roaring After Lowry’s lights.	7.741142990603913
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear him lapping it up a mile off.	12.467773085208966
And Joe asked him would he have another.	9.452804621374518
—I will, says he, _a chara_, to show there’s no ill feeling.	12.46436418381642
Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking.	16.435155979101854
Arsing around from one pub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators.	11.748572152836214
Entertainment for man and beast.	10.142336678642456
And says Joe: —Could you make a hole in another pint?	18.659729963606534
—Could a swim duck?	10.153549183440123
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Same again, Terry, says Joe.	7.1454375920669895
Are you sure you won’t have anything in the way of liquid refreshment?	16.354137366136822
says he.	5.925124930617523
—Thank you, no, says Bloom.	8.404895177483594
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.	8.863767863086009
Martin asked me to go to the house.	10.405319201966822
You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.	14.272535163454707
—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is landed.	9.001917863453354
So the wife comes out top dog, what?	11.500976069464462
—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.	15.631559323079186
—Whose admirers?	16.423130015348004
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.	13.229361903637463
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act.	12.482127121857289
He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court.	11.211024542473195
Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal Hungarian privileged lottery.	9.788492190042835
True as you’re there.	7.278200560379324
O, commend me to an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.	11.590316032618764
Choking with bloody foolery.	11.113478372849436
And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that.	8.166928139705032
Shake hands, brother.	9.823374048396643
You’re a rogue and I’m another.	10.535198305984691
—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour.	11.525744401117478
But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.	11.240246586309217
—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.	9.780216595879274
—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he.	10.389392861251261
The goodness of your heart, I feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.	9.367891446196559
And off with him and out trying to walk straight.	16.01445487263747
Boosed at five o’clock.	7.000320527048928
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A.	9.151179757950556
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups.	12.09418645338156
And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging.	12.24140277451784
And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another.	13.458787007294244
_How is your testament?	14.000496431684025
Have you got an old testament?_ Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what.	15.494306111989715
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady.	13.305071532079953
Jack Mooney’s sister.	14.975743580358719
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples.	14.475100445029952
Gob, Jack made him toe the line.	12.655093396211047
Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.	9.31088471785307
So Terry brought the three pints.	11.50121066718028
—Here, says Joe, doing the honours.	13.336613331874789
Here, citizen.	10.852058176930123
—_Slan leat_, says he.	4.744021527468919
—Fortune, Joe, says I.	5.369712018060371
Good health, citizen.	6.764684101210134
Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already.	13.995889116357516
Want a small fortune to keep him in drinks.	16.688681738029192
—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf?	13.933112044167634
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Friend of yours, says Alf.	7.560950080760177
—Nannan?	20.431750117251376
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
The mimber?	17.17289249749927
—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.	11.846341941801919
—I thought so, says Joe.	10.928525365972828
I saw him up at that meeting now with William Field, M.	9.806214149514496
P., the cattle traders.	17.741708223375312
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.	12.051760186068632
Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard.	19.079966607421994
Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier.	12.239783831200567
Mister Knowall.	14.509135749322695
Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks.	11.845264014526684
Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her.	9.97411871176971
Couldn’t loosen her farting strings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do it.	7.869799111921051
What’s your programme today?	15.636422036048662
Ay. Humane methods.	11.288016440253498
Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently.	11.244579345184624
Gob, he’d have a soft hand under a hen.	16.16830290083567
Ga Ga Gara.	8.453238317346695
Klook Klook Klook.	8.90266209737369
Black Liz is our hen.	10.174272377211835
She lays eggs for us.	5.587331790719884
When she lays her egg she is so glad.	11.57038227370287
Gara.	20.267449269082853
Klook Klook Klook.	8.90266209737369
Then comes good uncle Leo.	7.656482614706218
He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her fresh egg.	9.849708665481256
Ga ga ga ga Gara.	7.464605351426773
Klook Klook Klook.	8.90266209737369
—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.	9.381120408897386
—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going?	14.646212803392341
I wanted to see him, as it happens.	16.275924547180665
—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.	12.203748508746031
—That’s too bad, says Bloom.	8.131906321895807
I wanted particularly.	19.930978955050122
Perhaps only Mr Field is going.	7.237844818122216
I couldn’t phone.	16.71910707901553
No. You’re sure?	23.718227773378533
—Nannan’s going too, says Joe.	9.841882561399627
The league told him to ask a question tomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.	9.836668064211503
What do you think of that, citizen?	14.801542560182622
_The Sluagh na h-Eireann_.	7.881220362169377
Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham.	8.402496923913278
Nat.): Arising out of the question of my honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathological condition?	9.75286852700138
Mr Allfours (Tamoshant.	10.573402910433618
Con.): Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house.	11.193502273506903
I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that.	6.693248727604991
The answer to the honourable member’s question is in the affirmative.	20.1183928964515
Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte.	11.287461539786287
Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?	11.1856282099723
Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.	16.826275822620094
Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench?	10.307079833167341
(O! O!) Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.	14.510312718567253
Mr Staylewit (Buncombe.	9.053322957505186
Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.	13.063520642149202
(Ironical opposition cheers.) The speaker: Order! Order! (The house rises.	7.547990596326409
Cheers.) —There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival.	10.91326158696294
There he is sitting there.	10.575873609034879
The champion of all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot.	8.114522805638565
What was your best throw, citizen?	12.511743364960498
—_Na bacleis_, says the citizen, letting on to be modest.	9.96523581509724
There was a time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.	14.830512051261618
—Put it there, citizen, says Joe.	7.7300216523583645
You were and a bloody sight better.	12.729362075318376
—Is that really a fact?	12.818056978524464
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
—Yes, says Bloom.	7.865959450242127
That’s well known.	16.033158887306932
Did you not know that?	14.748971254172009
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all to that.	7.355667401041026
And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad.	11.54934552299276
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: _Look at, Bloom.	12.581500885041143
Do you see that straw?	20.266545470072113
That’s a straw_.	17.750602991802545
Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.	17.098620346149932
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of _Brian O’Ciarnain’s_ in _Sraid na Bretaine Bheag_, under the auspices of _Sluagh na h-Eireann_, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race.	8.735334154718485
The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions.	13.578838459770951
After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers.	11.271024284249672
The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages.	8.971571627875168
L.	11.002864267888413
Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need recalling here) _A nation once again_ in the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself.	8.311586761575306
The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it.	8.67833285631525
His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned professions.	10.620301310516334

—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that Keogh-Bennett match?	10.13648702567386
—No, says Joe.	7.336813202516701
—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.	11.888555385523544
—Who?	11.362660442813608
Blazes?	32.172570290454246
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
And says Bloom: —What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the eye.	9.247934887277642
—Ay, Blazes, says Alf.	8.277269183415633
He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time.	11.095507683630117
—We know him, says the citizen.	8.398693181372211
The traitor’s son.	9.774659850328051
We know what put English gold in his pocket.	10.77207225646145
—True for you, says Joe.	6.371934586297607
And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood, asking Alf: —Now, don’t you think, Bergan?	10.899281204296111
—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf.	7.487399349109327
Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it.	7.030807820891745
Handed him the father and mother of a beating.	15.764307410974764
God, he gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what he never ate.	14.570000938129388
It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns.	8.089901348443224
Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.	10.169676062265673
The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions.	8.90227873542365
The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy.	10.909955474523068
The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett’s jaw.	11.877688161314945
The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook, the body punch being a fine one.	9.553134503266092
The men came to handigrips.	14.3596055014324
Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him.	8.260787266685305
The Englishman, whose right eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime.	8.111805509925997
It was a fight to a finish and the best man for it.	12.088309757137088
The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high.	5.750408140181197
The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.	6.428762633020177
After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat.	9.285575279666405
It was a knockout clean and clever.	13.715203224687349
Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.	8.746202860765418
—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf.	7.47866992572931

—He is, says Joe.	7.96744574153019
Isn’t he?	10.18147957745841
—Who?	11.362660442813608
says Bloom.	5.242049790701048
That’s quite true.	16.165095878187163
Yes, a kind of summer tour, you see.	12.774342552460283
Just a holiday.	19.174617579047016
—Mrs B.	7.515219193560763
is the bright particular star, isn’t she?	12.11139523217218
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—My wife?	20.570729359446577
says Bloom.	5.242049790701048
I think it will be a success too.	11.100925455924601
He’s an excellent man to organise.	13.726901988022105

—Was it you did it, Alf?	17.656958359303324
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.	12.711425957947675
—Me?	13.189619284591796
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.	11.13533988859291
—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence against you.	8.904069051314544
—Of course an action would lie, says J.	7.98221262209311
It implies that he is not _compos mentis_.	13.214386453170613
U.	12.767692980896975
p: up.	4.887050564640962
_—Compos_ your eye! says Alf, laughing.	10.43672138403183
Do you know that he’s balmy?	23.347502774261272
Look at his head.	11.304199999045307
Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on with a shoehorn.	16.570767525548362
—Yes, says J.	8.270378177002224
—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.	6.043706682276284
—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.	12.749796169820854
—Pity about her, says the citizen.	6.156783460171035
Or any other woman marries a half and half.	8.504619040229686
—How half and half?	17.559343860880084
says Bloom.	5.242049790701048
—Half and half I mean, says the citizen.	5.841648393805179
A fellow that’s neither fish nor flesh.	10.875700314835353
—Nor good red herring, says Joe.	4.9625347252326355
—That what’s I mean, says the citizen.	7.1710918395254435
A pishogue, if you know what that is.	8.187783650458053
Begob I saw there was trouble coming.	12.155908572888734
And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool.	15.339005858045324
Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain.	12.47338141533425
And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the pope.	13.398277645321448
Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street.	11.835741103244585
And who was he, tell us?	16.685011504885676
A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a week, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to the world.	9.806832472620126
—And moreover, says J.	9.439366517417179
J., a postcard is publication.	16.06083559996718
It was held to be sufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v.	14.945598996185556
Hole.	32.172570290454246
In my opinion an action might lie.	9.25259599953822
Six and eightpence, please.	6.575532360017651
Who wants your opinion?	15.16289527376256
Let us drink our pints in peace.	8.502086515899594
Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.	14.303239034533243
—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.	12.321496267212884
—Good health, Ned, says J.	9.024228721611086
—-There he is again, says Joe.	7.624441021773008
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.	14.339659950744178
—How did that Canada swindle case go off?	11.939611180149004
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Remanded, says J.	5.822803633821407
One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob.	10.015405459097193
Do you see any green in the white of my eye?	18.304004316501747
Course it was a bloody barney.	19.429802915999225
was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.	15.077135651341248
—Who tried the case?	18.74515327780196
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Recorder, says Ned.	8.099676629745126
—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.	10.65597724040228
—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned.	9.545069476632586
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	12.09814137765741
—Ay, says Alf.	7.656145973606355
Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for the corporation there near Butt bridge.	11.56456892083093
And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry: —A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?	15.211419788218357
Ten, did you say?	13.19607722725351
—Yes, your worship.	14.14077062034097
And my wife has the typhoid.	14.878983870088021
—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court immediately, sir.	6.52664553891394
No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment.	13.218785397765041
How dare you, sir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industrious man! I dismiss the case.	12.518075478057524
And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law.	13.422831391078626
There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _in re_ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another.	8.45165612198545
And to the solemn court of Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer.	10.804643789386066
And he sat him there about the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of Dublin.	13.719528727270204
And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true.	10.66153540766439
And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict give according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book.	10.278804345311823
And they rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His rightwiseness.	12.841862451253913
And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received.	7.886612466867515
And they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.	10.232298061532763
—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs.	9.318165422764796
So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford.	13.906755908149185
And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.	9.514798960250026
—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have repetition.	14.180118788775353
That’s the whole secret.	15.981264082177612
—Rely on me, says Joe.	6.736298340383271
—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland.	6.233068907234299
We want no more strangers in our house.	9.361965382037098
It’s just that Keyes, you see.	8.804395883161755
—Consider that done, says Joe.	5.661736118190441
—Very kind of you, says Bloom.	9.032073630905115
—The strangers, says the citizen.	8.166494374972544
Our own fault.	9.89922041220762
We let them come in.	6.949323179231117
We brought them in.	5.657384340499807
The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here.	6.902561765365242
—Decree _nisi,_ says J.	5.921045771321775
And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.	14.805440936943366
—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all our misfortunes.	12.063325413271484
—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the _Police Gazette_ with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.	13.824284631626417
—Give us a squint at her, says I.	7.626075198056364
And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher.	11.220836414949998
Secrets for enlarging your private parts.	7.885288040426082
Misconduct of society belle.	11.256238646637106
Norman W.	6.284774998831351
Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor.	5.141348062418813
Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W.	8.727742154469247
Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.	12.175242318474833
—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is! —There’s hair, Joe, says I.	9.286192375626518
So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast.	10.561609425099292
—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?	11.351757874082757
What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language?	13.38926238931394
O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.	10.90499382965298
To hell with the bloody brutal Sassenachs and their _patois._ So J.	9.565386144253736
puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation.	9.34258231769765
—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen.	6.455791334167216
To hell with them! The curse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name.	10.824572796105391
Any civilisation they have they stole from us.	6.799502036127938
Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.	8.620113499183631
—The European family, says J.	10.084695502148094
J....	2.6793111913265184
—They’re not European, says the citizen.	6.695679273063276
I was in Europe with Kevin Egan of Paris.	9.102001767389627
You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europe except in a _cabinet d’aisance._ And says John Wyse: —Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.	10.748160173117718
And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo: —_Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!_ He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan _Lamh Dearg Abu_, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.	9.956610196023066
You look like a fellow that had lost a bob and found a tanner.	13.773151428509362
—Gold cup, says he.	6.16388078921716
—Who won, Mr Lenehan?	20.74144506440109
_—Throwaway,_ says he, at twenty to one.	10.098401950226723
A rank outsider.	12.09985100592354
And the rest nowhere.	28.179024591938834
—And Bass’s mare?	28.468225795093083
—Still running, says he.	6.439639493123708
Boylan plunged two quid on my tip _Sceptre_ for himself and a lady friend.	10.953961900603009
—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on _Zinfandel_ that Mr Flynn gave me.	11.900429225758671
Lord Howard de Walden’s.	4.330618884066144
—Twenty to one, says Lenehan.	9.621229798174074
Such is life in an outhouse.	14.861675900805386
Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.	15.479590299010765
Frailty, thy name is _Sceptre._ So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangy snout up.	13.657218506554273
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.	12.239254035326017
—Keep your pecker up, says Joe.	6.120388884962839
And J.	4.907412681013932
and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking in an odd word.	12.004990987778221
—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’t see the beam in their own.	10.361043226500916
—_Raimeis_, says the citizen.	4.617586376170439
There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that won’t see, if you know what that means.	12.974259715199079
Where are our missing twenty millions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?	12.558856587826455
And our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world.	9.208539217385056
Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen?	10.572409525844154
Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.	7.490770920126059
Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip of Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters.	7.724922945355678
What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruined hearths?	8.587087931727075
And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?	11.763816454826596
—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.	8.996382872713589
Larches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast.	10.87088074697504
—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage.	9.523977101018241
Save the trees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.	10.552726940974692
—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.	9.344294340783751
The fashionable international world attended _en masse_ this afternoon at the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.	7.895354607653475
Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash, Mrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde Twelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia Creeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs Maud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss Bee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel Cedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall, Mrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana Forrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis graced the ceremony by their presence.	6.793832857801288
The bride who was given away by her father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze.	8.925987564735225
The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty _motif_ of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.	9.16526758658585
Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played a new and striking arrangement of _Woodman, spare that tree_ at the conclusion of the service.	10.881777912091195
On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre _in Horto_ after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots.	5.112507371878675
Mr and Mrs Wyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.	10.843659488437222
—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen.	8.636894677516272
We had our trade with Spain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.	10.437441815043687
—And will again, says Joe.	8.514775973637223
—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the citizen, clapping his thigh.	12.61037855439278
Our harbours that are empty will be full again, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifth himself.	10.088466844149039
And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.	11.652105584239596
And he took the last swig out of the pint.	19.360831695710022
Moya.	32.172570290454246
All wind and piss like a tanyard cat.	10.18063401203282
Cows in Connacht have long horns.	6.54821389177959
As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.	11.87979757317705
—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse.	7.788373606678408
What will you have?	19.719190849692925
—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.	9.470570188237634
—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up.	8.673415274659428
Terry! Are you asleep?	16.370284518691605
—Yes, sir, says Terry.	14.688772002713687
Small whisky and bottle of Allsop.	8.162583367525908
Right, sir.	6.542435444389132
Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public.	12.750560832961435
Picture of a butting match, trying to crack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like a bull at a gate.	14.184683549634283
And another one: _Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga_.	6.188915296334391
A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under him.	10.026394651931884
Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.	14.697142610871232
—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?	13.44536845783043
—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen.	9.81006392892835
Hell upon earth it is.	5.2657960465473135
Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on the training ships at Portsmouth.	12.342577997100301
A fellow writes that calls himself _Disgusted One_.	7.583965665577372
So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.	11.804740776429481
—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech.	12.44500259628207
And says John Wyse: —’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.	12.006450640978047
Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yells meila murder.	14.100887047557261
—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the earth.	8.535367473127486
The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs and cottonball barons.	13.485401160391262
That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges and whipped serfs.	8.519148490900157
—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.	9.095613767192354
—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it.	8.755369774291518
The unfortunate yahoos believe it.	3.8681937271829407
They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.	8.47616813431875
I mean wouldn’t it be the same here if you put force against force?	16.087010787674643
Didn’t I tell you?	9.376706374243875
As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.	10.873322285423775
—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen.	7.266265791289203
We have our greater Ireland beyond the sea.	8.23935258034926
They were driven out of house and home in the black 47.	11.992330722833445
Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by the batteringram and the _Times_ rubbed its hands and told the whitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America.	8.137210763947326
Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres.	9.498497573628326
But the Sassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro.	9.388433430350874
Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes.	17.217243000852317
Twenty thousand of them died in the coffinships.	19.158915243210878
But those that came to the land of the free remember the land of bondage.	14.631367199116454
And they will come again and with a vengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.	13.432321432611687
—Perfectly true, says Bloom.	6.3471114715947925
But my point was...	3.490128697875229
Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.	14.105397158042793
—Ay, says John Wyse.	9.060265176477294
We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us against the Williamites and they betrayed us.	8.88427461291976
Remember Limerick and the broken treatystone.	14.98295495947814
We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.	8.745838833297103
Fontenoy, eh?	7.673417198419805
And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa.	8.23900757042603
But what did we ever get for it?	10.177534788495885
—The French! says the citizen.	8.141972700642022
Set of dancing masters! Do you know what it is?	10.499922230998886
They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland.	8.348107677323302
Aren’t they trying to make an _Entente cordiale_ now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidious Albion?	11.789349572099061
Firebrands of Europe and they always were.	10.500775302605993
—_Conspuez les Français_, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.	8.608869784270645
—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?	13.189704824352258
Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _Ehren on the Rhine_ and come where the boose is cheaper.	11.42287383168366
—Well, says J.	7.9018106396258405
We have Edward the peacemaker now.	6.456469641010642
—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen.	7.656347341196942
There’s a bloody sight more pox than pax about that boyo.	10.646767821830105
Edward Guelph-Wettin! —And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.	10.417401882918274
The earl of Dublin, no less.	12.922486838051542
—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little Alf.	12.602912092091598
And says J.	7.153864067816663
J.: —Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.	10.818162830726356
—Will you try another, citizen?	14.221559329512345
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Yes, sir, says he.	7.304294647626988
—You?	24.422391396819812
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
—Beholden to you, Joe, says I.	6.787685760777926
May your shadow never grow less.	7.565930834833781
—Repeat that dose, says Joe.	4.692728884691557
Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.	9.851658404610466
—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.	8.525830859682193
Perpetuating national hatred among nations.	8.842102523371231
—But do you know what a nation means?	21.097260624942734
says John Wyse.	7.903156667425854
—Yes, says Bloom.	7.865959450242127
—What is it?	8.031263818381309
says John Wyse.	7.903156667425854
—A nation?	32.13459290699695
says Bloom.	5.242049790701048
A nation is the same people living in the same place.	13.403304647707952
—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m living in the same place for the past five years.	13.6045477995438
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out of it: —Or also living in different places.	13.216407144924808
—That covers my case, says Joe.	8.557757270116362
—What is your nation if I may ask?	17.454559263440117
—Ireland, says Bloom.	7.8270702032708375
I was born here.	12.918115212945697
Ireland.	13.682684331782813
The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and, gob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.	10.930440444660812
—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to swab himself dry.	10.29513184034562
—Here you are, citizen, says Joe.	7.034888526880347
Take that in your right hand and repeat after me the following words.	11.290973112514267
The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth attributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolonged admiration.	6.434721614677739
No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill.	10.703637250671289
The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides.	7.994906462129469
Patrick’s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college refectory, Curley’s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of Wellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street Warehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us today rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have passed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.	10.607466883043768
—Show us over the drink, says I.	8.616656339439803
Which is which?	14.093234408100013
—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.	15.73621384217261
Also now.	4.779330306107821
This very moment.	7.999159759143073
This very instant.	10.336586229192989
Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.	16.566651171038952
—Robbed, says he.	4.9348039687820355
Plundered.	32.172570290454246
Insulted.	32.172570290454246
Persecuted.	32.172570290454246
Taking what belongs to us by right.	6.540589017570099
At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.	9.090352273601345
—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem?	21.82164149913126
—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.	9.55593002884239
—Right, says John Wyse.	9.409917285112835
Stand up to it then with force like men.	9.770573984279983
That’s an almanac picture for you.	6.798631016388817
Mark for a softnosed bullet.	16.580722764639606
Old lardyface standing up to the business end of a gun.	13.535192848343765
Gob, he’d adorn a sweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him.	10.54484708555768
And then he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as limp as a wet rag.	14.317869114514973
—But it’s no use, says he.	8.883990244810917
Force, hatred, history, all that.	5.076498082890719
That’s not life for men and women, insult and hatred.	10.36076285252678
And everybody knows that it’s the very opposite of that that is really life.	10.572203195943244
—What?	12.016783147492532
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
—Love, says Bloom.	7.419875300658261
I mean the opposite of hatred.	9.68995733820728
I must go now, says he to John Wyse.	11.441917290985165
Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there.	10.808265981559884
If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second.	14.013605661044064
Just a moment.	8.612295484836384
Who’s hindering you?	14.334200184092207
And off he pops like greased lightning.	7.444208477536578
—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen.	9.090617932239404
Universal love.	7.552503918852979
—Well, says John Wyse.	10.290797413459176
Isn’t that what we’re told.	14.505422303642634
Love your neighbour.	10.385745597744803
—That chap?	33.22179339505234
Beggar my neighbour is his motto.	11.366014325645514
Love, moya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.	12.950906856362893
Love loves to love love.	7.224298948876225
Nurse loves the new chemist.	13.88210543558623
Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle.	11.950594394801668
loves a fair gentleman.	11.816418660695664
Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow.	5.604480580677621
Jumbo, the elephant, loves Alice, the elephant.	14.351868659876741
Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear trumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye.	8.960699706501872
The man in the brown macintosh loves a lady who is dead.	12.903308342707598
His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen.	9.435888250959545
Mrs Norman W.	5.569497406875205
Tupper loves officer Taylor.	7.707549668873446
You love a certain person.	11.653748922047612
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	8.143561194567834
—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song.	10.194290341710385
More power, citizen.	6.541060492645177
—Hurrah, there, says Joe.	6.218084809390397
—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.	7.870742268741379
And he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.	12.539136958486477
—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket.	7.749858451768733
What about sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and children of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text _God is love_ pasted round the mouth of his cannon?	11.716426941478373
The bible! Did you read that skit in the _United Irishman_ today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?	11.993271270614313
—What’s that?	8.007760855344218
says Joe.	5.2831441776690555
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out: —A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions.	9.108977748908519
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor.	10.863170327821848
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _Black and White_ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girl hands.	8.123477178998657
—Widow woman, says Ned.	10.176320785675864
I wouldn’t doubt her.	8.442947776189035
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would.	15.03418729115764
—Same only more so, says Lenehan.	8.598099587326386
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.	7.281306127405601
—Is that by Griffith?	17.515977233773008
says John Wyse.	7.903156667425854
—No, says the citizen.	6.453894049287442
It’s only initialled: P.	8.785797330092265
—And a very good initial too, says Joe.	9.73070978747844
—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen.	9.871872372673081
Trade follows the flag.	8.273016338900494
—Well, says J.	7.9018106396258405
J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad.	12.553299407927513
Did you read that report by a man what’s this his name is?	13.958008208813352
—Casement, says the citizen.	4.617586376170439
He’s an Irishman.	17.023212196098655
—Yes, that’s the man, says J.	8.02752666182498
Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.	9.115645793908179
—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.	14.375402422446404
—Who?	11.362660442813608
says I.	5.3154358834446676
—Bloom, says he.	7.340805948803752
The courthouse is a blind.	11.84679227724119
He had a few bob on _Throwaway_ and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.	16.527445175561546
—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir?	14.31488691104304
says the citizen, that never backed a horse in anger in his life?	11.565950903591775
—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan.	13.280017474672215
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.	14.442806616842477
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on.	10.29946320990148
He’s the only man in Dublin has it.	9.30369286188309
A dark horse.	10.097068258617336
—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.	9.559265058710409
—Mind, Joe, says I.	5.265487843041601
Show us the entrance out.	7.108611647733108
—There you are, says Terry.	14.475426260450035
Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort.	13.964370348935553
So I just went round the back of the yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my _(Throwaway_ twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube _she’s better_ or _she’s_ (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.	10.532048535158799
So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.	9.103554291408713
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.	10.945465237162832
Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.	11.40385942323935
Give us a bloody chance.	15.721441612266457
God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout.	17.71385173530041
Mr Bloom with his argol bargol.	18.260660167887178
And his old fellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country with his baubles and his penny diamonds.	12.512602207626921
Loans by post on easy terms.	8.435791354661852
Any amount of money advanced on note of hand.	7.175632123972506
Distance no object.	10.78301536817259
No security.	15.009292486789496
Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with every one.	12.343109306044473
—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse.	10.046624270580477
And there’s the man now that’ll tell you all about it, Martin Cunningham.	14.251732436083184
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense.	11.769790515166559
—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.	10.339835748240223
Saucy knave! To us! So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.	10.96460788610432
Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.	13.850314987632768
—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.	11.788198964628862
—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked.	9.099757811970246
Look to our steeds.	14.686649114573655
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.	5.894387581317439
—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare larder.	9.799402082917576
I know not what to offer your lordships.	13.330798056635484
—How now, fellow?	18.13775846951059
cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant countenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?	10.758707128155905
An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.	10.952426521680149
—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly.	10.177251555699296
An you be the king’s messengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught.	11.51793825531832
The king’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me.	9.164294490498843
—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman by his aspect.	13.104137650982498
Hast aught to give us?	13.062065287547663
Mine host bowed again as he made answer: —What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of venison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head with pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish?	11.677427622714136
—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker.	12.366197064784815
That likes me well.	7.534242625765072
Pistachios! —Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance.	14.663573079891645
A poor house and a bare larder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.	9.825987286830928
So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.	6.250349650035718
—Where is he?	9.971790703840202
says Lenehan.	8.239705318738974
Defrauding widows and orphans.	9.199622715911824
—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein?	13.533916005084535
—That’s so, says Martin.	11.334922767776346
Or so they allege.	13.862368981310656
—Who made those allegations?	15.053206537222959
says Alf.	6.556971014434095
—I, says Joe.	7.668308129882497
I’m the alligator.	12.573556089758522
—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like the next fellow?	13.481903250021588
—Why not?	12.039830487436788
says J.	4.907412681013932
J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.	9.656976639083128
—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he?	13.010337577054162
says Ned.	8.132721127856204
No offence, Crofton.	9.00615808202469
—Who is Junius?	21.005936115945335
says J.	4.907412681013932
—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.	12.852332147633309
—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system.	13.77786107646202
We know that in the castle.	17.442288032611785
—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist?	9.079537013426645
says Jack Power.	9.600961506919313
—Not at all, says Martin.	11.119428159584373
Only namesakes.	14.509135749322695
His name was Virag, the father’s name that poisoned himself.	10.756006711573662
He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.	11.453562286154037
—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen.	8.136546146456125
Island of saints and sages! —Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin.	10.85390583732762
—Yes, says J.	8.270378177002224
J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their Messiah.	13.756485400615848
—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.	8.782729284633914
—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born.	10.772956070054342
I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.	11.260873848099868
—_En ventre sa mère_, says J.	4.977084112915628
—Do you call that a man?	17.23255036772018
—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.	15.001841429265877
—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.	12.69743277107693
—And who does he suspect?	18.50728237231701
Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest.	11.169900432684024
One of those mixed middlings he is.	7.85326525520388
Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache like a totty with her courses.	12.971899360887866
Do you know what I’m telling you?	11.180252089561392
It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea.	13.83627488269328
Justifiable homicide, so it would.	8.163566019643614
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man.	10.128824459665635
Give us your blessing.	17.33871783466996
Not as much as would blind your eye.	7.00879606758663
—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin.	12.724242655906634
But where is he?	9.020529418652364
We can’t wait.	11.784341290498448
—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen.	9.688330088846252
That’s what he is.	9.827248775200506
Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him.	4.452891448197065
Cursed by God.	7.434932167843234
—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin?	14.932903860263023
says Ned.	8.132721127856204
—Only one, says Martin.	12.102127622729348
We must be quick.	14.520587609085851
and S.	4.672979226442925
—You, Jack?	18.439295178882002
Crofton?	32.172570290454246
Three half ones, Terry.	8.354769962359198
—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us, says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.	8.824594668613079
—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass.	11.512216438478958
God bless all here is my prayer.	11.566082131969473
—Amen, says the citizen.	4.866208318632004
—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.	8.652683768020774
And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers, minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.	6.3633634996446515

And all came with nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords and olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of their efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes, trees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys, dragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives, soupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches, forceps, stags’ horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a dish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns.	4.49290945490803
And as they wended their way by Nelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain street chanting the introit in _Epiphania Domini_ which beginneth _Surge, illuminare_ and thereafter most sweetly the gradual _Omnes_ which saith _de Saba venient_ they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising the dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind, discovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and fulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying.	6.788660899799511
And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick.	7.952639111702578
And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein.	9.085957372950034
—_Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini._ —_Qui fecit cœlum et terram._ —_Dominus vobiscum._ —_Et cum spiritu tuo._ And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed and they all with him prayed: —_Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde super creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum._ —And so say all of us, says Jack.	6.693933125053773
—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.	9.786925564381656
—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.	13.678379614750735
And butter for fish.	8.842454255621664
I was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when be damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.	12.066434245896403
—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you.	12.328549814414952
I hope I’m not...	4.490188460627408
—No, says Martin, we’re ready.	14.981387677451396
Courthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.	10.040960723725407
Mean bloody scut.	10.054806593673995
Stand us a drink itself.	13.98151651245383
Devil a sweet fear! There’s a jew for you! All for number one.	10.231293543201968
Cute as a shithouse rat.	14.213912754828597
Hundred to five.	8.461456363305341
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen.	6.616049230658539
—Beg your pardon, says he.	5.709657450476836
—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue.	17.039553638609597
Come along now.	6.6846950020674285
—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him.	6.078719657020664
It’s a secret.	15.528333989240673
And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.	17.430495539306126
—Bye bye all, says Martin.	9.333742389405419
And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.	15.01706484194524
—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.	14.004532421811838
A many comely nymphs drew nigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.	9.656756701288737
Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.	13.244544802912518
And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the waves.	11.93619323501053
But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.	10.406611584179062
—Let me alone, says he.	9.151292571659798
And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out of him: —Three cheers for Israel! Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake and don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.	11.431148775365823
Jesus, there’s always some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about bloody nothing.	11.486128333508951
Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it would.	12.59638826162214
And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew.	16.805995228049408
Your God.	8.20316471001972
—He had no father, says Martin.	17.142099078592604
That’ll do now.	11.854272671630943
Drive ahead.	10.5155878536592
—Whose God?	13.360733515000225
—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he.	9.7777792245132
Your God was a jew.	11.778229000861975
Christ was a jew like me.	8.11910559412786
Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.	16.85020684194665
—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy name.	9.44291132054411
By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will.	10.67290725552771
Give us that biscuitbox here.	6.541578336419435
—Stop! Stop! says Joe.	8.486341226364367
A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from the metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters).	6.870110671929669
The ceremony which went off with great _éclat_ was characterised by the most affecting cordiality.	11.005280312547013
An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob _agus_ Jacob.	11.673903970549663
The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _Come Back to Erin_, followed immediately by _Rakóczsy’s March_.	9.316490414757931
Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the coastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three Rock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom.	8.706936779183808
Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the flags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.	9.744228194723865
_Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!_ Gone but not forgotten.	8.81466556066638
Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre: —Where is he till I murder him?	15.191832409719735
And Ned and J.	4.455407162964249
paralysed with the laughing.	12.22152960795983
—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.	10.880833079574831
But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way and off with him.	10.320167328622771

Stop! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly.	11.856047907241024
Mercy of God the sun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead.	12.47975478022638
Gob, he near sent it into the county Longford.	17.4437603107615
The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect.	7.102769500360347
The observatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of the rebellion of Silken Thomas.	10.686247802447673
The epicentre appears to have been that part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.	8.607264635973944
All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive.	11.813642638893672
From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.	7.230198218248813
An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle with the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway, the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale.	10.475812004608638
Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west.	7.803086240370901
Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _missa pro defunctis_ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst.	10.027187856305648

Gob, if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting.	12.697755073519224
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses.	8.434769201859899
O, Jesus, he did.	15.702501676011883
—Did I kill him, says he, or what?	11.615152230315418
And he shouting to the bloody dog: —After him, Garry! After him, boy! And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.	14.61871575666501
Hundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise you.	10.439641710073271
When, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven.	10.760320612239989
And they beheld Him in the chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him.	12.185340904697988
And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: _Elijah! Elijah!_ And He answered with a main cry: _Abba! Adonai!_ And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe’s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.	10.189992573145732
[ 13 ] The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace.	8.294910947237588
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.	9.778258527330925
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly.	12.386338567359198
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name _H.	9.569881369975992
Belleisle_ printed on both.	9.587956800368682
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.	6.017104002466568
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long.	10.000221594198756
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight.	7.983552193785911
He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words.	11.650426190947039
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.	13.757303582955979
—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said.	5.550605879635464
Say out big, big.	8.700809942061527
I want a drink of water.	8.863979774938795
And baby prattled after her: —A jink a jink a jawbo.	10.136005075188546
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on.	9.593628438862552
What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib.	12.440237564033549
None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey.	9.374898332895302
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme.	12.890343392925208
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.	10.527831768787708
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky.	12.351596677347873
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had.	10.267930147839875
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too.	9.072735274469272
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.	9.526524173331675
—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively.	14.564905557125085
At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand.	12.402536182161395
Wait till I catch you for that.	7.8056106228865225
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister’s word was law with the twins.	10.590065120610609
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure.	17.4084918294693
His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.	9.964466085376955
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.	10.927011139904362
—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.	6.28731124189273
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly: —What’s your name?	11.413593100082892
Butter and cream?	16.715922627404833
—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman.	11.96731180625412
Is Cissy your sweetheart?	10.85562908520653
—Nao, tearful Tommy said.	3.641855203894418
—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart?	16.076662354200252
Cissy queried.	11.336631323079757
—Nao, Tommy said.	3.7553633535449564
—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes.	9.814480794469699
I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart.	22.985313398718365
Gerty is Tommy’s sweetheart.	14.671159881970153
—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.	11.087862439209642
Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.	12.447126406241912
But who was Gerty?	24.138096252933327
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see.	9.770302912675875
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell.	11.945673176979403
Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling.	8.692376629057428
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either.	9.195168490657759
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again.	11.774954174094376
No. Honour where honour is due.	10.81983913338928
There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly _hauteur_ about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.	10.596757642583444
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.	9.262938182583548
Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist.	11.301682478769557
Why have women such eyes of witchery?	9.800126647862319
Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows.	10.16368000919025
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.	10.557378768973283
It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it.	9.54207997659903
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose?	11.916846811593123
That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one.	9.86075289232734
But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair.	9.697049836308716
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it.	11.137813710592601
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth.	10.475674439122146
And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.	12.014476572140387
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes.	8.81003164222382
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.	10.98642306752697
Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.	13.511847176026127
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning.	10.86667388277912
As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window.	12.742937028959913
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W.	13.417156890620147
E.	10.594970405422256
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university.	13.04640281857812
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core.	10.660551942435232
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time.	10.276841360820091
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph.	13.121907802893968
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.	13.684389930622165
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out.	10.602342792420432
A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the _Lady’s Pictorial_ that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection.	9.666054850767571
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone.	6.966549155079606
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny.	10.149976084704857
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.	14.57040622613006
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _petite_ but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep.	8.996158116450195
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops.	7.3368256966407515
As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her?	9.789814216706585
She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday.	12.529064515544391
And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time.	9.28687486033524
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror.	13.362284746923208
You are lovely, Gerty, it said.	7.0381765860073715
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful.	8.56309179600713
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.	9.391816730945518
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.	12.960659607263057
C.	8.56499542248637
D.	10.724190096818079
(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be.	8.349379817134736
He was too young to understand.	15.873933895363056
He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright.	21.13624826287813
The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips.	12.436233059359616
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments.	14.245957906118477
Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men.	10.073229441519272
But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over.	11.282308143488734
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss.	9.854062575384615
It would be like heaven.	12.5193110989143
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve.	9.048834592556213
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.	10.568890595036779
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be.	11.462461707094397
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November.	12.768752483371044
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess.	8.916303928391905
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses.	8.721319851402496
He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.	10.742441788234407
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight.	14.26316101371874
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please.	13.62577065494086
The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies.	14.304463270325751
Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.	11.65293337228283
—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said.	6.902169210646947
It’s my ball.	13.916603031266105
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.	11.972968554279031
—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.	14.405304099929012
And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin.	8.127837259635067
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.	8.22681722975195
—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.	12.039697861197167
—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.	10.034540762487685
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said.	9.888828395902646
But not a pin cared Ciss.	13.163499350981152
—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose.	14.19286416625378
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.	13.506490701096865
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls.	12.490299032906078
You had to laugh at her sometimes.	14.900039284029962
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White.	12.636478127260418
That was just like Cissycums.	23.85945490958729
O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette.	13.38062508907516
There was none to come up to her for fun.	17.995925012525404
But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.	12.78327839933467
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ.	15.506280045702336
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins.	9.414449864247278
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking.	12.880498071497149
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days.	6.925363538804216
Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.	13.056635600067745
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful.	8.241331982859812
And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk.	9.456939637651075
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.	13.169735959902704
Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang _Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee_ or _My love and cottage near Rochelle_ and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and when he sang _The moon hath raised_ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke.	9.641938813887316
Her mother’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.	11.396502060534589
No-one would have thought the end was so near.	14.83166416165929
Now he was laid to rest.	12.75872241889197
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.	11.556279590100155
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold.	10.790942441253621
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff.	9.542858337278718
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways.	13.392013511148825
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window.	10.828080026606381
You could see there was a story behind it.	10.76646646945558
The colours were done something lovely.	6.618425997337825
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat.	16.08567181306113
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.	12.970244009337296
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks.	9.751878824267802
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball.	9.158246388516709
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please.	8.930910824021774
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock.	12.11964519793975
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.	11.453959627096566
—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.	7.723009864381521
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip.	6.669013868887079
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.	10.748960147520938
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	10.962416423842745
She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks.	9.09704923192413
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose.	7.334525177864631
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.	10.093420868888659
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers.	7.712026499807184
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air.	7.990158918291697
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.	13.95061069826083
—Say papa, baby.	8.676091893627099
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.	6.4249054788169015
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.	10.66138920810875
—Haja ja ja haja.	7.7521174936706325
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him.	9.541867210494722
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it: —Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.	9.129288449768685
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks.	7.879595146160316
It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.	10.617159467204562
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.	11.20277680741859
She gazed out towards the distant sea.	10.34934473437798
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft.	14.527372305315993
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat.	9.486253229501896
Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look.	15.19090313128831
Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them?	8.950707096545777
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly _retroussé_ from where he was sitting.	12.636026014216352
He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face.	13.252778108884293
She would have given worlds to know what it was.	12.018013446946773
He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down.	13.793027183413896
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away.	12.755301313953108
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed.	16.523231710855843
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else.	15.870361483409162
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him.	11.231899479590368
If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not.	13.119377717590863
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her.	8.681432972200868
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm.	8.658308061701641
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past.	11.682222452059026
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.	10.975298703276671
Refuge of sinners.	11.564058977322793
Comfortress of the afflicted.	28.754244147016045
_Ora pro nobis_.	11.559459238549989
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart.	9.402248107418195
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down.	13.201952492573541
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic.	12.802894551955012
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word.	12.966990691934855
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.	11.626284538975641
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it.	8.899097495107215
Little monkeys common as ditchwater.	9.469088423403917
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them.	13.12752064251771
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.	13.154758202583828
—Jacky! Tommy! Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she’d ever bring them out.	10.226209675421586
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it.	13.636238972230492
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible.	13.568358872700866
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble.	11.202039363357072
_Tableau!_ That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.	15.896254799155594
Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _Tantum ergo_ and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the _Tantumer gosa cramen tum_.	11.878660211673312
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.	10.379156163960245
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature.	13.578012096718641
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that.	8.895152278702511
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve.	10.164867654684148
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes.	10.175030073153483
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey.	12.40735668137776
Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.	11.256350291504717
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.	10.63211428756771
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers.	12.018950672454599
And she said to Gerty: —A penny for your thoughts.	16.27964896806531
—What?	12.016783147492532
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth.	11.332875440959864
I was only wondering was it late.	17.502755505113026
Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late.	11.537720868889021
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again.	11.569283299870255
But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.	16.456561339277442
—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the time by his conundrum.	11.90143358488684
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church.	13.97448571097594
One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.	12.69313334806632
Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set.	12.601784987417924
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.	14.723589641009603
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.	11.48773804550613
Then they sang the second verse of the _Tantum ergo_ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time.	12.618216560710488
It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets.	15.692120001567904
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon.	13.746210346840357
His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine.	10.57071473772274
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face.	13.361083309807142
It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.	10.507537294052238
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _Panem de coelo praestitisti eis_ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over.	10.702361066563812
Gerty winced sharply.	9.370198846866712
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable.	8.928668891685307
It hurt—O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.	9.706067499976058
Gerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of.	9.551127121229674
She had loved him better than he knew.	12.032183992386559
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears.	12.202205469305548
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.	9.97585512067087
—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up.	9.037077106687622
I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.	11.898359491090083
Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily.	10.59913262315123
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with.	14.42137366130599
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces.	12.970884746811713
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot.	11.986530306930504
Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.	11.117096323793175
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior.	11.842876097294035
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.	11.066771171053851
—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss.	8.176817314942094
He has his bib destroyed.	13.182346676567809
The slight _contretemps_ claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.	7.449668354715863
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.	11.72304889126179
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.	11.086029321254612
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _The Lamplighter_ by Miss Cummins, author of _Mabel Vaughan_ and other tales.	9.393849903780728
For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of.	7.995815157801614
She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.	10.856918103947898
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs.	11.676833455440741
_Art thou real, my ideal?_ it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about _twilight, wilt thou ever?_ and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it.	8.805255280335256
But it must end, she felt.	18.92163809648273
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her.	9.627003239218872
Love laughs at locksmiths.	9.699457531614852
She would make the great sacrifice.	17.368163712287124
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts.	7.9248011570785115
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness.	11.962921678284728
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind.	13.712387795199836
But even if—what then?	10.679565109184399
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled.	9.756830594743397
She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station.	10.907695083408493
No, no: not that.	9.183426183103752
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess.	13.376737326980992
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall.	15.668744395951146
She thought she understood.	12.389146655506869
She would try to understand him because men were so different.	12.54857096906992
The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes.	8.120069807005272
Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide.	15.031896793200978
Nothing else mattered.	11.733687710003622
Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.	8.541413119287864
Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _Laudate Dominum omnes gentes_ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out: —O, look, Cissy! And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.	10.845306237306563
—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.	7.600839624759142
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.	13.063626714736332
—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called.	11.515094845474396
It’s the bazaar fireworks.	13.506552008268647
But Gerty was adamant.	12.618569175086648
She had no intention of being at their beck and call.	10.857252987296446
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was.	11.053061970547063
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling.	10.282969026285771
She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.	9.716276732374354
Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had made her his.	11.944138723098613
At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips.	11.983084783796908
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her.	8.455989053813019
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed.	12.143455212598852
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips.	13.580919099800631
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.	12.149921725795346
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark.	11.075783584954257
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking.	11.818627286827347
She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages.	13.091286552474491
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft! Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent.	9.004482826777458
Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl.	12.395724951304361
He was leaning back against the rock behind.	14.810072940706215
Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes.	9.142143551866909
What a brute he had been! At it again?	14.676259311498946
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered?	11.339749582651788
An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered.	12.134221586793053
Should a girl tell?	16.683721642157376
No, a thousand times no.	14.676475782470192
That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.	10.098184495435422
Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried: —Gerty! Gerty! We’re going.	12.540280874361455
Come on.	5.866048127058964
We can see from farther up.	9.203659744441108
Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses.	15.584464637919009
She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back.	9.59144564261941
Wonder if he’s too far to.	9.55064500714638
She rose.	8.284095472877421
Was it goodbye?	20.31522547160894
She drew herself up to her full height.	14.382365747153367
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face.	9.599546867090531
She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.	11.947374152808322
Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman.	11.021743751280058
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed.	12.906767737571744
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell was...	7.729401169630501
Tight boots?	18.946674774680638
No. She’s lame! O! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away.	14.861397707698353
Poor girl! That’s why she’s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint.	14.405059189819136
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib.	15.509992576046496
Jilted beauty.	10.690278245847093
A defect is ten times worse in a woman.	7.789377442671854
But makes them polite.	11.175909801302003
Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show.	12.811897410978872
Hot little devil all the same.	7.4855723323544385
I wouldn’t mind.	10.495085219327475
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses.	14.543171454834118
That squinty one is delicate.	11.593637140595577
Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish.	10.321997146877589
I have such a bad headache today.	11.680038786133354
Where did I put the letter?	17.134598804632795
Yes, all right.	13.090818256913536
All kinds of crazy longings.	10.850900613336483
Licking pennies.	12.621260247635798
Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil.	8.916591955182659
Virgins go mad in the end I suppose.	10.638465461407895
Sister?	20.267449269082853
How many women in Dublin have it today?	15.404415297764807
Martha, she.	9.915313043789755
Something in the air.	9.728543868975674
That’s the moon.	10.63328554058418
But then why don’t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean?	13.8696085164169
Depends on the time they were born I suppose.	14.19135418609756
Or all start scratch then get out of step.	9.317980345273895
Sometimes Molly and Milly together.	7.2808611177448554
Damned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter.	11.557776679478955
Made up for that tramdriver this morning.	9.574667648391673
That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing.	9.836360038130797
And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe.	18.37427700062717
Thankful for small mercies.	9.911096386925795
Cheap too.	4.66219583534958
Yours for the asking.	18.072820522955823
Because they want it themselves.	10.96144934694473
Their natural craving.	11.531865023799293
Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.	14.685339943243568
Reserve better.	7.7952769643417925
Don’t want it they throw it at you.	9.60698743421562
Catch em alive, O.	5.8782023353442465
Pity they can’t see themselves.	11.912010301902908
A dream of wellfilled hose.	8.586190825363296
Where was that?	9.15276789930409
Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only.	8.221589448524274
Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?	11.320930780424879
_Lingerie_ does it.	4.031301324766863
Felt for the curves inside her _déshabillé._ Excites them also when they’re.	9.91582734481085
I’m all clean come and dirty me.	7.461645716212153
And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice.	15.96856106982433
Milly delighted with Molly’s new blouse.	12.106770245870669
At first.	6.50596300780374
Put them all on to take them all off.	13.71118898760229
Molly.	14.933184300879459
Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers.	9.717510108787803
He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met.	9.348432370074988
His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what?	5.760063936773656
of jet.	15.101486301579408
Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out.	7.359669198751796
Pinned together.	7.759401275561229
O, Mairy lost the pin of her.	6.935320291828671
Dressed up to the nines for somebody.	13.76977126865941
Fashion part of their charm.	18.025480067450736
Just changes when you’re on the track of the secret.	14.411577711687633
Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.	7.128821832243063
No reasonable offer refused.	8.593645253857396
She wasn’t in a hurry either.	10.654269616380914
Always off to a fellow when they are.	12.501685425159762
They never forget an appointment.	12.266860822985539
Out on spec probably.	7.222140668927885
They believe in chance because like themselves.	7.313126073949187
And the others inclined to give her an odd dig.	17.871682293524763
Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden.	9.297446007864188
Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can’t get.	9.365452920036859
Barbed wire.	10.5155878536592
Be sure now and write to me.	6.930768812184586
And I’ll write to you.	8.52296228572354
Now won’t you?	7.429013871275794
Molly and Josie Powell.	13.288781981717614
Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.	10.238117590691413
_Tableau!_ O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all?	16.354411322858216
What have you been doing with yourself?	10.308856024398827
Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you.	7.220689566243126
Picking holes in each other’s appearance.	13.063260213569215
You’re looking splendid.	12.655334454868507
Sister souls.	9.590083934049536
Showing their teeth at one another.	7.111818170596982
How many have you left?	20.160257454745263
Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch of salt.	12.310587571616077
Ah! Devils they are when that’s coming on them.	10.521402709871476
Dark devilish appearance.	8.177183943216315
Scratch the sole of my foot.	9.947781413199728
O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too.	9.147605971011878
Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then.	11.647204313850668
Safe in one way.	9.657392460814524
Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap.	10.023969871689392
Something about withering plants I read in a garden.	9.075847867882024
Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt.	12.615098445633794
All are.	7.5529402740119815
Daresay she felt I.	6.0323292494952145
When you feel like that you often meet what you feel.	13.465344951902079
Liked me or what?	10.137001167503445
Dress they look at.	12.317597925929705
Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs.	7.294469190657088
Well cocks and lions do the same and stags.	8.583064061716472
Same time might prefer a tie undone or something.	5.634683327303231
Trousers?	32.172570290454246
Suppose I when I was?	12.505402091919036
No. Gently does it.	6.846241568636503
Dislike rough and tumble.	8.393350254057136
Kiss in the dark and never tell.	12.963649291253581
Saw something in me.	6.017212703313889
Wonder what.	13.9373213476541
Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic.	9.171040602797143
Ought to attend to my appearance my age.	9.669519214603502
Didn’t let her see me in profile.	16.70512818802334
Still, you never know.	12.572774868188462
Pretty girls and ugly men marrying.	8.439282600062846
Beauty and the beast.	15.925357154982246
Besides I can’t be so if Molly.	10.36870770750158
Took off her hat to show her hair.	10.198859025833617
Wide brim.	14.833002552262101
Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell.	8.445028271003748
Hair strong in rut.	9.417547937586932
Why not?	9.967831938818229
Suppose he gave her money.	11.541926927759208
Why not?	9.967831938818229
She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound.	14.040780850936246
I think so.	10.90294780773282
All that for nothing.	12.859374975167063
Bold hand: Mrs Marion.	7.431426015838668
Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn?	15.003078657067636
And the day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie.	18.2701475109261
Wrangle with Molly it was put me off.	9.302432549984369
Richie Goulding: he’s another.	11.532342980437589
Weighs on his mind.	11.477338836562927
Funny my watch stopped at half past four.	7.6842850092360795
Dust.	32.172570290454246
Shark liver oil they use to clean.	6.828714571147621
Could do it myself.	10.209640048700296
Save.	25.535385961793953
Was that just when he, she?	11.577540615920533
O, he did.	13.80762318594308
Into her.	4.892668042093682
She did.	8.3397291011653
Done.	22.307214335724723
Ah! Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt.	9.145692428203976
O Lord, that little limping devil.	13.428739143917127
Begins to feel cold and clammy.	10.405294412371811
Aftereffect not pleasant.	11.966655626903885
Still you have to get rid of it someway.	19.55080113184917
They don’t care.	11.586008718610355
Complimented perhaps.	6.814204367651865
Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies.	10.605245885614421
See her as she is spoil all.	9.631420249214436
Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music.	9.317015877818262
The name too.	6.664958035149753
_Amours_ of actresses.	11.769887253287905
Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe.	8.519423027371321
Curtain up.	4.963090012978215
Moonlight silver effulgence.	9.273251986821604
Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.	7.936393121000982
Little sweetheart come and kiss me.	5.846871305508794
Still, I feel.	14.892003801310945
The strength it gives a man.	5.731418383516232
That’s the secret of it.	7.086584206374797
Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s.	10.45156691769109
Cider that was.	5.901119183842478
Otherwise I couldn’t have.	7.421300812610392
Makes you want to sing after.	12.8608552998336
_Lacaus esant taratara_.	10.53625214251107
Suppose I spoke to her.	6.255392559451338
What about?	17.37127333651805
Bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the conversation.	11.327314878809297
Ask them a question they ask you another.	10.364641938009019
Good idea if you’re stuck.	13.093388282059692
Gain time.	5.108055618187879
But then you’re in a cart.	14.575090530348454
Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening.	14.06279857723752
O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was.	10.231806744905441
Whew! Girl in Meath street that night.	6.642071048861834
All the dirty things I made her say.	12.547038599088427
All wrong of course.	6.277288042277958
My arks she called it.	4.143883020094202
It’s so hard to find one who.	14.467724855157718
Aho! If you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden.	14.820677278548116
And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings.	10.625792886407035
Parrots.	32.172570290454246
Press the button and the bird will squeak.	13.014008034792143
Wish she hadn’t called me sir.	7.909409662889013
O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s what they enjoy.	17.449527972742338
Taking a man from another woman.	8.942834321297447
Or even hear of it.	4.113572210092239
Glad to get away from other chap’s wife.	14.824262366531249
Eating off his cold plate.	14.801271055287781
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle.	10.890414353181463
French letter still in my pocketbook.	15.952917116471022
Cause of half the trouble.	9.034785781419313
But might happen sometime, I don’t think.	7.981153945377199
Come in, all is prepared.	16.0181083626062
I dreamt.	15.69326635837007
Worst is beginning.	11.969932099721325
How they change the venue when it’s not what they like.	10.387338485570048
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who.	13.304268506473266
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.	11.469312971725035
Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.	9.916345494651004
Because I did.	8.425926209436113
She too.	4.66219583534958
Then make it up.	6.165290611450547
Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake.	9.622010798062623
Flatters them.	4.858053960907274
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time.	10.159102837744856
What harm?	21.487193240218037
Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he.	8.631446767001586
First kiss does the trick.	6.949133090235294
The propitious moment.	6.106348954755538
Something inside them goes pop.	8.960727426336463
Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly.	13.19713336991094
First thoughts are best.	7.296780374580912
Remember that till their dying day.	6.182543039115663
Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens.	9.38259939927024
Fifteen she told me.	4.941867907227557
But her breasts were developed.	8.880032631906078
Fell asleep then.	6.020122136873306
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home.	10.55344444512623
Featherbed mountain.	11.45105843651282
Gnashing her teeth in sleep.	7.240320580016199
Lord mayor had his eye on her too.	10.267915192506527
Val Dillon.	16.325528146736787
Apoplectic.	32.172570290454246
There she is with them down there for the fireworks.	19.011080466835725
My fireworks.	11.336631323079757
Up like a rocket, down like a stick.	13.999652819269555
And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen.	12.871726960602949
Want to be grownups.	28.451960194385705
Dressing in mother’s clothes.	12.572183771982171
Time enough, understand all the ways of the world.	10.131124808853382
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth.	15.379983969002174
I knew she could whistle.	18.386596600573764
Mouth made for that.	5.426290517428126
Like Molly.	8.482924775699805
Why that highclass whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.	10.363451593661045
Would you mind, please, telling me the right time?	13.105204663043407
I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.	14.30875249893759
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.	5.628458929123687
Caressing the little boy too.	7.903790365528483
Onlookers see most of the game.	11.39809689882158
Of course they understand birds, animals, babies.	9.488166309196423
In their line.	9.262682497143972
Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand.	18.27159074009271
Wouldn’t give that satisfaction.	14.28202167718383
Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls.	7.866024991460677
Fine eyes she had, clear.	9.872448338897476
It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil.	13.260110953845304
Did she know what I?	11.88920668187418
Course.	32.172570290454246
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump.	16.923009537284187
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show.	9.975924964496778
Call that innocence?	13.910753245828232
Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her.	8.17051806597925
Never see them sit on a bench marked _Wet Paint_.	13.337245095557568
Eyes all over them.	7.381654056138682
Look under the bed for what’s not there.	11.179705836775709
Longing to get the fright of their lives.	10.370048999999751
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm.	10.34187113591489
Had, too.	4.89600559955522
Where do they get that?	11.631541444330326
Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.	12.31947369293255
Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean.	9.8849668112785
Bred in the bone.	18.80315431581853
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing.	11.059208672897526
Best place for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror.	13.162398702419068
And when I sent her for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx.	11.337680553155646
I never told her.	8.2277086640049
Neat way she carries parcels too.	5.53412838885695
Attract men, small thing like that.	6.711065939304085
Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red.	13.684224863377128
Who did you learn that from?	15.510605202854428
Nobody.	22.307214335724723
Something the nurse taught me.	5.233681351748229
O, don’t they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west.	12.995370859200717
Me have a nice pace.	17.038025716787413
Who knows?	14.706166233704028
Ways of the world.	8.67512538476046
Young student.	9.175398092422556
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other.	10.262313565292157
Still she was game.	14.196334078667832
Lord, I am wet.	21.42482283600865
Devil you are.	6.8819594790409315
Swell of her calf.	20.03883844738388
Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point.	7.121330634061582
Not like that frump today.	11.153730916203779
A.	9.56954361575378
E.	10.594970405422256
Rumpled stockings.	9.989309400773019
Or the one in Grafton street.	9.062433424888743
White.	25.535385961793953
Wow! Beef to the heel.	12.750677995873053
A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles.	5.9445572378212
Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads.	6.463661571879896
And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.	12.563472145987106
Will she?	11.416369082545659
Watch! Watch! See! Looked round.	8.431939554261312
She smelt an onion.	8.765142480001957
Darling, I saw, your.	14.257989059499874
I saw all.	8.486565850970651
Lord! Did me good all the same.	8.261556158952342
Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s.	5.946544494166267
For this relief much thanks.	6.87391474683641
In _Hamlet,_ that is.	5.3816284269713215
Lord! It was all things combined.	19.76480897307996
Excitement.	32.172570290454246
When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue.	12.359127381158801
Your head it simply swirls.	11.997071789622009
He’s right.	9.694378904435188
Might have made a worse fool of myself however.	9.59136939544131
Instead of talking about nothing.	9.999827536785011
Then I will tell you all.	9.134172260833031
Still it was a kind of language between us.	12.074081500312925
It couldn’t be?	12.374112679096765
No, Gerty they called her.	11.089385989255227
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.	12.24952915511292
Place made me think of that I suppose.	12.333085704985734
All tarred with the same brush.	19.178964819122587
Wiping pens in their stockings.	11.92644815677712
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.	18.186309832153867
Every bullet has its billet.	9.526973902183492
Course I never could throw anything straight at school.	8.210702837680067
Crooked as a ram’s horn.	21.145797116527966
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah.	12.65896088891701
No soft job.	7.576827274751319
Saves them.	4.858053960907274
Keeps them out of harm’s way.	12.119493555883919
Nature.	32.172570290454246
Washing child, washing corpse.	9.881250151775722
Dignam.	14.05266445304813
Children’s hands always round them.	7.715230246287642
Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.	9.237486105979627
Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck.	10.949167228438025
Fill it up with wind.	12.355510400023125
Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy.	8.322389900281426
Must call to the hospital.	15.905615281362254
Wonder is nurse Callan there still.	7.6471806283311015
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.	13.144096240671063
That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.	9.699795956419162
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable.	12.838709535184929
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms.	12.584575943557441
Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat.	8.425737248837361
Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose.	13.018268132546854
Chickens come home to roost.	13.18744195188387
They stick by one another like glue.	11.939662060544133
Maybe the women’s fault also.	13.75135042821297
That’s where Molly can knock spots off them.	7.374709547094001
It’s the blood of the south.	14.326283756285477
Moorish.	25.535385961793953
Also the form, the figure.	15.602219747156346
Hands felt for the opulent.	14.121260722339283
Just compare for instance those others.	7.806999252900513
Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard.	14.124516902323998
Allow me to introduce my.	14.403843679235667
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her.	9.198542191505707
Always see a fellow’s weak point in his wife.	13.516202494527361
Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love.	12.142671142011217
Have their own secrets between them.	6.6330868006436985
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t take them in hand.	12.148136908705096
Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies.	11.691900941571474
As God made them he matched them.	6.364576056056552
Sometimes children turn out well enough.	7.71039320559236
Twice nought makes one.	5.386898991723538
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride.	6.808258950222173
Marry in May and repent in December.	7.316699381205184
This wet is very unpleasant.	9.623325488385214
Stuck.	32.172570290454246
Well the foreskin is not back.	6.553716427260782
Better detach.	14.833002552262101
Ow! Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket.	15.123709719971613
Long and the short of it.	7.854064945649163
Big he and little she.	9.425085884267322
Very strange about my watch.	8.383653052587352
Wristwatches are always going wrong.	10.546961585061407
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he.	12.418490954523024
Yes, I suppose, at once.	12.25179251020302
Cat’s away, the mice will play.	13.641895464666336
I remember looking in Pill lane.	9.823988908047477
Also that now is magnetism.	11.465824240941837
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.	10.437734859574782
That causes movement.	9.376200588746011
And time, well that’s the time the movement takes.	10.345493213971357
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.	8.213501705552375
Because it’s all arranged.	14.967322705213345
Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the stars.	11.611524493696031
Little piece of steel iron.	12.060786800744413
When you hold out the fork.	14.473822041933587
Woman and man that is.	7.078605215059239
Fork and steel.	8.594546097825493
Molly, he.	7.023933322077861
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you’re a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you.	9.78021290004216
Have to let fly.	16.08261090698953
Wonder how is she feeling in that region.	16.08264521762579
Shame all put on before third person.	8.541694840030498
More put out about a hole in her stocking.	14.208418805491986
Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show.	13.872762212824084
And when the painters were in Lombard street west.	9.290609491476204
Fine voice that fellow had.	10.648045965656827
How Giuglini began.	7.599081278357534
Smell that I did.	11.539784177845046
Like flowers.	9.61019340202837
It was too.	8.415623052392702
Violets.	32.172570290454246
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint.	20.77566906740773
Make their own use of everything.	14.381677077609384
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn’t hear.	9.282552574665997
But lots of them can’t kick the beam, I think.	10.135002833815504
Keep that thing up for hours.	11.23338123774113
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.	11.99869031471238
Hm. Hm. Yes.	8.3344830633233
That’s her perfume.	9.175025207967321
Why she waved her hand.	5.417042523263752
I leave you this to think of me when I’m far away on the pillow.	12.372416427852158
What is it?	7.424324335348126
Heliotrope?	32.172570290454246
No. Hyacinth?	28.649265256584183
Hm. Roses, I think.	8.924375424393617
She’d like scent of that kind.	18.89618689599023
Sweet and cheap: soon sour.	8.908735005731428
Why Molly likes opoponax.	10.066070029457634
Her high notes and her low notes.	10.280174529620577
At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours.	14.62548793678328
Heat brought it out.	6.512775618099072
Good conductor, is it?	6.370779886430142
Or bad?	18.96180666893817
Light too.	4.66219583534958
Suppose there’s some connection.	10.943897675255194
For instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark.	13.878548300509237
Mysterious thing too.	4.6270643942191425
Why did I smell it only now?	11.392362326727927
Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure.	6.481044518395367
Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.	10.222489685895601
Yes, it is.	7.9013956148843025
Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off.	5.570753048034151
Tell you what it is.	6.648780074231392
It’s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it.	9.85414749263782
Clings to everything she takes off.	6.245924866578449
Vamp of her stockings.	16.282170359045036
Warm shoe.	15.088141794024638
Stays.	32.172570290454246
Drawers: little kick, taking them off.	5.832874911082493
Byby till next time.	4.973354467262801
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed.	11.770712994560812
Know her smell in a thousand.	12.320326104297813
Bathwater too.	4.66219583534958
Reminds me of strawberries and cream.	8.13616861894478
Wonder where it is really.	16.06568491423228
There or the armpits or under the neck.	11.037003030708364
Because you get it out of all holes and corners.	12.380377241168775
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.	5.405053261986524
Muskrat.	32.172570290454246
Bag under their tails.	11.54546433040225
One grain pour off odour for years.	5.905845883618344
Dogs at each other behind.	9.600878524047259
Good evening.	10.70397704667392
Evening.	32.172570290454246
How do you sniff?	22.099752682142324
Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you.	7.068563399240317
Animals go by that.	5.530640092910962
Yes now, look at it that way.	10.173142363713431
We’re the same.	8.479284704490325
Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period.	10.059185270164013
Come near.	10.72341701616123
Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on.	7.2740233253373106
Like what?	9.05465731588898
Potted herrings gone stale or.	7.262471702886078
Boof! Please keep off the grass.	10.258621158118954
Perhaps they get a man smell off us.	11.027552625765285
What though?	18.977525637248363
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day.	10.028635145310938
Breath?	32.172570290454246
What you eat and drink gives that.	5.8150603505148855
No. Mansmell, I mean.	12.389105512095963
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different.	12.938256168416707
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle.	10.276030850073303
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost.	16.749173575071705
The tree of forbidden priest.	6.915757778525558
O, father, will you?	13.083810128477943
Let me be the first to.	8.92722259643785
That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates.	10.734800574479872
Source of life.	5.646671179269495
And it’s extremely curious the smell.	12.861201994475142
Celery sauce.	11.219211239039288
Let me.	4.724641177281735
Mr Bloom inserted his nose.	15.495647371794178
Hm. Into the.	7.887269179618107
Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.	14.153787037545275
Almonds or.	10.743242539620338
No. Lemons it is.	7.8225878478318025
Ah no, that’s the soap.	10.936595906161912
O by the by that lotion.	13.551955911653247
I knew there was something on my mind.	14.829815678946902
Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning.	8.307248286219712
Hynes might have paid me that three shillings.	10.900319137046395
I could mention Meagher’s just to remind him.	9.963147440565784
Still if he works that paragraph.	15.92884819785307
Two and nine.	8.90149177870349
Bad opinion of me he’ll have.	9.78075104091259
Call tomorrow.	10.053221221999014
How much do I owe you?	9.704428910789382
Three and nine?	25.41229400198438
Two and nine, sir.	5.675369517661856
Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time.	5.906611504092318
Lose your customers that way.	5.309040647929689
Pubs do.	6.7719948155639615
Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.	11.892988820956445
Here’s this nobleman passed before.	9.624952693863106
Blown in from the bay.	15.125003143401388
Just went as far as turn back.	6.782047997970823
Always at home at dinnertime.	13.019513704387629
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.	8.829028792570021
Enjoying nature now.	4.715651494842666
Grace after meals.	8.994100600157003
After supper walk a mile.	8.731327753725099
Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit.	11.742383937324105
Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today.	10.098239525626271
Still you learn something.	9.300142788815743
See ourselves as others see us.	5.877680711600666
So long as women don’t mock what matter?	13.503389925483168
That’s the way to find out.	9.438853466347036
Ask yourself who is he now.	7.019291328165767
_The Mystery Man on the Beach_, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom.	7.830567477672368
Payment at the rate of one guinea per column.	11.513191523222368
And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh.	20.260262661331282
Corns on his kismet however.	12.569280127829476
Healthy perhaps absorb all the.	5.285397070463736
Whistle brings rain they say.	5.381168310194095
Must be some somewhere.	12.125539154425809
Salt in the Ormond damp.	18.47357766469058
The body feels the atmosphere.	10.093279998235552
Old Betty’s joints are on the rack.	18.382421211367053
Mother Shipton’s prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling.	14.677643153274278
No. Signs of rain it is.	7.61546570547391
The royal reader.	11.464663246749659
And distant hills seem coming nigh.	8.005234173317922
Howth.	25.535385961793953
Two, four, six, eight, nine.	7.2669487353085485
See.	18.814633242637697
Has to change or they might think it a house.	10.610126307040886
Grace Darling.	14.949365283168918
People afraid of the dark.	10.198553969086978
Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time.	3.9095739037497057
Jewels diamonds flash better.	6.3830759751025985
Women.	32.172570290454246
Light is a kind of reassuring.	18.255559520999064
Not going to hurt you.	8.33884560897362
Better now of course than long ago.	9.701945351739296
Country roads.	15.009292486789496
Run you through the small guts for nothing.	9.038522217998933
Still two types there are you bob against.	10.806858605960358
Scowl or smile.	7.490730322394942
Pardon! Not at all.	6.439231582357062
Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun.	11.249587389980972
Some light still.	7.023189573350055
Red rays are longest.	8.796283866838044

A star I see.	5.9591953149975305
Venus?	32.172570290454246
Can’t tell yet.	14.087330519304468
Two.	20.267449269082853
When three it’s night.	7.792909084352892
Were those nightclouds there all the time?	8.989262169101362
Looks like a phantom ship.	12.631484070607273
No. Wait.	16.96445551714952
Trees are they?	10.644254508583558
An optical illusion.	11.244563678125036
Mirage.	32.172570290454246
Land of the setting sun this.	12.235887591507591
Homerule sun setting in the southeast.	18.355871325242127
My native land, goodnight.	10.908582113361113
Dew falling.	12.72516319643597
Brings on white fluxions.	9.911885168613109
Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through.	8.439090677961733
Might get piles myself.	6.539837500948322
Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth.	9.278842836249607
Cut with grass or paper worst.	8.251823305067505
Friction of the position.	18.404873524276304
Like to be that rock she sat on.	7.737122993851066
O sweet little, you don’t know how nice you looked.	10.41036605875493
I begin to like them at that age.	10.910575930780553
Green apples.	15.009292486789496
Grab at all that offer.	17.377521691135772
Suppose it’s the only time we cross legs, seated.	9.40163718302403
Also the library today: those girl graduates.	9.832982946883805
Happy chairs under them.	4.682013631132808
But it’s the evening influence.	14.899926434683124
They feel all that.	5.5821314769027595
Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps.	7.303164353641671
Nightstock in Mat Dillon’s garden where I kissed her shoulder.	9.31075855740868
Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then.	10.794387048213611
June that was too I wooed.	16.312850063133297
The year returns.	9.758977735550639
Ye crags and peaks I’m with you once again.	6.3884081064750475
Life, love, voyage round your own little world.	7.91282176973858
And now?	11.553847650717305
Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity.	13.855917337719703
They take advantage.	13.662322080253595
All quiet on Howth now.	5.435133775724015
The distant hills seem.	10.16136757589852
Where we.	10.153914543633084
The rhododendrons.	12.599539896325004
I am a fool perhaps.	10.988347937992806
He gets the plums, and I the plumstones.	7.809992598472798
Where I come in.	6.448037117682931
All that old hill has seen.	14.125384714020653
Names change: that’s all.	6.354590008105819
Lovers: yum yum.	9.660671642340054
Tired I feel now.	7.220252447086044
Will I get up?	15.133754487529826
O wait.	7.284158982183184
Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch.	15.520409716496761
She kissed me.	4.363270088700101
Never again.	5.364875352896063
My youth.	12.732750137725292
Only once it comes.	7.8079872519479405
Take the train there tomorrow.	8.420776227985964
No. Returning not the same.	11.803074869286624
Like kids your second visit to a house.	7.239107108827355
The new I want.	9.69426608341992
Nothing new under the sun.	8.748553013650644
Care of P.	6.658237060233085
Dolphin’s Barn.	18.30283558843349
Are you not happy in your?	12.378279721659734
Naughty darling.	10.627487742162224
At Dolphin’s barn charades in Luke Doyle’s house.	9.681806582657684
Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty.	5.698942619289589
Molly too.	4.66219583534958
Eightyseven that was.	5.901119183842478
Year before we.	10.434991141666332
And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits.	15.02727204269173
Curious she an only child, I an only child.	7.951726773958216
So it returns.	11.245971900195425
Think you’re escaping and run into yourself.	9.958083681611617
Longest way round is the shortest way home.	8.559170348765823
And just when he and she.	8.827001960653282
Circus horse walking in a ring.	12.404321213275528
Rip van Winkle we played.	8.757631516795396
Rip: tear in Henny Doyle’s overcoat.	12.834600803207197
Van: breadvan delivering.	9.81607826668818
Winkle: cockles and periwinkles.	9.152039785214123
Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back.	8.85740958491203
Moorish eyes.	5.455646160485135
Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.	9.97448624381906
All changed.	11.460465231628643
Forgotten.	25.535385961793953
The young are old.	9.282289831087327
His gun rusty from the dew.	14.964700822398838
Ba. What is that flying about?	14.791788165355328
Swallow?	32.172570290454246
Bat probably.	7.674379201751439
Thinks I’m a tree, so blind.	11.380420467707047
Have birds no smell?	12.790490431167715
Metempsychosis.	32.172570290454246
They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief.	10.664526398827572
Weeping willow.	14.833002552262101
Ba. There he goes.	12.030852465169593
Funny little beggar.	8.93317040799552
Wonder where he lives.	13.200882082658504
Belfry up there.	5.221771354404977
Very likely.	10.537498549673511
Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity.	18.00350213529954
Bell scared him out, I suppose.	8.531260144309341
Mass seems to be over.	9.926811101565063
Could hear them all at it.	7.8391349926240474
Pray for us.	8.854108919333541
And pray for us.	5.758220310973663
And pray for us.	5.758220310973663
Good idea the repetition.	9.163808296393444
Same thing with ads.	9.784596861280042
Buy from us.	6.119820769829243
And buy from us.	5.746508345263079
Yes, there’s the light in the priest’s house.	13.957958848410714
Their frugal meal.	8.630876448592641
Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom’s.	10.899004727815429
Twentyeight it is.	5.172173591328579
Two houses they have.	6.386819272771283
Gabriel Conroy’s brother is curate.	15.546224668021898
Ba. Again.	11.805479040839682
Wonder why they come out at night like mice.	13.09846985605898
They’re a mixed breed.	13.198083450624026
Birds are like hopping mice.	9.24405125760961
What frightens them, light or noise?	12.022724937938637
Better sit still.	6.998812938635363
All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles.	9.892005622003653
Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands.	12.991980024616172
Weeny bones.	8.882820924305548
Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white.	10.186440815282435
Colours depend on the light you see.	8.748122082694916
Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish.	11.09596796596078
Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase.	16.02248484076181
Colour of brown turf.	10.922850139201135
Say you never see them with three colours.	14.072702256932747
Not true.	9.276010825015183
That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the _City Arms_ with the letter em on her forehead.	12.384645088448652
Body fifty different colours.	8.402827671147627
Howth a while ago amethyst.	10.782021713988248
Glass flashing.	12.599539896325004
That’s how that wise man what’s his name with the burning glass.	11.387100562054856
Then the heather goes on fire.	10.196112340222035
Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light.	8.241150754665979
Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.	12.429452036305888
Archimedes.	32.172570290454246
I have it! My memory’s not so bad.	16.9026563007076
Ba. Who knows what they’re always flying for.	11.574067124080875
Insects?	32.172570290454246
That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling.	16.898074952423105
Might be the one bit me, come back to see.	12.717855459185778
Birds too.	4.66219583534958
Never find out.	5.322085745175834
Or what they say.	7.826528967832975
Like our small talk.	8.696287029683111
And says she and says he.	7.338333268734327
Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back.	10.519970994316067
Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires.	8.477500502298065
Dreadful life sailors have too.	4.54953061248846
Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows.	8.269167569766227
_Faugh a ballagh!_ Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow.	8.884409521330234
Married too.	4.66219583534958
Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere.	12.785639385013187
No ends really because it’s round.	9.128282509548484
Wife in every port they say.	7.783108190189391
She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again.	8.816836865829892
If ever he does.	10.1669263181728
Smelling the tail end of ports.	11.715635036297138
How can they like the sea?	18.462013965920892
Yet they do.	7.520400298604067
The anchor’s weighed.	21.62118980564208
Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck.	13.159291142384372
Well.	20.267449269082853
And the tephilim no what’s this they call it poor papa’s father had on his door to touch.	12.68611480185106
That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.	10.797228328715478
Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers.	16.452443232984795
Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that’s the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him.	8.978654136467588
Do fish ever get seasick?	11.007222867701474
Then you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones’ locker, moon looking down so peaceful.	6.934404273804783
Not my fault, old cockalorum.	13.582363410555455
A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars.	6.880392495516088
They floated, fell: they faded.	10.684310725030924
The shepherd’s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst.	13.052184056025855
From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges.	10.998869877735459
By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: _Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup races!_ and from the door of Dignam’s house a boy ran out and called.	8.157153113668398
Twittering the bat flew here, flew there.	6.292094473255553
Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey.	8.251443930534274
Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.	8.23140616433259
He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake.	6.518776896846813
And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.	4.114507685874098
Life those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot.	11.245390124947887
Irish Lights board.	9.06656776739633
Penance for their sins.	13.040483617539483
Coastguards too.	4.66219583534958
Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat.	8.540305837350358
Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin’s King, throwing them the sack of old papers.	13.442060914196482
Bears in the zoo.	27.747488546980133
Filthy trip.	14.949365283168918
Drunkards out to shake up their livers.	13.459658474704693
Puking overboard to feed the herrings.	7.90607209912931
Nausea.	32.172570290454246
And the women, fear of God in their faces.	14.244220907909716
Milly, no sign of funk.	19.677261480802716
Her blue scarf loose, laughing.	6.384569697792356
Don’t know what death is at that age.	14.25854902962711
And then their stomachs clean.	9.600711627310492
But being lost they fear.	7.704244248920455
When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin.	10.665165826628954
I didn’t want to.	7.152227127091563
Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood.	11.747357906668594
Frightening them with masks too.	6.0152598459391955
Throwing them up in the air to catch them.	8.505961433751734
I’ll murder you.	9.97372220794674
Is it only half fun?	20.60303509562163
Or children playing battle.	10.137242252682398
Whole earnest.	12.570867676935075
How can people aim guns at each other.	6.564147309957102
Sometimes they go off.	7.600762024154315
Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash.	7.0422600385116425
Calomel purge I got her for that.	6.314654188474228
After getting better asleep with Molly.	6.775771983324569
Very same teeth she has.	7.702689007837279
What do they love?	21.338072023597267
Another themselves?	18.94572461492184
But the morning she chased her with the umbrella.	15.8705976606151
Perhaps so as not to hurt.	13.857048928756708
I felt her pulse.	13.579659242724782
Ticking.	32.172570290454246
Little hand it was: now big.	11.760653700450566
Dearest Papli.	12.965080807049691
All that the hand says when you touch.	12.53755133237753
Loved to count my waistcoat buttons.	8.297279331276634
Her first stays I remember.	7.474687864169919
Made me laugh to see.	5.574341606672071
Little paps to begin with.	5.733401021521673
Left one is more sensitive, I think.	8.317397715776607
Mine too.	4.66219583534958
Nearer the heart?	14.655065510356037
Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me.	5.192533369232489
Frightened she was when her nature came on her first.	12.3807661933524
Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too.	7.182664920038522
Brings back her girlhood.	11.115069776528577
Gibraltar.	20.267449269082853
Looking from Buena Vista.	9.19810086580461
O’Hara’s tower.	24.38163799760216
The seabirds screaming.	11.316877381572302
Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family.	7.059159667316687
Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines.	8.45411203678797
Looking out over the sea she told me.	7.847795780112908
Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.	16.118337059081842
I always thought I’d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht.	15.925070774504034
_Buenas noches, señorita.	8.672671882415418
El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa_.	6.8928639775454466
Why me?	8.464970858319843
Because you were so foreign from the others.	14.789153229525736
This weather makes you dull.	8.803483463826659
Must be getting on for nine by the light.	14.825817248217248
Too late for _Leah, Lily of Killarney._ No. Might be still up.	7.431742377439476
Call to the hospital to see.	9.253059937314706
Hope she’s over.	8.781097498509004
Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan’s.	4.138689774596518
Got my own back there.	6.4996833752226
Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince.	14.708268866028597
Mistake to hit back.	5.141445234124425
No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves.	15.129884107365026
Always want to be swilling in company.	13.280232286811321
Afraid to be alone like a child of two.	15.788063303452775
Suppose he hit me.	6.016908201341461
Look at it other way round.	13.816712042165042
Not so bad then.	8.75997962870082
Perhaps not to hurt he meant.	12.371166906330284
Three cheers for Israel.	11.535675903920804
Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth.	9.33805572554823
Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea.	9.812702168971736
The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town.	12.663052360475076
Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow.	11.13688053661721
Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know.	6.443539056330907
Anyhow she wants the money.	6.053789626430846
Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised.	11.525727747269725
Strange name.	6.446083459570686
Takes it for granted we’re going to pop off first.	11.361582469435149
That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer’s that looked at me.	8.072790908888997
Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium.	13.843232594719348
Her widow’s mite.	21.882727890351187
Well?	18.814633242637697
What do you expect her to do?	15.271553557636269
Must wheedle her way along.	7.763002185524348
Widower I hate to see.	6.1394434067297
Looks so forlorn.	11.84084524736698
Poor man O’Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here.	8.123805283660284
The sewage.	11.219211239039288
Hopeless.	32.172570290454246
Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him.	7.533840670504517
Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron.	13.552237460909547
Ladies’ grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain.	7.593013504684533
Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say.	5.590740473120847
Ugly: no woman thinks she is.	7.29390708009208
Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die.	8.436884050509407
See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick.	8.78174600318526
U.	12.767692980896975
p: up.	4.887050564640962
Fate that is.	5.213795739387887
He, not me.	7.7682248988243
Also a shop often noticed.	9.979859482479679
Curse seems to dog it.	5.306466119822706
Dreamt last night?	13.293492499457091
Something confused.	12.378863073457003
She had red slippers on.	7.669366407110112
Turkish.	25.535385961793953
Wore the breeches.	10.015937201483501
Suppose she does?	22.04921605315795
Would I like her in pyjamas?	18.510523080671934
Damned hard to answer.	9.020442605023169
Nannetti’s gone.	11.909888856354891
Mailboat.	32.172570290454246
Near Holyhead by now.	4.517936073404047
Must nail that ad of Keyes’s.	4.50895047808034
Work Hynes and Crawford.	7.207864502739765
Petticoats for Molly.	7.960904898088337
She has something to put in them.	10.276534299441686
What’s that?	8.269961906369119
Might be money.	9.55236807958707
Mr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand.	19.494598725337934
He brought it near his eyes and peered.	13.928666462924726
Letter?	32.172570290454246
No. Can’t read.	16.719266660905213
Better.	25.535385961793953
Who could count them?	8.876706532052047
Never know what you find.	19.042935774968775
Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck.	14.67496868703687
Parcels post.	15.137709510736567
Children always want to throw things in the sea.	11.584435566285999
Trust?	32.172570290454246
Bread cast on the waters.	12.687437731263437
What’s this?	15.647280966578519
Bit of stick.	9.241752929476341
O! Exhausted that female has me.	6.099221845937009
Not so young now.	7.1613547662389285
Will she come here tomorrow?	11.971822710910574
Wait for her somewhere for ever.	11.925044611804909
Must come back.	6.2773228545625415
Murderers do.	6.7719948155639615
Will I?	12.336652607210542
Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot.	11.380413289575168
Write a message for her.	4.747913836546323
Might remain.	15.137709510736567
I.	7.73347927951542
Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning.	7.546295861861832
Useless.	32.172570290454246
Washed away.	6.141071532529181
Tide comes here.	5.3385816996244655
Saw a pool near her foot.	8.507113120237456
Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs.	13.814642664424348
All these rocks with lines and scars and letters.	6.298155438880942
O, those transparent! Besides they don’t know.	9.50418170852629
What is the meaning of that other world.	11.13284668116461
I called you naughty boy because I do not like.	8.953706553541835
AM.	32.172570290454246
A.	9.56954361575378
No room.	9.277321037511381
Let it go.	7.032992295617883
Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot.	15.279083529417496
Nothing grows in it.	3.8908465020217506
All fades.	14.833002552262101
No fear of big vessels coming up here.	5.655900446020178
Except Guinness’s barges.	21.496193956582076
Round the Kish in eighty days.	6.423451248746844
Done half by design.	10.478473277418583
He flung his wooden pen away.	6.110167976347635
The stick fell in silted sand, stuck.	7.406086119453303
Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn’t.	12.74771032986954
Chance.	32.172570290454246
We’ll never meet again.	9.728797933881305
But it was lovely.	17.339629103895337
Goodbye, dear.	9.935028811304827
Thanks.	20.267449269082853
Made me feel so young.	11.084138248540942
Short snooze now if I had.	7.82826985166809
Must be near nine.	12.872495653970166
Liverpool boat long gone.	6.22197255184106
Not even the smoke.	10.009670583668026
And she can do the other.	11.116394059550315
Did too.	4.66219583534958
And Belfast.	15.101486301579408
I won’t go.	9.620915988220547
Race there, race back to Ennis.	15.611509606388802
Let him.	4.4174410578659895
Just close my eyes a moment.	7.234285543817729
Won’t sleep, though.	12.664387375359892
Half dream.	12.693542893567423
It never comes the same.	7.161961955140968
Bat again.	5.364875352896063
No harm in him.	4.5528537881414675
Just a few.	17.805842151952913
O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon _señorita_ young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.	6.755335922878396
A bat flew.	8.338358540389397
Here.	12.056869439375285
Here.	12.056869439375285
Far in the grey a bell chimed.	14.647658043535744
Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed.	10.887358839043994
Just for a few Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	13.551053531218281
The clock on the mantelpiece in the priest’s house cooed where Canon O’Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.	11.445156049281284
were taking tea and sodabread and butter and fried mutton chops with catsup and talking about Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	6.672101022751576
Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that, was Gerty MacDowell, and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo.	13.709203363395217

Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Hoopsa boyaboy hoopsa! Universally that person’s acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high mind’s ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent nature’s incorrupted benefaction.	7.675162236850427
For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined?	7.948776831490667
It is not why therefore we shall wonder if, as the best historians relate, among the Celts, who nothing that was not in its nature admirable admired, the art of medicine shall have been highly honoured.	11.819947589418264
Not to speak of hostels, leperyards, sweating chambers, plaguegraves, their greatest doctors, the O’Shiels, the O’Hickeys, the O’Lees, have sedulously set down the divers methods by which the sick and the relapsed found again health whether the malady had been the trembling withering or loose boyconnell flux.	8.643261424175456
Certainly in every public work which in it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance commensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having preconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in being said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not up to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so far from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient in that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the copiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed scarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an inconsiderable emolument was provided.	7.868355662930789
To her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be molestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent mothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received eternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the case was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying desire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be received into that domicile.	7.887767293003083
O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother, that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt! Before born bliss babe had.	8.631053013958132

A couch by midwives attended with wholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were now done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs there is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her case not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various latitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine and human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence conducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of mothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her thereto to lie in, her term up.	6.9849304585097425

Stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.	5.712763660593227
Of that house A.	6.951380138193424
Horne is lord.	10.420809183452914
Seventy beds keeps he there teeming mothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale so God’s angel to Mary quoth.	8.039453380374491
Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless.	8.864462831215436
Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons thrice an hundred.	7.364875893759711
Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding wariest ward.	8.101200372196342
Lo, levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland’s westward welkin.	9.288567038276396
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.	6.539836741511177
Christ’s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch.	11.88829299641547
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne’s house.	7.200194563019848
Loth to irk in Horne’s hall hat holding the seeker stood.	8.61977970161201
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered.	7.070282151178233
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed.	13.82811512073987
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so young then had looked.	10.53505144668391
Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes his word winning.	8.674767170195251
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared.	6.963099338921029
Glad after she was that ere adread was.	8.223606967297082
Her he asked if O’Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O’Hare Doctor in heaven was.	7.662424778717463
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful.	12.381893002368084
All she there told him, ruing death for friend so young, algate sore unwilling God’s rightwiseness to withsay.	8.13523115693928
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men’s oil to his limbs.	11.27061873873414
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness.	9.907922061212389
He heard her sad words, in held hat sad staring.	11.2243305037215
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other.	6.097025440948127
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	12.297055988787369
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.	16.532055181634554
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be.	10.807905571999719
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s birth.	12.035729937059498
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house.	11.07265527005739
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid.	13.61235701725942
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless.	7.385543624289672
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat.	9.132611410271377
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon.	15.038421387603988
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.	10.368784526436864
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there.	13.723337411673402
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile.	13.443951303786749
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility.	11.87901341548312
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle.	11.311269245541778
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery.	8.609671224962735
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment.	10.827468947855703
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously.	9.777819007165197
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles.	15.052513186485154
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer.	7.414247644084515
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so.	7.834209825574617
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress.	11.467793102144533
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain.	10.799429037276298
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.	11.142589277352945
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each.	7.202731970460513
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.	10.43283104252992
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile.	14.003649510590433
Thanked be Almighty God.	6.4201313440862595
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast.	8.336320952272285
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now.	9.919707366819535
Meseems it dureth overlong.	9.198594328062736
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently.	11.893724792471438
But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.	10.001492592981014
And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her next.	13.317885024225555
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness.	12.243914927944513
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup.	9.282921311827327
Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.	17.414329002944815
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might.	14.186572917846958
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir Leopold.	9.36388303349177
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.	12.997575902216479
Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave.	9.853631007147403
For they were right witty scholars.	13.39323204965007
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case).	9.071650907796307
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die.	10.573048314962199
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy.	8.90145249525559
A redress God grant.	9.681995180784702
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and the babe to die.	10.193157687225016
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack.	8.06299437071521
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved.	9.636386262230232
To whom young Stephen had these words following: Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk.	8.068561125509103
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.	8.075841435139122
But, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life?	9.539414565923023
For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief.	10.148142021455051
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.	7.863478591892563
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends.	7.152736473802202
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead.	14.370958349249587
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do.	9.357929861708632
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever.	11.211981582288812
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith, patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with, _effectu secuto_, or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides.	9.504280995055865
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded.	8.981720170102767
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life.	6.760101766239647
A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said dissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.	10.335228901699512
That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word.	11.471053061548265
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.	14.46073179878512
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.	9.661547066679761
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all accounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores.	11.475085180656695
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray.	8.812466934946535
Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment.	11.220589425775986
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone.	7.747397279362271
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay.	9.674639972691514
See ye here.	5.130729272474703
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he writ.	10.8968026964829
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore.	8.771491497834356
His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions.	10.874521591025701
What means this?	8.935385300363452
Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time.	8.8301515659287
Mark me now.	5.6327862674523965
In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.	9.638705196212696
This is the postcreation.	19.878728762006535
_Omnis caro ad te veniet_.	7.384497882894177
No question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly that She hath an _omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem_, that is to wit, an almightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin.	8.41445418218827
But here is the matter now.	9.244849337439042
Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her creature, _vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio_, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages, _parceque M.	8.681494132001944
Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder_ transubstantiality _oder_ consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality.	5.197213432863078
And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word.	11.622651698181478
A pregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.	10.536780961947814
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship.	6.507433519519392
With will will we withstand, withsay.	7.644881847950727
Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _Staboo Stabella_ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: _The first three months she was not well, Staboo,_ when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard.	9.171286646810714
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain seize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred.	9.266522444307515
In Horne’s house rest should reign.	12.769339027381667
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days.	9.592590542411871
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership.	10.731657246318782
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin.	13.294490136390579
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium_ till she was there unmaided.	8.365656037772805
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their _Maid’s Tragedy_ that was writ for a like twining of lovers: _To bed, to bed_ was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals.	10.382756135438397
An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion.	6.964113368256471
Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come.	8.390475098853866
Greater love than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend.	12.037622766478476
Go thou and do likewise.	11.605957913040067

Remember, Erin, thy generations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum.	9.342146170914617
Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian.	8.429473335557807
Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously?	8.509540937640022
Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money.	8.38327594984386
But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever.	8.187871375783459
And thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth.	10.416555784567038
This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that was foraneous.	13.713683835898756

And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being.	8.142779356928058

And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.	7.948036209820164
Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _Etienne chanson_ but he loudly bid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic longstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order, a penny for him who finds the pea.	9.324140987257657
A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back.	7.241639930564807
Came now the storm that hist his heart.	6.227243668391991
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry.	8.160140676831793
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm.	11.311893677830277
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour.	10.564536705333847
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead.	14.188736781898662
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall.	7.809305318024253
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.	11.880128769087872
But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words?	12.739561001644223
No, for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away.	10.062840315485236
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other?	13.573457674615556
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either.	19.449757593676733
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal?	13.649709745663166
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle.	11.610797414494936
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon?	13.772215880212803
Heard?	32.172570290454246
Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding (which he had not done).	13.193954346459307
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show.	11.909754400214068
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away?	12.161605165037072
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law.	11.238378310756422
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it?	9.241510839381744
Yes, Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.	11.776506156243496
For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild.	9.1402172057598
Wherein, O wretched company, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.	11.721022106251514
So Thursday sixteenth June Patk.	7.894045130335256
Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.	6.73493597678588
Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without.	10.292591170867185
The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire.	7.231223755723241
All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness.	10.256663642886402
But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came.	11.303863134169644
In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first.	8.443775876245356

Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he to Andrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s.	10.026882402455957
There Leop.	12.200680240034972
Bloom of Crawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin.	9.964248309156071

Leop.	25.535385961793953
Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue.	12.115530451663716
’Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king’s bible.	12.85465180218152
Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear.	10.057916724558835
In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.	10.287214990500578
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk.	14.044573688032225
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat.	9.645338811916833
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip.	8.561830170661118
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother’s son of them would burst their sides.	11.660865401831092
The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale.	13.011773242329681
Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague.	11.117767022846895
But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it.	11.924142133761817
_Mort aux vaches_, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too.	11.857911395386367
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes.	12.661073186585394
One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge.	10.546021909039084
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him.	9.083595545538174
What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all?	13.806409793982576
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he.	9.108420020147266
I can scarce believe ’tis so bad, says he.	7.201031317384238
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street.	8.137000843430696
I question with you there, says he.	7.963746689272353
More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue.	6.717847196452891
Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.	12.020498814820415
Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.	11.495823504976004
He’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he.	16.43868433567616
Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop.	10.468280821171499
I conceive you, says Mr Dixon.	11.060057220747327
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose.	13.904137483277331
True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock.	10.840921958753862
He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.	10.830146903914237
What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself.	10.052765068756765
So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly.	11.83551590592196
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.	12.432204991576846
Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content.	12.259014605279777
By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture.	11.762813459810955
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him.	8.09332232415368
Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground.	14.13012201540997
And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry’s orders.	11.533828224678132
There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters, says he.	12.310192250124725
I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me.	9.220100737910794
But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, _Bos Bovum_, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show.	11.320167773260186
After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name.	14.723877184982497
Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat.	12.523413074248937
In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt.	10.559312148153401
They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America.	7.90096583263903
Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: _—Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.	13.73069780531718
A man’s a man for a’ that._ Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars.	12.038278096260667
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on.	13.624000953540031
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend printed in fair italics: _Mr Malachi Mulligan.	7.978691979887594
Fertiliser and Incubator.	11.564019825102967
Lambay Island_.	14.509135749322695
His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed.	9.735881352234873
Well, let us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon.	14.424578121665276
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching.	8.765287948992391
Come, be seated, both.	9.904359130082991
’Tis as cheap sitting as standing.	8.017622724391197
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired.	10.204796310923557
It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made his heart weep.	9.00806762800897
To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party.	7.683184709082728
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named _Omphalos_ with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural.	9.23131974048644
Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for his pains.	15.041170706063655
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.	7.672905503784534
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it.	8.857302624368124
They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observed by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.	14.29557191164044
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle.	10.292775712956153
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention: _Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt_, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.	7.573052717880347
The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour.	12.469404164187015
Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional assistance we could give?	11.480949346046367
Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place.	10.207343448286414
Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.	10.831327363107741
For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote himself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard.	8.889280675293852
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight.	8.715725005370945
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.	11.999802779843186
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.	10.333396026757722
_Mais bien sûr_, noble stranger, said he cheerily, _et mille compliments_.	6.8469413945223305
That you may and very opportunely.	10.421130718844148
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity.	8.552953680195118
But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things.	13.310373752052367
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a complacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.	9.702445369091361
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever.	9.22424365631241
I declare, I was never so touched in all my life.	9.4162330589456
God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days! Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.	10.20877768270646
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years.	8.842226052847854
But indeed, sir, I wander from the point.	14.430899588915947
How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys.	8.957561031538313
Maledicity! he exclaimed in anguish.	11.803642133753343
Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along! I could weep to think of it.	8.928349982766978
Then, though it had poured seven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse.	10.690849719875688
But beshrew me, he cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousand thunders, I know of a _marchand de capotes_, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom I can have for a _livre_ as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting.	11.129514699455537
Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a half bottle _avec lui_ in a circle of the best wits of the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, _ventre biche_, they have a rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak.	9.205950093831687
A drenching of that violence, he tells me, _sans blague_, has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world.	8.98465528480572
Pooh! A _livre!_ cries Monsieur Lynch.	12.69877069679005
The clumsy things are dear at a sou.	10.671907224299014
One umbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps.	9.336562886762437
No woman of any wit would wear one.	7.5794667420312
My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _il y a deux choses_ for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment.	9.930249498699874
The first, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), the first is a bath...	9.709464849744911
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge.	10.407448651949265
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while all were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bow to the company.	11.777578596544306
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry.	9.383034563305724
Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.	14.449437662476386
A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused you.	7.568557367784704
What, you dog?	30.72667924780232
Have you a way with them?	17.144706249216107
Gad’s bud, immensely so, said Mr Lynch.	12.343109949117206
The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater hospice.	15.79601987822864
Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin.	9.701166761834461
As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months.	12.964484537640766
Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly.	9.759402839134294
Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.	10.807500718447473
I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her.	10.838340209834989
The young surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward.	11.758319527778669
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _enceinte_ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy.	14.697499739848725
I want patience, said he, with those who, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling profession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth.	8.613184932011317
I am positive when I say that if need were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the human breast.	14.12791754335746
I cannot away with them.	7.1563236443560125
Malign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours?	14.424706185321465
And at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay?	11.007374635409592
Perish the thought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of Horne.	10.44611091327941
Having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door.	7.9169039224932405
A murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath.	8.636818858873108
Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.	10.093351615795003
To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity.	11.482513785048987
The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous _mots_ were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf.	8.577395371939383
But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin.	12.505502551721289
It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable.	9.55789124750184
To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat.	8.578887066086825
Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions.	10.794177676001484
To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the Supreme Being.	13.106777755306595
Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express his notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers.	12.180734364895649
The dressy young blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron.	11.365740177947147
I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her.	9.595243846893668
I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.	9.903505923926717
’Slife, I’ll be round with you.	7.197307101706034
I cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her.	6.487529536921816
All fell to praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household.	10.634694279140243
Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest.	7.369573885769601
But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together.	10.999110768438289
But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity?	9.61894518394452
Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled?	12.392881785277352
During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents?	10.208288665241295
Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received?	11.183735873778751
Or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, if report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer?	13.122593226996516
Far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then be it so.	11.413166196292295
Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate.	11.695086991485844
He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic.	11.207240182954795
It ill becomes him to preach that gospel.	9.649610345440664
Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare?	12.364254992124225
A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life.	5.887099376511932
If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him.	5.076118788310616
His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce.	7.622552307086468
The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.	7.604899884139268
The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born.	11.093141553389644
When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues.	9.51770100069604
In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain.	11.468454524435781
The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent.	10.101593402577386
Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac _foetus in foetu_ and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _Sturzgeburt,_ the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents—in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations.	9.12402277644437
The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.	10.024044520403354
An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses.	10.72216158574931
The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived.	9.975692290087599
It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man.	9.165637411819809
Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus.	7.305801670074161
Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.	9.900214847373245
But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror.	9.089731987308836
He conjured up the scene before them.	8.472798350533301
The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recess appeared...	6.343313981368415
Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked _Poison._ Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin.	9.38458785183282
I anticipated some such reception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame.	10.084230368021965
Yes, it is true.	16.17324811256158
I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.	8.835736246628429
And how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me.	8.653624643656466
Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus?	11.082994914505578
My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life.	10.216834518747994
It is what I tried to obliterate my crime.	15.460506836200487
Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited some), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out.	9.489453197011922
In vain! His spectre stalks me.	5.895978327883977
Dope is my only hope...	3.9567443064211774
Ah! Destruction! The black panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.	9.04127669429173
An instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station at ten past eleven.	10.29015349494874
He was gone.	13.332408288509642
Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host.	14.592847018848127
The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: _Lex talionis_.	9.333414988249551
The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done.	8.168636701422406
Malachias, overcome by emotion, ceased.	6.659830673826361
The mystery was unveiled.	9.783015897495414
Haines was the third brother.	14.630595840434113
His real name was Childs.	12.108322865051278
The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father.	9.242730284024171
He drank drugs to obliterate.	11.41061956468098
For this relief much thanks.	6.87391474683641
The lonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited.	11.02112244194501
No soul will live there.	5.504501810582554
The spider pitches her web in the solitude.	12.184903884030154
The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.	10.925415009316506
A curse is on it.	4.96367949750306
It is haunted.	24.42280905759411
Murderer’s ground.	15.776099195299944
What is the age of the soul of man?	16.358834513764645
As she hath the virtue of the chameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood.	10.37715224372452
No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds.	10.039353067915656
A score of years are blown away.	6.947265019288608
He is young Leopold.	12.449459323188742
There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.	10.2279061363335
That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s thought.	10.348296134101195
Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged traveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented handkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart?	11.7251308874661
tell me!) his studied baisemoins.	11.870037084341826
The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a month before.	11.975136757757229
Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons.	11.915908093085834
Who can say?	11.752743675975031
The wise father knows his own child.	9.27963163592711
He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the first.	11.546515281428025
Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal university.	12.071173103683552
Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.	13.068094582595307
They are entwined in nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant (_fiat!_) light shall flood the world.	9.176041895953594
Did heart leap to heart?	9.550193526851602
Nay, fair reader.	14.545009826365183
She is the bride of darkness, a daughter of night.	11.717012676446448
She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day.	5.462964122525907
Name and memory solace thee not.	6.299060342706748
That youthful illusion of thy strength was taken from thee—and in vain.	7.315997631662639
No son of thy loins is by thee.	10.130111942756164
There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.	14.033559491800283
The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles of generations that have lived.	6.813416291474958
A region where grey twilight ever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars.	4.612716712945412
She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal.	9.343650098778834
Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull.	7.315151335276572
They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone.	6.367460875424704
Agendath is a waste land, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa.	13.970374725428831
Netaim, the golden, is no more.	14.522373231304899
And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion, the ghosts of beasts.	13.776924754941332
Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions.	7.5315646408660495
Elk and yak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come trooping to the sunken sea, _Lacus Mortis_.	9.483973292156152
Ominous revengeful zodiacal host! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of the sun.	7.52200758882256
Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible gulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood.	10.085907012462949
And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, ever virgin.	11.309952822703385
It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, the radiant.	15.271931881909778
How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call it gossamer.	10.132991323026289
It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling, writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead of Taurus.	7.129026273125036
Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at school together in Conmee’s time.	9.721786114327468
He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.	6.628640600236825
Where were they now?	10.667278750812931
Neither knew.	9.309383335394052
You have spoken of the past and its phantoms, Stephen said.	8.29599271718104
Why think of them?	13.528926908991044
If I call them into life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call?	14.046717207107505
I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.	6.432320267422717
That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius father.	8.118267263942082
All who wish you well hope this for you.	5.222397221209361
All desire to see you bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos.	10.293992418853437
I heartily wish you may not fail them.	6.8501163814815405
O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on the shoulder near him.	11.577391001724882
Have no fear.	8.355190955192425
He could not leave his mother an orphan.	14.31157098026942
The young man’s face grew dark.	11.970106401596647
All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss.	16.05621680188534
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart.	12.984310752677578
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more.	11.350224621472336
He told them of the race.	12.517717999350552
The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O.	8.86781569017112
Madden up.	4.963090012978215
She was leading the field.	9.351878719811667
All hearts were beating.	10.234285079495466
Even Phyllis could not contain herself.	9.968579710172163
She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah! Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her.	7.593731865633785
All was lost now.	5.541334258563602
Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones.	13.162251286400345
Juno, she cried, I am undone.	20.46011786518789
But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook.	10.303917197074815
A tear fell: one only.	8.43336210540614
A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W.	9.071225409898654
Lane.	25.535385961793953
Four winners yesterday and three today.	6.66283916493007
What rider is like him?	8.850199095976352
Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter is still his.	9.469296641581952
Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.	12.51574781539023
She is not the filly that she was.	8.481178722144348
Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another.	9.766146337137124
By gad, sir, a queen of them.	7.563405289818196
Do you remember her, Vincent?	24.236402893149403
I wish you could have seen my queen today, Vincent said.	8.3950965269526
How young she was and radiant (Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, I do not know the right name of it.	7.684741316706645
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us.	8.534812193604386
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge.	9.448975406115085
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close.	14.026305413052109
A week ago she lay ill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.	8.650597808856396
She is more taking then.	8.389754948203825
Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulled her fill as we reclined together.	8.078720337739213
And in your ear, my friend, you will not think who met us as we left the field.	14.547855493962105
Conmee himself! He was walking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page.	11.03226357948612
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her.	8.12538759126171
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries.	11.115010342688402
But he had been kind.	19.770680533459508
In going by he had blessed us.	9.504765025214091
The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.	4.581343086836793
If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely.	12.420334005206325
He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.	12.726829189346986
Warily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence.	5.784066718915062
His soul is far away.	7.851214965994742
It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born.	15.929677932259713
Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods.	10.971365664397544
Do you not think it, Stephen?	18.85976300620006
Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law.	9.755394153864094
The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation.	10.131653718063072
However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all.	12.312178018590263
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop.	8.040472267607155
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarlet appearance.	10.339334276838446
He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn.	10.776322947601024
Eventually, however, both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.	11.501653160909148
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life.	7.840913147357345
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity.	6.126960804981368
The debaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital.	15.187400484018857
The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic.	10.412006857263558
Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway.	15.115018043573814
There too, opposite to him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom.	7.4587778229618475
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden.	9.520331454148856
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan.	7.520214342640597
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.	7.468618466518757
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S.	9.669596985886718
Dedalus’ (Div.	10.991540638720688
Scep.) contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods.	7.96838506963858
Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangible phenomena.	9.811796301341925
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can.	9.075587324863976
There may be, it is true, some questions which science cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted by Mr L.	8.95956644844073
Bloom (Pubb.	14.14414232226188
Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti, a mixture of both?	7.007131974079886
This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the _nisus formativus_ of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position, _succubitus felix_, of the passive element.	12.138195420865271
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant mortality.	9.889308679942204
Mr M.	6.348749478321382
Mulligan (Hyg.	11.563441288541322
et Eug.	14.509135749322695
Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc.	7.417892739092084
by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust.	5.8743219473979025
These factors, he alleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity posters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers and sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he said, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race.	7.757346075690606
Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner.	8.440650995662432
Mr J.	4.907412681013932
Crotthers (Disc.	11.563441288541322
Bacc.) attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official, culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide.	9.33541439460313
Although the former (we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative.	9.269215227935167
In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.	11.848091951112526
An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V.	10.522903041584584
Lynch (Bacc.	10.066374546823265
Arith.) that both natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.	9.186472607028525
Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause.	8.365811526450853
Nature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though productive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is nevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest.	9.039645965400304
Mr S.	4.672979226442925
Dedalus’ (Div.	10.991540638720688
Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.	6.424658400058767
In a recent public controversy with Mr L.	8.390443135043828
Bloom (Pubb.	14.14414232226188
Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A.	9.265711224144763

I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual congress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own.	11.978676974571602
At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.	11.629611197864016
Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy _accouchement._ It had been a weary weary while both for patient and doctor.	8.451568437649627
All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman had manfully helped.	9.290108278246326
She had.	8.802818682196648
She had fought the good fight and now she was very very happy.	13.253340765143983
Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.	12.295036326322013
Reverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband.	11.407416929083722
And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces.	11.066238534236277
He is older now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet in the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious second accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch.	12.131976186194072
O Doady, loved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days.	10.98070469660894
God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose.	8.697017614333216
Young hopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle.	11.736488504074256
And so time wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here.	6.249391440016945
No, let no sigh break from that bosom, dear gentle Mina.	11.691144204018176
And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest.	10.285100046016604
He knows and will call in His own good time.	7.241389895844341
You too have fought the good fight and played loyally your man’s part.	7.964479710871567
Sir, to you my hand.	9.366124173630407
Well done, thou good and faithful servant! There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait.	11.212394414506436
He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise.	10.791875646018369
Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.	11.774818374222406
Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.	9.879938037268387
The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a _flair,_ for the cruder things of life.	10.388724467245806
A scene disengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures.	11.101604498840993
A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert shock.	9.42755803979702
A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.	6.839551854631264
He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the _piazzetta_ giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (_alles Vergängliche_) in her glad look.	10.668671264497894
Mark this farther and remember.	7.138206890441336
The end comes suddenly.	9.286139037651061
Enter that antechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces.	6.453763527933178
Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent.	9.320211289702367
Quietude of custody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago.	7.417809196944792
Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.	6.424891681004956
A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there.	4.993710371614269
Nurse Callan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon coming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a milligramme.	8.272035603848586
They hark him on.	4.859779628603524
The door! It is open?	19.70786597460955
Ha! They are out, tumultuously, off for a minute’s race, all bravely legging it, Burke’s of Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal.	10.228687821953821

Ward of watching in Horne’s house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.	9.620148434430613
Then all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in going: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?	10.330861448914392
The air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence celestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny _coelum._ God’s air, the Allfather’s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.	6.807837349419269

Dost envy Darby Dullman there with his Joan?	12.175501639524263
A canting jay and a rheumeyed curdog is all their progeny.	10.429869683837985
Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead gasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer.	13.512611097730977
Copulation without population! No, say I! Herod’s slaughter of the innocents were the truer name.	10.971311976348462
Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile cohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins.	5.289260555032473
A truce to threnes and trentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty years of it, regret them not.	6.1849104831994905

And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I’ll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...	10.41901637005989
MRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don’t tell me! Nice adviser! BLOOM: Because it didn’t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.	11.326148094651543

MRS BREEN: Too...	3.8125484406030017
BLOOM: Yes.	13.091896348522544
And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O’Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...	8.574483658807052

Not by a long shot if I know it.	11.219950058321016
I don’t see it, that’s all.	7.945662317975624
No born gentleman, no-one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct.	11.591880064598428
One of those, my lord.	12.050953539837197
A plagiarist.	14.509135749322695
A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur.	10.570079243203661
It’s perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion.	13.448792458308313
The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.	7.722706265211276

BEAUFOY: _(His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.)_ You funny ass, you! You’re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don’t think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.	10.155170147029729

MARY DRISCOLL: _(Indignantly.)_ I’m not a bad one.	9.95230466210479
I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.	11.229061645773886
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	18.180950319393446
MARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.	12.559681344007537
BLOOM: _(In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.)_ I treated you white.	7.714077633308463
I gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.	6.762964339704877

MARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin.	13.586577544303386
He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result.	14.822120283754458
And he interfered twict with my clothing.	14.99779726483845
BLOOM: She counterassaulted.	20.50248347347784
MARY DRISCOLL: _(Scornfully.)_ I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had.	11.785821307946073
I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it quiet.	11.739515576420715

They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand jury.	14.646345764492194
He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal.	15.11014226583663
A sevenmonths’ child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent.	11.095663001785846
There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family.	13.784161579943325
An acclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell’s wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever...._ _(Renewed laughter.	8.185211815702427

We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice.	9.549952507786555
My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny.	10.196921834907387
The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client’s native place, the land of the Pharaoh.	9.4281391711867
_Prima facie_, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing.	11.448763265383846
Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated.	11.619663382323433
I would deal in especial with atavism.	9.076196435310083
There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client’s family.	11.465865001759544
If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold—one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book.	9.472128479701922
He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler’s weak chest.	13.346104839305399
His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions.	8.862263663122652
Not all there, in fact.	9.968343348895027
BLOOM: _(Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar’s vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole’s eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead.	10.220359249551578

By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas.	10.34961348886578
The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle.	10.616120195228554
I say it and I say it emphatically, without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with.	9.544068421813687
The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter.	8.565642973876962

My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her.	9.722076211925911
He wants to go straight.	17.994127488584727
I regard him as the whitest man I know.	8.048370387794657
He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown.	10.706650390253245

He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch.	8.984210498108117
He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the _Theatre Royal_ at a command performance of _La Cigale_.	14.002402825734567
I deeply inflamed him, he said.	4.168049356632009
He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time.	8.348043366031957
He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled _The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays_.	8.38870533698269

Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person.	18.43394707004577
Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker’s one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen.	8.941822783672112
Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour.	10.16304778490017
I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.	11.355091799132484

MRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck’s head couped or.	9.47906435623723
He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up.	7.473920704757744
He urged me (Stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me.) to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.	9.73514011719876
THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: _(In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.)_ Also me.	6.529469389668746
Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland.	12.857624323239964
My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob _Centaur._ This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady.	7.973267601896867
I have it still.	13.183028651547863
It represents a partially nude señorita, frail and lovely (his wife, as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard.	9.074911079550127
He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison.	15.612042444490461
He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.	11.994594191689202

You are falling.	17.48369483456288
On the hands down! BLOOM: _(Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)_ Truffles! _(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)_ BELLO: _(With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer’s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moorcock’s feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.)_ Footstool!

Curse me for a fool that didn’t buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about.	9.707369716999425
Just my infernal luck, curse it.	4.702662834020663
And that Goddamned outsider _Throwaway_ at twenty to one.	6.737092698899521

BELLO: _(Points to his whores.)_ As they are now so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits.	10.216321670241728
Tape measurements will be taken next your skin.	9.462381761597262
You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to the diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice.	6.879261825562884
Alice will feel the pullpull.	9.682625741128016

It was dear Gerald.	16.96688820138913
He got that kink, fascinated by sister’s stays.	11.014469944523976

Do it standing, sir! I’ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles.	12.568056679252052
Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you’ll find I’m a martinet.	14.464060135105363

THE SINS OF THE PAST: _(In a medley of voices.)_ He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black church.	11.637963015047891
Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in D’Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox.	8.597675077057337
By word and deed he frankly encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises.	5.939624279219111
In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males.	6.141515560487461
And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see?	9.997494076468344
Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?	9.695566318528519

His bangle bracelets fall.)_ BELLO: _(Satirically.)_ By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail.	8.391945376746937
Won’t that be nice?	16.100706059950873

BELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh’s the cook’s, a sandy one.	9.857510278382831
Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.	15.194025628943928
Drink me piping hot.	8.43332725964934
Hop! You will dance attendance or I’ll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush.	12.069644720450848

The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the _blasé_ man about town.	8.3031298616622

With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done.	9.192343094614762
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs.	10.553828428120934

His (Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral.	11.230034274470496
But how to get there was the rub.	16.25496654883073
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned.	10.194781269606752
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found.	13.380052956433554
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver street or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s.	9.927376326256185
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.	9.95262938913628
This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did.	13.246229368985956
So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance.	11.140640071560144
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey.	8.813085895967236
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _à propos_ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back.	11.35305070301478
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.	9.182989297270344
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the stonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right, while the other who was acting as his _fidus Achates_ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable.	9.81179239410191
Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.	10.457029851102407
_En route_ to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution _re_ the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out.	9.995141720217507
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.	11.640927034166264
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot.	10.303424182335426
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes.	11.618406768955314
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything.	7.892311956398642
You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the _demimonde_ ran away with a lot of £.	11.571944482160506
s.	7.595351801251561
d.	16.81846716713923
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically.	9.791602660348431
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting _confrères_ but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.	13.375918693336203
—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.	11.530023115785326
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps.	9.448895884016592
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox.	13.143140419680508
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a _quondam_ friend of his father’s, Gumley.	11.876111438641303
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.	12.054991102309963
—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.	5.566154066286607
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again, calling: —Night! Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.	10.793288932849103
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _qui vive_ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.	9.715010327992209
Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice.	12.109758476681762
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise.	11.994038773464252
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer.	12.798637146139612
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.	7.475912113223667
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.	7.278869037061465
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.	8.037855827652486
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings.	15.056235336825406
His friends had all deserted him.	4.544026761604565
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions.	12.44564290005211
No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to finish.	13.866051522707815
Anyhow he was all in.	8.091580526714703
—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’m on the rocks.	12.239240057063594
—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher.	14.417350813125308
Mr Garrett Deasy.	11.58308737011652
Try it.	4.158488578013023
You may mention my name.	7.736358294240216
—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man.	11.117616740889135
I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh.	18.80471676143131
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers.	17.950718475403338
—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.	12.590407453321422
Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street.	11.345029723080353
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob.	11.013840150558465
He was starving too though he hadn’t said a word about it.	8.316416655540884
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence.	12.071302610030699
However _haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera_ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished.	10.385151960463974
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful.	13.868870853832812
Whereas.	32.172570290454246
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing.	12.459161738313016
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.	17.14408212738117
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact.	10.737776377620012
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.	11.437374177312963
About biscuits he dimly remembered.	6.679913363220866
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.	10.426406148727377
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.	10.160435865203594
—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.	6.260892666233061
And so in point of fact they turned out to be.	8.40662574642528
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them.	6.953302561123575
—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman.	9.576133676389599
I’ll pay you back one time.	9.181359711066236
Who’s that with you?	10.375220522473818
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.	15.146739086227122
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there.	10.605780359095489
I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks, man.	13.58717169378136
God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa.	13.491566355823581
I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.	12.764872387605402
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe.	12.648001195658239
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.	10.617500892752824
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept.	11.847048240532795
He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.	10.438424204549777
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity.	8.540676679839063
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _rara avis_ altogether.	13.303434384464355
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.	9.84302802320996
Pretty thick that was certainly.	13.822130535916898
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite.	15.18410575937337
Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is: —He is down on his luck.	15.073879782393387
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.	17.93308443174581
At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively: —Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say.	10.180523858610597
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me.	6.86654897323547
But, leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?	17.162684810465485
—Half a crown, Stephen responded.	14.772535896989131
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.	9.038015686132947
—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does.	10.275887526184814
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds.	13.875946358253245
But, talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself?	12.816710748881727
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question.	8.924396590368213
And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station.	9.931561097872192
Simply fag out there for nothing.	9.304550692069068
I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?	11.70917382658408
—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.	10.933877248073156
—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on yesterday.	12.949505325112584
Where does he live at present?	12.036042210281304
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.	14.958872501928655
—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.	20.631323416443742
Why?	12.512270304170855
—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born _raconteur_ if ever there was one.	10.80316489380916
He takes great pride, quite legitimate, out of you.	5.1325809101741875
You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.	11.15437437302509
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or something like that.	10.998497294547168
—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes.	10.50823253410358
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals.	9.847956087769829
Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did.	10.786125753632223
But it wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.	12.425377031566061
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.	9.734090915583863
—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.	11.6057034856301
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less.	9.579686370477335
Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.	10.044084669557776
Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.	9.156736045386772
—_Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione?	5.894090922079066
Culo rotto!_ _—Intendiamoci.	13.988953787708232
Mezzo sovrano più..._ _—Dice lui, però!_ _—Mezzo._ _—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!_ _—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più..._ Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in.	9.235641229242903
—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.	10.797707003379706
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic _sangfroid_ to order these commodities quietly.	6.996353151562729
The _hoi polloi_ of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.	6.5673389593430604
Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over _voglio_, remarked to his _protégé_ in an audible tone of voice _à propos_ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious: —A beautiful language.	11.2802020499612
I mean for singing purposes.	11.482351335593687
Why do you not write your poetry in that language?	14.739040467787735
_Bella Poetria_! It is so melodious and full.	9.129969422978
_Belladonna.	32.172570290454246
Voglio._ Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering from lassitude generally, replied: —To fill the ear of a cow elephant.	10.65388612906922
They were haggling over money.	7.607342673429447
—Is that so?	12.40130960986295
Mr Bloom asked.	9.107186927768117
Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.	7.322595704940471
The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _tête-à-tête_ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed.	12.238549139819886
After which he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to.	12.169653455723582
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.	8.478699903242951
—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time, like names.	10.06026789221847
Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody.	11.010702400607448
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies.	10.346765366731745
What’s in a name?	12.269764977406554
—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred.	15.509361588476287
Of course.	8.46325260774837
Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.	8.957900611393104
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking: —And what might your name be?	10.495512386511406
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered: —Dedalus.	12.268062349578452
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.	9.003426332575318
—You know Simon Dedalus?	21.975282797297805
he asked at length.	12.53530461524904
—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.	8.575863649721283
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.	10.55364450250475
—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding.	12.913877590773799
—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.	16.590854408391397
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark: —I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder.	12.013506045257452
The lefthand dead shot.	7.4677696732322545
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.	11.70553982444589
—Bottles out there, say.	6.904044724654925
Fifty yards measured.	11.655667197104046
Eggs on the bottles.	24.043192509486502
Aims.	32.172570290454246
He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely.	11.933269339509877
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.	9.837068066017585
—Pom! he then shouted once.	8.756314708940694
The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.	6.7675939858904455
—Pom! he shouted twice.	9.46200307438527
Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily: _—Buffalo Bill shoots to kill, Never missed nor he never will._ A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.	8.15334892355407
—Beg pardon, the sailor said.	6.409987286781662
—Long ago?	15.706852001132006
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.	13.046995220643678
—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years.	12.00870111641129
He toured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus.	10.217219686979009
I seen him do that in Stockholm.	16.7438569259228
—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.	11.692568804685239
—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued.	15.100168403649302
D.	10.724190096818079
Murphy of Carrigaloe.	11.564058977322793
Know where that is?	12.705827986953853
—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.	13.3183052899353
—That’s right, the sailor said.	8.181193635127745
Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle.	8.263072782634653
That’s where I hails from.	10.52831737977176
I belongs there.	4.787992078129222
That’s where I hails from.	10.52831737977176
My little woman’s down there.	7.493094985653796
She’s waiting for me, I know.	12.236307978259772
_For England, home and beauty_.	10.670023740248208
She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailing about.	10.290416445140904
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night with a blind moon.	13.132099387942015
Across the world for a wife.	12.695485707738927
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.	8.451976769041904
Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee.	15.248088696238721
The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections.	10.305766175279835
You little expected me but I’ve come to stay and make a fresh start.	12.496025811768252
There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsame fireside.	14.60721146663347
Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep.	15.763748402573679
And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions.	10.347362826358443
No chair for father.	6.1143888977702785
Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, _post mortem_ child.	8.206401352618437
With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable.	13.245215207559857
Grin and bear it.	3.997343139401449
I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband W.	5.332426061717905
Murphy.	25.535385961793953
The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request: —You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?	14.312126396614197
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.	11.782914975522978
He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers, proceeded: —We come up this morning eleven o’clock.	11.71737721586881
The threemaster _Rosevean_ from Bridgwater with bricks.	6.515491071630652
I shipped to get over.	8.025794033254249
Paid off this afternoon.	10.533641531509335
There’s my discharge.	16.330020749982218
See?	17.705247751504768
D.	10.724190096818079
Murphy.	25.535385961793953
A.	9.56954361575378
In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.	9.645821877039793
—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.	14.925240306709188
—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on.	9.712008494768893
I was in the Red Sea.	16.89172221243673
I was in China and North America and South America.	9.324529692005981
I seen icebergs plenty, growlers.	9.542641810517678
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship.	13.566686969860898
I seen Russia.	18.333933472313284
_Gospodi pomilyou_.	14.509135749322695
That’s how the Russians prays.	13.93101314465795
—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.	11.027898911069888
—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug.	12.199512809948217
I seen queer things too, ups and downs.	11.134348288141112
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.	9.63862237403342
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously: —Khaan! Like that.	8.608470087326426
Look here.	5.577632757716354
Here they are.	6.870247176129313
A friend of mine sent me.	6.410106341680285
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table.	9.181832434803063
The printed matter on it stated: _Choza de Indios.	8.852373087127738
Beni, Bolivia._ All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.	7.307907903015413
—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added.	7.914456116874891
Stomachs like breadgraters.	11.56215161701862
Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.	13.076130786815844
See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.	10.165495428938637
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more.	5.340225641483173
—Know how to keep them off?	15.533466393189695
he inquired generally.	9.155505415128138
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying: —Glass.	8.895531414549366
That boggles ’em.	7.53773378634472
Glass.	25.535385961793953
Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark.	9.126083991340295
It ran as follows: _Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile._ There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.	6.877483143007103
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _Maritana_ on which occasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s _bona fides_ nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London _via_ long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.	9.530384693108576
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through.	10.723610503229871
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.	10.014106006076553
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with.	8.843999767408192
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.	8.150293915846769
Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post you the ticket.	9.303994413236145
No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure.	8.971206424421757
That was the rub.	16.385498723398786
Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times _apropos_ of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the _tapis_ in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally.	11.921528105273264
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co. It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife.	9.024096849461307
After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of _venue_ after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.	8.800418970558674
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the _coup d’œil_ was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar.	8.913744376714
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired.	12.049539532161408
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact.	8.465016956363186
—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different.	10.927613977048871
One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower.	15.07672590601822
Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.	12.900269600951173
Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.	9.223717045133782
—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap.	13.056931114029828
Knife in his back.	8.738199423183296
Knife like that.	4.739693022081733
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position.	8.264724287685903
—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers.	15.164769855435424
Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him.	8.173343284819317
Like that.	4.998933309707568
Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.	16.73400306476666
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to.	6.177807661107072
—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable _stiletto_.	11.030984832876197
After which harrowing _dénouement_ sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.	6.49906944111266
—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all.	11.919563088193147
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.	14.386888819409055
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of _where ignorance is bliss_ Mr B.	7.327295835174236
and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly _entre nous_ variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, _alias_ the keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair.	9.872177934155111
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on.	8.447562402301148
Funny, very! There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause.	7.919325557722601
One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives _choza de_, another the seaman’s discharge.	7.857237807176781
Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood.	14.421295803700836
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.	10.841950250007478
—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in.	9.947587309115418
Give us back them papers.	11.062257151339795
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.	9.316838973816527
—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar?	10.751015621793924
Mr Bloom inquired.	33.456992701371945
The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.	10.032048696518066
—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.	11.688267100042635
—What year would that be about?	14.548326540482027
Mr B interrogated.	13.219605787957882
Can you recall the boats?	14.673570714019608
Our _soi-disant_ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering: —I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.	9.074832432950693
Salt junk all the time.	5.44616114702892
Tired seemingly, he ceased.	14.875719588120463
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves.	10.946849188688589
On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings.	9.208648750282062
And it left him wondering why.	9.325304148937862
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, tempting the fates.	11.962755480151163
Nevertheless, without going into the _minutiae_ of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called _Ireland expects that every man_ and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.	10.009048509427112
—There was a fellow sailed with me in the _Rover_, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s valet at six quid a month.	11.773076468951894
Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife.	15.287121557598905
I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup.	12.754544466621812
I hate roaming about.	9.120387163495163
There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.	12.584458870453872
—What age is he?	12.835601987004154
queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.	9.880783088901905
—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?	14.631703598696015
He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.	9.419147644207452
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.	8.909851621999833
—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts.	13.192311531175882
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day.	9.249521472453772
It’s them black lads I objects to.	6.223885244456384
I hate those buggers.	15.587647974522074
Suck your blood dry, they does.	8.02293721741051
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.	13.744397375932401
—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained.	14.281695783692212
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton.	12.502557889583626
There he is himself, a Greek.	19.156958694501885
—Did it hurt much doing it?	7.219000403254621
one asked the sailor.	10.389593693709363
That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.	6.971170956190804
Someway in his.	7.654337005991497
Squeezing or.	10.743242539620338
—See here, he said, showing Antonio.	14.878639655140848
There he is cursing the mate.	14.045237213713628
And there he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.	14.593138317272917
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.	8.367466239977313
—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest.	10.095367328770287
He’s gone too.	10.897597139335712
Ate by sharks after.	6.028740708086767
Ay, ay.	14.924286486931594
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.	9.647438583424126
—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.	7.63230452464587
—And what’s the number for?	13.540252316837874
loafer number two queried.	8.374988284702924
—Eaten alive?	11.919992587633969
a third asked the sailor.	11.069108224419372
—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number.	12.97592758996588
Ate.	32.172570290454246
A Greek he was.	5.434323938341845
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end: —As bad as old Antonio, For he left me on my ownio.	10.183223548151615
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill.	12.35435806044376
Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink.	13.318083053671058
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance of his washing.	11.765227450151441
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.	8.748534644697953
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt.	10.584787295987525
Still just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off.	12.06723648699699
Round the side of the _Evening Telegraph_ he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.	10.06961082965571
—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least.	10.90824146145788
Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.	10.516575086591232
Still no matter what the cause is from...	5.265077797480181
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking: —In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade.	9.523568251821775
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul.	7.6328814268943646
She is a bad merchant.	19.83038976789024
She buys dear and sells cheap.	7.344531439986241
The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _instanter_ to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfully state, he, as a _paterfamilias_, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start.	11.887000360412866
Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.	9.164649646462639
—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul.	13.558685504367649
Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup.	11.985978829821896
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter.	14.46749662046581
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance.	8.206571961628592
Do you?	10.347183456435195
Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say: —They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible.	11.94884431776931
It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, _corruptio per se_ and _corruptio per accidens_ both being excluded by court etiquette.	9.893373110863926
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining: —Simple?	12.556041622209705
I shouldn’t think that is the proper word.	12.762019608743167
Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.	12.099574882988996
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.	12.212908602920209
—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.	10.681826269357366
On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.	9.58134315046599
—Has been?	16.176744755988565
the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief.	12.870087530466767
I’m not so sure about that.	9.121640398310852
That’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you _in toto_ there.	13.166005946140597
My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like _Hamlet_ and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.	9.135054467722167
Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way?	12.90422557029487
Let me stir it.	6.561981045047158
And take a piece of that bun.	19.546381370704122
It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised.	19.930173597866506
Still no-one can give what he hasn’t got.	14.521518609004888
Try a bit.	7.923923180085093
—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.	12.995054258870518
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work.	9.469996875911908
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders.	7.82361434496043
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying.	12.305011245965462
The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of.	9.642372145202083
Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when it was or where.	10.247890809345906
Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.	10.359599534178551
—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.	13.862093256772956
—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _sine qua non_ for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.	10.239565183705585
You ought to eat more solid food.	10.466570072521481
You would feel a different man.	8.012335183683147
—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said.	5.601029586077895
But O, oblige me by taking away that knife.	10.38308610867163
I can’t look at the point of it.	9.897785112965611
It reminds me of Roman history.	9.495881573129033
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.	8.651593628883493
—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom _apropos_ of knives remarked to his _confidante sotto voce_.	12.565115544343438
Do you think they are genuine?	26.90603254179163
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots.	7.835012608756756
Look at him.	5.835273295247057
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.	11.056529723528316
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him.	10.798102624977814
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity.	8.615103810966296
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described.	9.99039937678988
On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner _Hesperus_ and etcetera.	8.572317606735686
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.	8.00678183907748
—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.	12.686742926544062
Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with.	7.115680538505264
Giants, though that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen.	10.63872796361549
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods.	10.581426594939545
There’s an example again of simple souls.	9.693848623930778
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, _alias_ Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _Flying Dutchman_, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded.	10.099356136250703
—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen.	10.232519843560025
It comes from the great heat, climate generally.	12.312905622547584
My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is.	7.460318633563569
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar.	8.726500590263575
She has the Spanish type.	14.30025370844086
Quite dark, regular brunette, black.	7.385810958742668
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character.	6.741617904800093
That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.	14.92824249093533
—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings.	12.579190864198013
_Roberto ruba roba sua_.	8.512345240026935
—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.	17.611159892253546
—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.	8.574052785188993
—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once.	10.739597641328974
All are washed in the blood of the sun.	10.837991299883402
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there.	10.281221203727505
The splendid proportions of hips, bosom.	6.533627428033127
You simply don’t knock against those kind of women here.	9.299951705865956
An exception here and there.	4.830735978425394
Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is the female form.	13.442561985747215
Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say.	10.275818403449875
Rumpled stockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply hate to see.	9.886914446250469
Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing.	9.459768569155159
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say.	11.000528711767691
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.	11.048767506452046
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _Palme_ on Booterstown strand.	10.871884813212318
That was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _Times_), breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror.	10.265386728452143
Then someone said something about the case of the s.	7.294585614680923
s.	7.595351801251561
_Lady Cairns_ of Swansea run into by the _Mona_ which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck.	8.814902161769286
No aid was given.	10.446786059652082
Her master, the _Mona_’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way.	10.2358740766005
She had no water, it appears, in her hold.	18.93313544713302
At this stage an incident happened.	9.141745495522125
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.	7.898652664142275
—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze.	11.698259289067007
He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left.	11.75805397906241
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise.	11.930172765754437
The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved.	10.70393670047358
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank.	10.879167884070082
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled.	6.192120571975775
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of.	9.070409697428016
And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.	11.03769053701102
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if, however—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.	12.49607387637972
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing.	7.915513980081717
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launch that year.	8.613600324216874
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.	6.511247193101276
There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently _au fait_.	12.339285942803311
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh?	8.433591295544884
Ask the then captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.	13.046703567957518
—Am I right, skipper?	13.701559467043097
he queried of the sailor, now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.	15.515363199705329
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds.	10.726295699979708
Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question.	11.375797746562668
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-_cum_-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the _soirée_, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook: —The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.	9.683745356623
O, Johnny Lever! Johnny Lever, O! After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.	9.24174950758238
Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein.	10.36871256365224
You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navan growing tobacco.	11.462325431510706
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon?	12.898487430933258
But a day of reckoning, he stated _crescendo_ with no uncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes.	10.61850702489387
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.	14.148596478149802
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed.	13.586437777079446
The Boers were the beginning of the end.	10.195881002148253
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot.	11.421519931204578
His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland.	9.81599574900465
Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.	14.961049489576496
Silence all round marked the termination of his _finale_.	14.387455589626606
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.	6.161983502810074
—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.	9.307318265195702
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.	9.73725182144761
—Who’s the best troops in the army?	19.576334000144442
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated.	6.59327324610994
And the best jumpers and racers?	18.24143780243395
And the best admirals and generals we’ve got?	16.18672864819203
Tell me that.	6.167465676953594
—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.	8.310836497268639
—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated.	14.544300717571607
The Irish catholic peasant.	12.073902007594361
He’s the backbone of our empire.	13.558640782688567
You know Jem Mullins?	16.980074507286773
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it.	7.509641948891666
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	10.659186056686451
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.	9.375791491953253
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.	12.454200717603594
And now, why?	16.863887210489548
So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, the others seeing least of the game.	13.186669579616305
And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated.	11.350279664183892
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle.	8.426700229287277
Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _liaison_ by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on.	10.462460264060624
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome.	11.395738591939743
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high.	10.278234543466922
Like actresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again.	5.608373734602461
Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow.	13.372890515102412
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £.	10.347802908365
s.	7.595351801251561
d.	16.81846716713923
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the _Old Ireland_ tavern, come back to Erin and so on.	13.415648388256352
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.	13.312144175935977
—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip.	14.209109222018252
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively.	14.651127835637736
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I’m not.	12.1220313164215
That was one for him.	8.217529353989084
A soft answer turns away wrath.	9.001281481258614
He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw.	9.252349368464463
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.	11.354202318208788
—Of course, Mr B.	13.235944645163594
proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question.	12.314471890627958
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves.	9.960513535466724
But with a little goodwill all round.	13.803965598969835
It’s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.	9.418646718597623
It never reaches anything or stops anything.	6.825931236892371
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan.	11.419407304437527
It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, in the next house so to speak.	10.641873143068064
—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.	8.436975137412288
Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right.	8.705974026131559
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.	14.582813855426236
—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said.	10.62114056875608
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...	4.417390676794721
All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.	8.89418406988954
—They accuse, remarked he audibly.	9.785150547572782
He turned away from the others, who probably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they… —Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of ruining.	11.918802038780715
Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say.	9.507004115464138
History, would you be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them.	7.761038645106721
Why?	12.512270304170855
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit.	16.702677906925164
They are practical and are proved to be so.	9.084554632065426
But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest spells poverty.	11.656272358252556
Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America.	12.860376699213951
Turks.	32.172570290454246
It’s in the dogma.	19.41371046787041
Because if they didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least so I think.	12.996611913996322
That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raise the wind on false pretences.	11.312337558443861
I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes _pro rata_ having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum.	9.716893732291888
That’s the vital issue at stake and it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man.	8.705462062317551
At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth.	14.074155073584082
I call that patriotism.	15.392630288402533
_Ubi patria_, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in _Alma Mater, vita bene_.	7.380874949953699
Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.	14.527421571696465
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.	11.304367893513884
He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to.	9.52854947349344
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.	12.959203265734317
—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.	8.69598202806994
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who owned them pro tem.	10.659783713061088
observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, have to, together.	9.865521375986381
—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense.	12.132458037991691
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.	9.154129615807953
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays.	14.121969208392544
Important work.	7.948388622588742
After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price.	10.850243698878371
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has.	12.280443307060683
You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.	15.142962457447883
Each is equally important.	10.10335112614493
—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the _faubourg Saint Patrice_ called Ireland for short.	13.7629810209258
—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.	17.19232835607503
—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.	11.071975155898645
—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension.	11.637761476917156
Excuse me.	4.599893071517553
Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latter portion.	17.044629916281355
What was it you...?	7.9111854196186195
Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding: —We can’t change the country.	9.106543943290186
Let us change the subject.	11.58192828838358
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry.	10.864781148042264
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state.	11.64369922195452
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people.	10.689193873611176
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves.	10.142031567659123
For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact).	8.611968871573838
And then the usual _dénouement_ after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains.	10.0926306038745
Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it.	10.736781700324075
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.	9.598592636602337
However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps.	17.10380694023714
Sheer force of natural genius, that.	4.609061203337779
With brains, sir.	4.8467131477341665
For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himself in for it.	9.610968814293482
Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.	5.666523674021524
Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.	10.346186857437424
Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.	10.016026951082273
coalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately.	9.317312590332772
To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column.	10.0897544967026

Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turned out the poor fool hadn’t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope.	11.993811994477554
Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.	8.62044117647656
—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.	7.583176478909173
—Who?	11.362660442813608
the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.	6.832236498595875
One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: _Return of Parnell_.	11.76384909628052
He bet them what they liked.	12.307451990138516
Pride it was killed him.	8.58295446829476
He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him.	10.402603525963315
Dead he wasn’t.	5.660934891091456
Simply absconded somewhere.	6.1929645013612165
The coffin they brought over was full of stones.	8.499580002329228
He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general.	11.008870402825792
He made a mistake to fight the priests.	10.211688806616518
And so forth and so on.	6.475132246805264
All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.	11.717865757342324
Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.	12.942916607815892
Something evidently riled them in his death.	9.695805270237829
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands.	7.99111885825423
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the _Alice, where art thou_ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility.	9.573546450061986
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between.	10.767982618211018
It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, and then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.	11.639773900629185
And the identical same with murderers.	13.094322228567131
You had to come back.	10.720151830761935
That haunting sense kind of drew you.	6.405491895105155
To show the understudy in the title _rôle_ how to.	7.955820038054612
He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the _Insuppressible_ or was it _United Ireland_, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said _Thank you_, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone.	12.32580543155922
Still as regards return.	7.467528372051119
You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back.	9.109669950234968
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against.	7.853288848979858
And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne, _Bella_ was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with: _Excuse me, my name is So and So_ or some such commonplace remark.	11.65584503348645
A more prudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.	9.968764999478859
She put the first nail in his coffin.	17.201504437665015
—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the _soi-disant_ townclerk Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her.	9.894165109091565
I seen her picture in a barber’s.	9.099833452297025
The husband was a captain or an officer.	13.78442016600666
This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his _entourage_.	10.137852990202857
As regards Bloom he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings.	12.053274599190738
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into.	10.185950670934844
Since their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of.	10.281146944088489
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles.	12.173961205870286
The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up.	6.915937907605319
Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?	10.452198614787113
Poser.	32.172570290454246
Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection, carried away by a wave of folly.	10.846279185614863
A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday _farewell, my gallant captain_ kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.	11.346846048865672
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream.	12.142335153899355
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times.	12.438002204775856
Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side.	12.92802380519766
North or south, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.	9.393974898885853
—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to Stephen, about blood and the sun.	12.0693045973485
And, if I don’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too.	12.41887629557759
—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.	10.353828976512165
—Was she?	11.652235632157748
Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means, I never heard that rumour before.	9.123086417551393
Possible, especially there, it was as she lived there.	10.241886711053796
So, Spain.	13.606852265199432
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket _Sweets of_, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he.	11.459697961911814
—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?	11.625820385995883
Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was _In Old Madrid_, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue.	11.621339885416528
Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.	12.290680232658817
—Mrs Bloom, my wife the _prima donna_ Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated.	10.115245608502097
In or about ninety six.	7.21430388523024
Very like her then.	7.531777117241409
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen.	10.712594148251096
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup.	14.121219833670962
She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the.	8.666934879895935
He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum.	11.829701830657527
Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry, all the rest.	9.974471997393625
Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint Joseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop.	11.607374965057764
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.	11.420081182248634
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to.	10.537129947769548
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so.	10.725266817728198
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.	11.438255013237882
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.	11.536923727237939
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving _embonpoint_.	7.792189438464501
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out.	8.741247861079973
Suppose she was gone when he?	15.791699705245055
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (_sic_) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.	10.647311318058414
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, _distingué_ and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would.	9.81668111714198
And why not?	10.544816260934681
An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business.	9.193522146764534
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate.	8.560110210497315
Then the decree _nisi_ and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, _nisi_ was made absolute.	13.062021326145246
But as for that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course.	10.310906727456548
He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _fracas_ when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _Insuppressible_ or no it was _United Ireland_ (a by no means by the by appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals.	12.48287124414875
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive.	8.417469529005848
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character.	11.766377046176904
His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _aplomb_, saying: _Thank you, sir_, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.	11.901898392999934
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others.	10.609723305827336
He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many _liaisons_ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.	9.527626606860961
It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime.	9.909744496867456
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a _conditio sine qua non_ though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs.	9.999636294844128
To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age.	9.860224874112758
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.	9.288140248854102
—At what o’clock did you dine?	12.706700461607957
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.	7.493606852665209
—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.	4.624287368591398
—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday.	10.380724231980047
Ah, you mean it’s after twelve! —The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.	11.100834736404272
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.	10.150476302295846
Though they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought.	8.830358549915575
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a _quasi_ aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.	8.27886468323453
For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.	9.210504822969499
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night.	10.391861792614229
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak.	9.68617652745172
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives.	15.138745878362542
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.	14.496972859048679
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway.	11.472558462178577
For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable.	12.520678986023333
At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.	10.19276857061115
A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks _passim_.	9.654116383369205
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.	11.767229806103071
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep.	13.22837825798822
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles.	8.419797503370411
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.	10.211811185289935
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity.	12.473590435571081
You can’t drink that stuff.	11.90786627086897
Do you like cocoa?	30.135174983368742
I’ll just pay this lot.	11.313419150260936
The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty who didn’t seem to.	9.67825773352124
—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.	10.589088569514711
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain, education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a slice of luck.	8.874968510466887
An opening was all was wanted.	9.931917844005953
Because he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.	12.188246769926348
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in London somewhere.	10.324034728461864
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.	12.903386165308362
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary’s lodge or words to that effect.	11.832380283006986
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.	7.854406922606639
—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.	10.047408539186854
—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.	8.414877154562399
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.	11.763985036308755
—Are you bad in the eyes?	19.178442678732388
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried.	10.105418499357416
—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.	12.975056078514887
Sand in the Red Sea done that.	8.655239015237662
One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking.	13.621824159844241
_The Arabian Nights Entertainment_ was my favourite and _Red as a Rose is She._ Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.	7.287008176860582
To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.	9.995151827988831
—Come, he counselled to close the _séance_.	11.331320016926455
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the _élite_ society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their _dolce far niente_.	9.923326912211955
Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment, the door.	9.041089387494825
—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the moment.	15.156050079853172
Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, on the tables in cafés.	12.192929723805218
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off: —To sweep the floor in the morning.	9.98469652479137
So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles.	12.259534607836756
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.	11.578771995216586
—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment.	13.227486007600765
The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.	10.891643521108072
It’s not far.	15.513505478559589
Lean on me.	4.63155599025246
—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.	11.68398517408053
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc.	7.602402447957119
And _apropos_ of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.	9.29241677895154
So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place.	11.322182917739806
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or _Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be_.	9.361255478525804
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s _Stabat Mater_, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or _virtuosi_ rather.	11.147151101004054
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore.	12.484233625825663
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the _Don Giovanni_ description and _Martha_, a gem in its line, he had a _penchant_, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn.	11.300497697475988
And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned _par excellence_ Lionel’s air in _Martha, M’appari_, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat.	12.421339751206142
Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who _anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus_, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom B.	9.54497193420408
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _dux_ and _comes_ conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.	8.15014702639393
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.	9.47994108991709
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.	10.846203382746118
Beware of the steamroller.	29.930988906695656
They thereupon stopped.	6.809235227756041
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts.	11.869491488729231
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up.	10.305232299300823
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world.	12.589087063820786
But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face.	9.786291616528151
But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump.	14.196941931086284
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees.	8.955262829221954
Whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye.	7.562310481842553
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.	10.35105044065036
—What’s this I was saying?	17.887341061084985
Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging _in medias res_, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.	9.619747705457687
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.	13.813612324491771
Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.	14.269282391591528
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air _Youth here has End_ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.	7.402137935062277
Even more he liked an old German song of _Johannes Jeep_ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit: Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten.	7.773739781332624
These opening bars he sang and translated _extempore_.	7.610301447326633
Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.	12.68654830174827
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _entrée_ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B.	8.54972030578235
A.	9.56954361575378
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic _conversaziones_ during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have.	11.928361417155738
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees.	12.04362438671971
Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time.	8.664161180966484
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.	10.297166548684892
Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their _genus omne_.	9.007691802045661
Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big _if_, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows.	12.155397258919253
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone.	10.49898949446224
In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.	10.560518234598696
The horse was just then.	9.266452391192791
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the _fools step in where angels_ principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended.	11.013988508699716
The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds.	8.505349754120443
Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired.	11.03365556353932
And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.	9.508152057997847
Side by side Bloom, profiting by the _contretemps_, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.	12.602195633513977
Und alle Schiffe brücken.	8.809523962468996
The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, _to be married by Father Maher_.	10.942254180859837
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _tête à tête_ (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies of man’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _and looked after their lowbacked car_.	10.482711781896274
[ 17 ] What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?	11.10025157817454
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place.	8.749172697153833
Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.	9.21156893818914
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?	9.955125219160923
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.	10.289938264505427
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?	7.022616816923179
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plastic or pictorial.	5.49906274312869
Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence.	10.704977276551658
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines.	4.850665715998671
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.	5.706965788292212
Were their views on some points divergent?	11.83463362791959
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature.	11.337937690256126
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand.	7.285010281789203
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?	9.897401603821866
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.	8.388355659173877
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?	10.886534965877631
In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.	8.550464712215984
In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.	8.876707547464468
In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines.	7.476935728206286
In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.	10.518018152699607
Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.	11.206904353906848
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.	8.561831111608523
As in what ways?	11.753814270409075
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.	8.874494713445154
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?	13.874729641787305
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.	13.228676721954598
Was it there?	14.62458874779267
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.	18.60279997491943
Why was he doubly irritated?	16.879661314389253
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?	8.525094135558886
To enter or not to enter.	14.145837610362717
To knock or not to knock.	12.284193650619589
Bloom’s decision?	34.54086431862189
A stratagem.	14.509135749322695
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.	9.700930201061235
Did he fall?	22.51607757169349
By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.	10.15907788956864
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?	11.623851585964832
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.	8.23560282203599
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?	7.693733449898314
Did the man reappear elsewhere?	20.135192869009483
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.	9.080014379972605
The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges.	9.58372250835845
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.	17.90013353439294
Did Stephen obey his sign?	10.892762042683081
What did Bloom do?	14.47453698723445
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.	7.905438687930499
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?	10.232717111939671
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’ theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.	11.185112140001348
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?	19.49205963263681
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.	7.694283588459365
What did Bloom see on the range?	23.260831968992285
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.	9.387383620550006
What did Bloom do at the range?	20.771886530920963
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.	8.512495779908916
Did it flow?	19.788140965113712
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.	7.856702784122752
E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.	9.906557585951933
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?	9.124704868398462
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine % marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.	6.531021640208315
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?	11.37605816501389
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.	8.737658979805618
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?	12.132726424542836
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.	7.644127587541637
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?	7.844343054995493
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.	7.716866625377993
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?	10.872826054175288
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.	11.965518970736698
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?	14.06991589309158
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.	9.365572017893733
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?	12.744849099393125
The phenomenon of ebullition.	9.047303310599755
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether.	6.703234537365141
Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.	10.303779776232284
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?	9.979350083982922
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.	8.709647893845213
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?	8.793351186024873
To shave himself.	5.659064424455286
What advantages attended shaving by night?	9.425653079221679
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.	7.738545576948311
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?	12.654789479386375
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.	11.423407329983089
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?	11.344929290636351
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.	8.40518009050141
What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?	9.54278378426475
On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree’s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co’s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps’s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch’s choice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one, the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy’s cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom’s and Mrs Fleming’s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak.	9.545304218526368
On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.	8.365495785790358
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?	17.698795148929875
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 8 87, 88 6.	5.367309997586869
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?	10.862460920499517
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the _Evening Telegraph_, late pink edition, in the cabman’s shelter, at Butt bridge.	10.453996590937168
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?	7.219733040358856
In Bernard Kiernan’s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street: in David Byrne’s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O’Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon’s when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F.	9.754113044552806
W.	10.471761903420298
Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M.	8.140424627541544
(Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the _Freeman’s Journal_ and _National Press_ which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.	10.581225002401718
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?	8.092325063727614
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.	7.116766616235873
His mood?	18.54934014630527
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.	17.86937343408751
What satisfied him?	7.561877067324716
To have sustained no positive loss.	8.129153522776692
To have brought a positive gain to others.	7.084234749172269
Light to the gentiles.	24.27356676278995
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?	17.579494972825636
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps’s soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.	9.835633773581499
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?	9.055627254233936
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).	10.151257222079236
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?	11.693664755339954
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps’s massproduct, the creature cocoa.	11.368531840282085
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?	8.923148138704526
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest’s jacket.	18.966603657333053
A gift to his guest of one of the four lady’s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.	13.096213254201263
Who drank more quickly?	13.445186855614908
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent’s one, six to two, nine to three.	10.425418866436234
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?	8.074462353991525
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.	7.9278203782342285
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing in all points.	10.65785763532098
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the _Shamrock_, a weekly newspaper?	12.68979277636837
An ambition to squint At my verses in print Makes me hope that for these you’ll find room.	8.008831975382302
If you so condescend Then please place at the end The name of yours truly, L.	9.468628420763851
Bloom.	7.595351801251561
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?	8.715334301641997
Name, age, race, creed.	9.324931971134632
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?	15.292473878287849
Leopold Bloom Ellpodbomool Molldopeloob Bollopedoom Old Ollebo, M.	5.32482241215945
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?	10.835739389161335
Poets oft have sung in rhyme Of music sweet their praise divine.	5.97605130414085
Let them hymn it nine times nine.	7.04042878324855
The world is mine.	9.468864651598222
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R.	6.411866338170982
G.	16.81846716713923
Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years, entitled _If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now_, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime _Sinbad the Sailor_ (produced by R.	9.263192462540706
Shelton 26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A.	6.176362810059299
Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal girl?	6.099466827684398
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the duke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist’s non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist’s revelations of white articles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from _Everybody’s Book of Jokes_ (1000 pages and a laugh in every one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.	8.354968385033743
What relation existed between their ages?	12.609405296230289
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen’s present age Stephen was 6.	10.88849075712158
16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom’s present age Bloom would be 54.	10.087746209949378
In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C. What events might nullify these calculations?	11.51272918227517
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.	10.763457890505405
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?	9.082451441955751
Two.	20.267449269082853
The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon’s house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation.	11.607505561814483
The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.	15.190466965836919
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?	9.81628222508066
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.	10.982899596490178
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?	9.578224187214072
Mrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts of the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.	11.326802195914459
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?	8.600303027024797
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and _vice versa_.	7.8059113881194735
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?	13.157459466850584
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.	7.707672053830148
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?	9.493232440901538
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.	8.62485261798275
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?	9.113674318191604
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s _Physical Strength and How to Obtain It_ which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.	7.471090314301044
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?	8.114429699215552
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.	10.854895985363015
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?	8.854838789849165
Neither.	32.172570290454246
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen?	13.237386363020267
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.	14.076180022618118
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?	11.632675938199492
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty).	7.4882205971345455
Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).	7.365971007625035
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?	10.306301046524984
Bloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M.	10.150717295419003
A., alone, in the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C.	9.335665930734299
C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	11.773395279704907
Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone C.	7.115884544700735
C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.	11.980130162535119
Did they find their educational careers similar?	8.94948354126371
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school.	12.268935814270243
Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.	8.995954474703042
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?	11.981253270728415
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.	10.247020219638083
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	10.16676854767827
The scientific.	14.833002552262101
The artistic.	15.088141794024638
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?	8.454439585364
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.	10.291816596973437
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?	8.159684599964482
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults.	7.076038698207945
They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.	4.576962884888025
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?	15.896541386322331
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.	4.745506284323634
James, the former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George’s street, south, the latter at his 6 1/2d shop and world’s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.	10.035557071734091

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?	7.818173555371055
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.	9.119716068182266

Queen’s Ho...	5.9356130602060455
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?	7.660952268698636
The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.	10.939482000976813
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?	7.396663191337762
Coincidence.	22.307214335724723
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?	12.337666431481058
He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.	10.25203129838088
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as _A Pisgah Sight of Palestine_ or _The Parable of the Plums_?	12.610939869458615
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. _My Favourite Hero_ or _Procrastination is the Thief of Time_) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s _Studies in Blue_, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S.	6.177613122766368
Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m. Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?	9.818132548220351
What to do with our wives.	13.946858626504381
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?	10.604858185284291
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.	5.170921813705747
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?	11.786325426150055
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters.	8.143651231204014
She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec.	8.853607980261566
She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external.	6.967003822585321
In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.	5.289930408694072
After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall.	6.525421649925352
Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), _alias_ (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).	6.554301615004432
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?	9.15929312192483
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction.	9.024284139217391
The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.	7.801077716735474
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?	8.725085475296108
Variously.	32.172570290454246
By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s ignorant lapse.	10.957088250119526
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?	11.90395386089617
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.	8.994732646892384
What system had proved more effective?	8.932958127830231
Example?	32.172570290454246
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.	11.568178445561742
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?	12.106811334435585
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of _More Nebukim_ (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).	7.67986574322576
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?	9.281303094609866
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.	10.83141117277107
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?	10.675864230200428
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).	6.017197225088624
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?	8.117866165229408
By Stephen: _suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin_ (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).	5.9827164938361
By Bloom: _Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m’baad l’zamatejch_ (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).	5.97171519527068
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?	14.480266593668984
By juxtaposition.	14.509135749322695
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entituled _Sweets of Sin_ (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.	7.480140165225029
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?	12.334803579814215
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.	6.304287404306464
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?	7.387971165974761
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.	5.464230990378544
Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.	9.60688037689221
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation?	8.657379679352617
Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.	5.356983155412744
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.	10.384870466507262
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?	11.741667397532806
By a periphrastic version of the general text.	13.504883489867158
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?	8.92115647884549
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).	7.962415555953739
Did the guest comply with his host’s request?	24.605261702132612
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.	9.506038379842181
What was Stephen’s auditive sensation?	19.914432593603774
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.	9.137455033713758
What was Bloom’s visual sensation?	21.064669244934418
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.	11.338265838802446
What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?	10.632251461907645
Visually, Stephen’s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.	4.8366373108971485
Auditively, Bloom’s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.	10.68015733963021
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?	14.337918978354109
J., the reverend T.	12.836515653985222
Salmon, D.	6.015701060164635
D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J.	7.273141590411295
Dowie.	32.172570290454246
At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.	6.263040262926451
C., Rufus Isaacs, K.	7.9968079147044095
C.	8.56499542248637
On the stage, modern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle († 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.	6.106254700596461
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?	10.622549801474209
Reassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.	8.6633382763045
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.	10.782309984590587
Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.	10.415697260674705
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it o’er the jew’s garden wall.	9.313097384520447
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew’s windows all.	9.400245906746111
[Illustration] How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?	9.96719077563148
With unmixed feeling.	7.3308638820082805
Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.	11.262136924171715
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.	14.26406325269472
Then out there came the jew’s daughter And she all dressed in green.	10.94625439630696
“Come back, come back, you pretty little boy, And play your ball again.” I can’t come back and I won’t come back Without my schoolfellows all.	10.546683776570752
For if my master he did hear He’d make it a sorry ball.” She took him by the lilywhite hand And led him along the hall Until she led him to a room Where none could hear him call.	10.449962411813688
She took a penknife out of her pocket And cut off his little head.	10.763674529053695
[Illustration] How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?	8.956706997827702
Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s daughter, all dressed in green.	12.031837989012653
Condense Stephen’s commentary.	22.223614372191204
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined.	15.946146305987691
Once by inadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny.	6.67539473895852
It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting.	9.504434206441122
It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.	11.569294298564373
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?	10.912415772430302
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.	14.575726522375051
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?	10.840873082063538
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.	13.827541988001967
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?	11.012380924749836
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.	9.378898447057475
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?	10.293372889413122
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds.	7.442890001340915
From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.	8.507929954962181
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?	11.597310674876784
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.	11.12988069689636
What other infantile memories had he of her?	8.71104294955539
15 June 1889.	5.909724185464518
A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion.	6.295622125521933
A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.	7.398443315866932
What endemic characteristics were present?	9.378594042600893
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.	8.38654141726115
What memories had he of her adolescence?	15.14724472792602
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess.	8.789942291795981
On the duke’s lawn, entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated).	8.56659565559244
On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated).	9.075268627820241
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?	7.0846477641561005
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.	17.954174258219567
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly, if differently?	10.581399611958851
A temporary departure of his cat.	11.180591093532541
Why similarly, why differently?	11.17276800195507
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian).	8.897169654143056
Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.	14.55458480039706
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.	12.154306331773459
As?	22.307214335724716
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf neckarching cat).	6.759098506722355
Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf mousewatching cat).	7.29436021445287
Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf earwashing cat).	7.592484139581539
Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf hearthdreaming cat).	9.452153475760372
Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.	12.583690238839083
In what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?	9.727512591182661
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of clockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, _videlicet_, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.	8.972089584881855
In what manners did she reciprocate?	14.392374117325025
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.	8.92361009086506
She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires.	9.178529981965344
She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.	11.454819257702539
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?	9.503310707181848
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.	9.267383748691445
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such an extemporisation?	10.686736912562642
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study.	7.824060645307026
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter?	8.786587776006304
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.	11.304426598005508
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.	7.71373792906639
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?	10.659827441497685
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?	11.071350061025013
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.	11.026627909542096
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?	10.09509590764201
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to the former.	14.557397476122519
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?	4.761593072535417
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed.	9.453588236899739
To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress.	9.361212255577335
To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the _Ship_ hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W.	7.393143315792581
and E.	6.348468875699751
Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places, fuck everyone who is reading this shit).	9.720327216443792
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?	7.094947428118525
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa.	11.321363785160266
The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J.	10.781555365755011
and T.	6.733809943501398
Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.	8.398772077879835
Was the clown Bloom’s son?	16.49812500633383
No. Had Bloom’s coin returned?	21.62403227064864
Never.	25.535385961793953
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?	6.286033843759523
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.	8.09153827572755
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?	7.102865121705443
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.	7.085358172612402
Why did he desist from speculation?	13.991331502339813
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.	12.24757469737386
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?	17.226258904018284
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.	10.72283371312395
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?	6.91258857356678
Not verbally.	14.949365283168918
Substantially.	32.172570290454246
What comforted his misapprehension?	10.333290124897292
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.	16.588689663831833
In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?	12.062664693662585
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by BLOOM Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by STEPHEN With what intonation _secreto_ of what commemorative psalm?	6.346569674205043
The 113th, _modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro_.	5.108979235251285
What did each do at the door of egress?	16.006460057458256
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor.	9.217610177169021
Stephen put the hat on his head.	9.625480095348264
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?	13.079387602345264
For a cat.	12.036373605737808
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?	12.020493627491016
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.	6.213028653614596
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?	11.520405350572808
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.	8.20860325757955
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?	7.8661308090880455
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.	7.271582106782165
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?	12.477865114776577
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.	9.75370424800884
Of a different order of difficulty.	12.839511804287646
Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.	7.04029318850306
And the problem of possible redemption?	18.377493163898635
The minor was proved by the major.	12.47781965481584
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?	16.981167269978346
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner’s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S.	6.758380393711821
Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.	8.917900527379512
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman.	12.514983353207818
That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence.	9.332770878603116
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?	22.7201260135551
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.	11.795389279059833
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?	7.956211315445198
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?	12.636998589527748
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.	9.508022651040195
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?	9.8040711252467
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.	8.019201056652227
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?	12.030906688894676
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.	7.000126662147095
Both then were silent?	10.471351453139429
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.	10.750125888607599
Were they indefinitely inactive?	10.291703858230296
At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.	10.029118027750904
Similarly?	32.172570290454246
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.	10.394939663507854
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?	8.761912159520856
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.	5.689142115888677
To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.	9.337832882711389
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?	10.12299061116667
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.	9.42329345981558
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?	11.164097037748554
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.	7.731995481641417
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?	15.915984375457016
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.	12.121627795636028
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?	9.096216835228882
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?	9.346333702518985
By Stephen: Liliata rutilantium.	9.954637995302592
Turma circumdet.	12.378863073457003
Iubilantium te virginum.	9.074654932062453
Chorus excipiat.	14.509135749322695
By Bloom: Heigho, heigho, Heigho, heigho.	6.592962464442925
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?	13.17221611450372
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).	10.835999846925333
Alone, what did Bloom hear?	18.114512088510626
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew’s harp in the resonant lane.	13.13414111234251
Alone, what did Bloom feel?	20.949850855173295
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.	6.122838682138759
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?	5.9769232516043305
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F.	6.79986745848469
Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).	7.21114595280844
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?	13.173971626115893
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparition of a new solar disk.	12.283203668435762
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?	15.70269012448768
Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.	12.350698252905161
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?	9.85115040173807
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.	11.83717941918444
Did he remain?	19.448402427877237
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door.	4.324781973928229
With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.	7.182718688744963
What suddenly arrested his ingress?	9.10429766515536
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.	10.693115398986903
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furniture.	14.095934477165775
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.	9.876064811002372
Describe them.	4.858053960907274
One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.	8.329307557439474
The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.	7.955802841786007
What significances attached to these two chairs?	9.676364454304665
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.	11.352985143010265
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?	12.249298740968475
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of _Love’s Old Sweet Song_ (words by G.	7.533986907013163

Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications _ad libitum, forte_, pedal, _animato_, sustained pedal, _ritirando_, close.	6.7262808550150455
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?	9.908228538197964
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.	6.710635018077804
His next proceeding?	13.884117579040701
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.	9.50335568934511
What followed this operation?	12.734368732781139
The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.	6.2745873028100165
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?	11.77618077748021
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.	7.58289007642273
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?	7.052302520384355
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.	13.526924961766152
Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.	6.336575576455055
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?	10.730946823596161
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.	6.70682823925904
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?	8.455883279296971
Brothers and sisters had he none.	10.427049713013766
Yet that man’s father was his grandfather’s son.	12.544991826707909
Why mutable (aliorelative)?	8.186228839215213
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.	9.47831483430505
From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal procreator.	8.025534039432804
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?	12.653197045565571
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.	9.810632473634502

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?	12.269178762351501
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.	11.013637199757396

Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?	10.780712135149297
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when, seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.	10.135168942137238
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?	10.815911545202878

How was the irritation allayed?	18.19783366895668
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table.	10.827342578586151
He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences.	8.122454175132349

He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.	11.460683266610538

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the lacerated ungual fragment.	9.313054679029714
Why with satisfaction?	15.765260301760183

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?	15.489224220024877
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality, of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown.	7.002874414483968
Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.	7.70912578773529
Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.	15.163822852298372
To Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888.	10.280808604875029
To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in _The Descent of Man_ and _The Origin of Species_.	7.110563510238971
In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J.	8.001829551482778

An old man, widower, unkempt of hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian, suicide by poison.	8.35201717365762
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?	11.775707257107367
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.	8.112543473060656
As?	22.307214335724716
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?	9.339386480551784

What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?	8.702662225326568
Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.	10.132886946620994
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?	7.162588778326215
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.	10.367863449123375
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat.	8.421812408785867

The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.	16.122272948441072
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.	7.975940812837671

Destitution: the inmate of Old Man’s House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson’s Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight.	9.56688560551046
Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.	7.4628874018688265
With which attendant indignities?	11.00211376956532
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less than nothing.	7.665847142462149
By what could such a situation be precluded?	14.355720518051845

The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if not disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.	7.949421460373217
What considerations rendered departure desirable?	9.423233202180954

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?	8.660426548666367
Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall.	5.625637429022841
Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.	9.005862410616766
What would render such return irrational?	9.619889831205176

Bloom’s acts?	33.4394461458085
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.	8.93291548605247
How?	17.705247751504768
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.	8.972528075648178
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?	10.60859347312502
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.	9.369738283806628
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?	16.08995814590053
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.	10.876470321275765
What preceding series?	15.429351472008994
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d’Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society’s Horse Show, Maggot O’Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E.	8.860067024640314
(Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to no last term.	10.977810170300877
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?	12.745259615477048
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).	11.1657179836305
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?	8.745001555549068
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.	9.520537877738343
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?	9.45166156019194
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.	7.311129855144958
Envy?	32.172570290454246
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.	8.026703133376174
Jealousy?	32.172570290454246
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction.	7.6969764389692505
Because attraction between agent(s) and reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance.	8.26476505627403
Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.	11.881510926006468
Abnegation?	32.172570290454246
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.	5.427083767995397
Equanimity?	32.172570290454246
As as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.	8.245678465556944
As not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of a collision with a dark sun.	13.804633626402735
As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king’s enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder.	4.755484657366525
As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease.	5.90617003395071
As more than inevitable, irreparable.	11.299685460655743
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?	7.513151439470915
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.	9.559530002993489
What retribution, if any?	16.5032013479186
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right.	8.87765294139156
Duel by combat, no.	5.547623796128568
Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet.	6.925661119712142
Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly.	6.713238254178204
Hushmoney by moral influence, possibly.	7.618951632278124
If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting the separator from both.	6.492086623499959
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?	9.162323521462332
The preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the selfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.	8.219143140075747
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?	7.556482996864121
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.	7.186197038280199
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?	11.09161593049059
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation: a silent contemplation.	10.856710122405024
Then?	32.172570290454246
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.	8.89943965540751
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?	11.09161593049059
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.	10.261838132538522
What followed this silent action?	9.592684031838086
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.	5.285513522782967
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?	14.536602819346996
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown.	8.418944282515893

Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?	9.573553570628944
Absolutely.	32.172570290454246
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?	12.416356702783498
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.	11.983176134119635
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?	6.529549284189481
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz.	10.386268913376835
8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz.	9.919705153781567
27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ.	10.051369077404694
By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.	8.897525008871646
How?	17.705247751504768
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.	9.875241030696076
What moved visibly above the listener’s and the narrator’s invisible thoughts?	14.139978169700669
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.	8.270208441452416

• [ 18 ] Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the _City Arms_ hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods _Ave Maria_ what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket _O Maria Santisima_ he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _Stabat Mater_ by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the 7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5 minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I’ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their 3 Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid

Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the 2 things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the 2 of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after

matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly this morning see she wrote a letter to

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly 20 years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about 40 perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the

they havent passion God help their poor head I knew more about men and life when I was 15 than theyll all know at 50 they dont know how to sing a song like that Gardner said no man could look at my mouth and teeth smiling like that and not think of it I was afraid he mightnt like my accent first he so English all father left me in spite of his stamps Ive my mothers eyes and figure anyhow he

them like that a bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for 3 forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our 4 sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait 3 quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their 20 pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart _sweet_heart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats 11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after that the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15 yesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose hes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ 1 or perhaps 30/- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent 1 or 2 questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at 7 1/2d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar 11d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might
