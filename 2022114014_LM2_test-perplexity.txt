415.94811068472274
I shall now know how to act.	149.67417042771078
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	503.13960616651445
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	541.6998408902028
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.	238.1720331887363
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	927.0441808113521
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	447.02803581357307
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court." "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	681.7823633312028
I dearly love a laugh." "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	141.45450720576184
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.	86.65429046200074
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	593.3490658650567
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	243.83926210424298
Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them.	530.6366989152052
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	387.2998931123871
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	103.16809900206007
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	356.4994380179098
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn." Elizabeth looked surprised.	86.20842997032396
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	741.0585324680998
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.	290.43199910226156
Younger sons cannot marry where they like." "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do." "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money." "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	585.9981335024632
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment." His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.	631.5797928301732
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	550.2746104084924
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.	575.2576425544903
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	551.2947929972336
Now is your time.	167.22234898163552
CHAPTER X.	45.377925046408194
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	493.9071581928331

Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	426.9255306092923
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	504.08682515953484
But she is nothing to me now.	45.95877178700823
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	598.4164605789862
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	210.00623515003969
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	227.1412370961978
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.	154.11217821692009
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	47.05369941199484
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride." "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "Yes.	538.5197769110259
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together." Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	229.33380457570567
When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.	816.8124838477587
Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.	591.7577814909733
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	553.9853425044846
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day." "Oh, yes.	129.51809494703508
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.	909.9217847344083
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	336.88378096350215
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.	273.19406205418335
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	239.43662533186819
I am sure you will be very comfortable there.	91.78923802225144
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.	769.9022729285207
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did." The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	745.9750670092297
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	897.6730809433758
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	539.5467820132317
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	864.0129434527627
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	815.2149909704536
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	898.0036313583316
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	447.82369040424004
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals." "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library." Mrs.	789.7319210675184
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	66.82186558748606
She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father, and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.	382.95680145999916
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	8.430514405320022
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	256.1587560039198
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	319.4201940969226
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	421.7573946845552
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs.	151.10800780057838
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	544.2600737456884
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	949.8399097953898
Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.	176.04251375907182
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner." Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	1063.3723466975957
"There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way.	571.2134905891601
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	368.7535348929674
Arguments are too much like disputes.	255.56564478629716
I shall go distracted." This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	581.2649677219943
"What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion." The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	514.3628221533444
Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.	1119.2260497112263
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	58.70144357109445
His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	218.98731023584727
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	444.11949733123413
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	508.9343921422823
END OF VOL.	129.18778800866886
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	415.74616094857765
Wont it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	481.0485766740213
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.	207.4342022402154
Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me.	50.10683389674037
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	357.7315752081968
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.	185.84987585976006
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	1838.6924538326443
He has more to give.	121.80909118072314

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.	405.5294720918795
And with no one to speak to, of what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!" "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved." "Certainly.	552.5962153092961
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London." "Perfectly so--I thank you." She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?" "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	165.10871490798925
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	1101.3798007061057
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	664.0670263836436
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.	239.6052374222808
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	105.7470034633331
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	487.3187459593746
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	359.90420473855306
Is not he a charming man?	539.499847541838
It was unpardonable.	160.93322454288943
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?" "You can _now_ have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered.	344.25261381759145
He is perfectly amiable.	50.98807807845411
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.	613.3293959577948
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	324.78874211744164
It cannot be concealed from any one.	56.65323873004214
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	392.6953173184753
There was also a postscript to this effect.	466.50869622179925
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.	392.0895602103941
Who are your uncles and aunts?	596.8895253931491
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	552.8894339081218
His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.	1220.3232114895382
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	723.9319002298316
But now it was all too natural.	146.96236541848947
There was no arguing upon such a project.	379.53259420970886
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	334.2453089202546
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil." When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	441.84816247262165
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	864.011029081877
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	130.55868039406994
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	307.2630265766618
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	755.8870079029092
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	362.69892087436034
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	179.30408716609153
Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.	893.1179108960381
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	343.1756029799209
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.	298.4468347415376
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	420.97845814913353
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	536.8139086396718
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.	372.16028196363186
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	793.2322063170791
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	210.60563086443366
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	948.0958678084211
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	197.7970884628264
He replied, and was again silent.	275.4313037182794
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice." "_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition." "Certainly not." "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	268.5364286700785
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	83.18855499025624
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	398.10558285425196
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	715.7582088179685
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	225.47972065054742
But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible.	641.2538351512759
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	389.1320979051784
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?" Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	433.71795199382706
But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments.	534.9256705604307
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	247.18348350033423
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	141.74073863286318
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	706.4258396738486
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	549.1276661296708
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	481.37657908060345
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.	236.34138675515015
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	104.73007328742337
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	153.0278286350874
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	1356.205217314979
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	315.87755944728485
Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	662.8883736513185
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	505.78113203068045
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	807.4330660247498
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	244.63666910032953
As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown?	529.8462413372883

Their parties abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them, threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp.	1364.299159963842
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	146.45911099019725
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	222.1378455592824
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed." "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.	727.5070896405772
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
London: Printed for T.	311.0775386841113
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	48.753163607134184
Her own thoughts were employing her.	312.9532751639586
He looked serious as usual; and she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley.	65.13903971620852
Mr. Darcy may hug himself." "Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.	41.561822641633505

Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	1017.0562534619158
The day passed much as the day before had done.	331.8667251908437
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	297.29512319814467
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	345.7272286315714
We want none of them; do we?" Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	391.5748785897504
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	387.1664777414873
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.	1215.2143435791527
I hate such false friends.	321.40762798111825
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.	625.7900860292888
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.	349.9130303910415
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?" "I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.	225.3233412662805
It is useless to talk of it." It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	381.08594906101365
Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her.	335.9673617119915
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	688.0384139650528
To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit.	180.2569006619199
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	200.0253966235704
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.	272.9841749158526
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.	652.6893971139629
Have all her friends left her?" "Mrs.	70.32023049294924
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	109.95555361357407
I shall like it of all things.	431.48401180643697
Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.	557.8311874097011
Any other inconsistencies with modern spellings have been left as printed.	1017.0562534619158
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	437.10070528837224
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	622.3405510209913
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	698.569552794161
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	175.7813686879158
Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.	943.7255549153031
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication.	227.29020392582902
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.	528.724628064213
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united." Mrs.	242.64927794039664
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy." "I desire you will do no such thing.	323.74223404244157
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	1390.2180810591265
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	671.8591904515173
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	386.05118593530636
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	467.53564935133187
Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness.	679.5950867998266
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	132.08111450944125
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	555.7438999055447
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	213.3657596087529
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	188.50942860422182
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	626.651784977967
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it." Darcy mentioned his letter.	102.44166172536865
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	296.75197371496233
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	602.2161879562339
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	1029.964143796568
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	459.33263135354605
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	658.8415172725058
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	466.31663679738165
She really looked almost wild." "She did indeed, Louisa.	262.51871541401033
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	427.4457823332354
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	566.3729835394251
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	468.7637743701853
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.	456.4847083738945
But that is not the case _here_.	57.94627345443201
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations.	546.7871034692238
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	693.6115358859328
Gardiner abused her stupidity.	202.80821299505413
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	472.5839575284234
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips." "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to." "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	172.64866488172456
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.	40.05447095294556
Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.	93.80903540163449
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	792.1770224548592
Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	333.6415495367581
Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.	417.6640808783066
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	1113.2787709430781
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	347.3039573869589
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	237.34389831535702

She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	962.0547582163209
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations." "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	549.4430834509227
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	910.9827957409583
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	403.52710466467164
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	636.2100400255734
He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you, Darcy?" "My style of writing is very different from yours." "Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.	204.7512400305352
But enough of this.	49.73847840982016
Besides, there was truth in his looks." "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think." "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think." But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	208.61089228605513
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	906.4136629469548
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	736.1406226806042
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.	422.1116826286133
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.	5.1635101713378635
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it." They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	174.459547470233
But I will no longer importune my young cousin." Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	622.165922695734
You shall hear what she says." She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.	698.8489454136945
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	186.41657514232352
His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	1085.537915150206
A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me.	460.66438085538897
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	240.97381309859273
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	255.68630989167463
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	283.82753988695447
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	555.642356378387
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	587.2525241845249
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	294.68457877880866
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	132.81323211214956
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you." "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him." "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	90.26069593522561
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	544.6977010155928
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	630.9008182685016

Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	321.8289626699078
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	491.37832168041615
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.	865.6777561034884
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	161.24198797931365
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	391.59805614311506
I have not the smallest hope.	41.3548099393812
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of any thing else, and totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise.	485.8580004898921
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	292.69568932754123
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	673.1460455229536
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	155.09741620983394
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild." Mrs.	136.37652659165107
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease." "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.	451.84687514518885
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	739.8612987929728
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	944.1270881027125
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.	451.1691148610685
My mind was more agreeably engaged.	470.2742174837258
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "Just as you please." "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "Take whatever you like, and get away." Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	290.40211814552663
Gardiner, though unknown.	120.5913147628981
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	323.91230478620395
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.	34.74970399913669
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	194.77650979736416
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	144.25785788328386
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	233.0775567700679
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	662.4139073648195
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	1077.991213165387
On Mr. and Mrs.	8.130503370174432
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance." "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	239.6955662240348
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you." Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	347.61183516854425
He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us.	281.50965763706
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever." The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	251.57182269159847
"If he wants our society, let him seek it.	512.1623112394038
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	662.3208292185832
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	245.8659645566711
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	92.03948741551903
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia.	115.0835069929593
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?" "To-morrow fortnight." "Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs.	56.640516336104504
for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials." "Oh, no!" said Elizabeth.	97.44834146149962
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	57.958228619419
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	252.7726865138819
The first part of Mrs.	29.982024755530315
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	413.82612884215814
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	348.54127248286903
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	44.239705071875214
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	155.465184418652
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her." "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends." "An easy distance do you call it?	224.6300794432431
Their reception at home was most kind.	553.1161011375611
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	286.5319514048354
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter.	412.44066035533524
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	312.49068179573294
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done." But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	238.00169478490938
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	192.1405477284804
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	304.63174621061677
Good bye." She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	332.029470993886
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	99.24881470335144
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	269.780287536481
For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time, had merited the severest reproof.	631.8058041179249
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	143.03898237194295
It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply the idea.	795.393987680472
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	686.4819595404789
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	468.6782639071052
And who knows what _may_ happen?	596.8895253931491
The vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	274.0841206242129
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.	331.82981644375946
It was to this effect: "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.	245.3788662921484
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy." "Are you, indeed?	94.42212666623581
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	99.6242485310458
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	205.77396827787564
I shall be back by dinner." "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required." "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	297.65950286860084
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	49.95312561022515
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	517.8257795986949
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	380.41452307897833
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	240.96480052918912
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night." Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus, "My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained.	512.9768809384226
I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers.	227.93591688865115
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	891.1298110704753
Make haste, make haste.	40.90496031744625
I am afraid you will be angry." "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	71.02015570694385
Collins so before you came.	345.73938743328716
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	282.53607924336467
As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.	825.7201836168075
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit." Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	792.5655572020517
CHAPTER V.	9.418336783573583
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	140.0660434117226
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	1008.4402798006058
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	239.65566499265796
Their other engagements were few; as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general, was beyond the Collinses' reach.	1010.9385424312298
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.	276.52693210698396
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	183.74868127282747
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable.	696.6353613909163
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	790.5269367816684
By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	647.4390023270075
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister, was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me?	334.1631828815238
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	166.2455817336701
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express.	672.0871957188465
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall if you please name the very day of the ball.	339.34815506950343
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	314.588138817983
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.	381.31382079193935
"I should never have said Mrs.	25.70239158766955
Reynolds could interest her on no other point.	687.4000038702301
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts." Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	405.7316811294382
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	231.53933090133543
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	580.6158668142994
She directly replied, "You need not be frightened.	81.44487074563071
I shall never forget her appearance this morning.	257.9680956390551
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	573.5253409461614
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	121.50048819513741
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	374.6363925488631
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy.	473.36765604099816
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	1357.0201093266642
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	485.16115961156913
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	867.5321578062897
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	548.893970446677
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	405.84670149501886
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	550.2746104084924
I came to try you.	82.09089991679222
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	549.2834151132141
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	456.086403543791
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation." Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex." Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	944.2434649609647
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	237.15940379564205
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	534.919494478382
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	781.5804228237489
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "Well, Jane, who is it from?	151.466925280596
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set downs.	421.76756747244696
Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls.	172.39555544499788
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	814.4044509225512
We had better not mention it.	135.17763081461155
CHAPTER XIV.	45.377925046408194
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her.	327.7293813451758
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.	587.3423480730316
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	79.31543879407765
They then went away.	15.934138042061676
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.	312.19753844254313
Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.	417.2440723970708
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	926.8928127407979
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly." "I must not decide on my own performance." He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.	304.9732773684176
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	180.32652612393767
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.	390.551692363986
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth.	39.307288726405304
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	648.4540942910007
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week." "What is his name?" "Bingley." "Is he married or single?" "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	263.65026429293476
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	94.93921990212526

Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled.	802.3040677231826
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	169.44305297035058
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	426.29132900764114
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman." "But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt." "Of whom does Jane ever think ill?	225.63711010865435
In understanding Darcy was the superior.	428.7518340678823
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	735.0907757044818
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	655.7028544451807
Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.	290.0161940269554
I wish I could see her.	12.390646436804797
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it." "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	407.75275606322504
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	225.56988522469928
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	144.879352972096
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North.	422.5898733910121
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	441.54661595147746
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	311.0775386841113
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	204.03027003444592
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	147.16725985463341
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	129.41763880329444
I know no harm of her." "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune." "No--why should he?	382.69828186078354
has she any family?" "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property." "Ah!" cried Mrs.	221.95673819376873
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	360.17105956893397
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	136.5813495472186
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	825.8676034397063
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay." "You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	436.1182447427856
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal." "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	109.20551668185848
She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	566.9656682366231
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	749.0101943874741
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	807.4330660247498
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	333.06205137902606
But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone.	202.9365262617173
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	608.4239673448287
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson." "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	381.4629811128615
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	492.1174844714013
Long and the Gouldings soon.	331.81840182625814
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	255.57296416332474
One seems so forlorn without them." "This is the consequence you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth.	101.20970103014699
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	575.6082068855167
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly." "Indeed you are mistaken.	424.2432919074124
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	199.89831020234072
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.	811.4744964949322
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	166.63837502720662
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.	438.2241188029104
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	276.9810001048168
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	225.58079737861885
They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.	295.58233843398807
Have you had any flirting?	454.0288746111505
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!" "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	613.2485850064583
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford." "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object." "Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife." "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	242.92647384726544
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?" "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered." She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	365.2926221703326
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	1327.0952987266405
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.	196.5570786331555
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	635.4888629594742
We must not make him desperate." The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	264.1125568005871
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.	139.9083705261388
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	660.1104460534688
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	109.61468195863468
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	285.2780219068861
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	295.5835940791142
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.	1038.6071887221042
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	1011.1413990584828
Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.	599.1806257829992
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow." This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	569.203422357025
"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_." "I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him.	327.6105533038931
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	1280.1220996950658
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large." "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan." Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	347.06223843421657

His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	230.4237166004725
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself." Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	364.8361570845313
Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante." CHAPTER XIII.	187.63835242197428
They were hopeless of remedy.	311.0775386841113
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	250.78915766748523
Her ease and good spirits increased.	227.72815161586993
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	191.90350386988342
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.	279.94318454085595
She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress.	1273.4544768504659
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	219.7222602839797
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may.	645.7221014287886
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	568.3408643342802
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	550.7801102601238
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	620.3323623282566
_She_ will not be able to help calling." "She will drop the acquaintance entirely." But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	366.0137022949271
I am perfectly satisfied.	48.544013297506154
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	99.39110696410008
It was consoling, that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush.	722.2900697872547
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.	671.8591904515173
My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made." "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?" "I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth.	370.90466561827986
My feelings will not be repressed.	191.4162883172653
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	396.25361968538624
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	78.0498530645803
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	313.30591584032356
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	38.35056742339744
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	248.54384172351592
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.	487.7154397802907
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	969.9441604698007
The next was in these words.	264.3083944518947
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind." She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	778.0924970836264
CHAPTER XI.	45.377925046408194
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.	89.81928770664264
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	323.47056503906543
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	770.7181926915982
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly." "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful." "That is as it happens.	212.56901224023778
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule." "Such as vanity and pride." "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.	500.89436492329565
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?	493.62566909877296
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	1400.5832499370656
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	218.70687067998557
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.	523.3340184295267
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!" "She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.	330.51143209032284
Bennet was stirring the fire.	132.46443114071997
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	469.44113060083095
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent." "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?" "Sometimes.	556.941306780021
You mentioned _two_ instances.	202.80821299505413
That lady I suppose is your mother." Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	176.5815977136241
Kitty, run down and order the carriage.	340.9042946979468
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	718.9286945633788
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.	567.5983969258652
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	844.238259964676
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	616.2262559643399
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	662.1371111040559
Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.	319.65402676186943
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	825.3041074304864
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.	301.6825736415672
My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how imprudent a match it must be.	342.110296797326
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	344.1537654891814
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	78.5411376463715
He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty.	377.7822459126573
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	149.8382546974063
You alluded to something else.	102.22148258855624
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers." "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?" He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	442.38776134341424
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	789.4657210901221
He has children of his own, and may have more.	98.66105239546637
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	543.1122970814556
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	473.89326917300764
He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air gloomy.	516.081594081954
How much you must have gone through!" Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	159.79723965492514
The visit was returned in due form.	624.9276977022552
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.	4.222269281302938
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	1000.8584292398141
There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.	936.7658588074628
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	317.1959490719296
_Invented by M^{rs} Bell 26 Charlotte Street Bedford Square._ _Engraved for No. 72 of La Belle Assemblee 1^{st} July 1815_] PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	808.5178437369327
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	539.7272788575285
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	207.94409156015706
CHAPTER II.	71.84810273005208
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	410.8118430072992
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	804.4105688359308
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	243.6031975494147
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.	1159.3740014929122
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	723.4264862600384
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	530.0475507800669
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable.	297.62938260580734
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
Egerton, Military Library, Whitehall.	428.7518340678823
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?" "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction." "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.	564.061252433132
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point." "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know." "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.	350.8252608905059
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	295.01011159302254
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced." Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	113.67244335677873
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	367.8916724524267
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	290.5454192011303
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	393.2828685016437
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	436.2972652507539
This information, however, startled Mrs.	146.9410131696496
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	225.26542315650866
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	221.16418252474372
Indeed he has no improper pride.	453.66348782785684
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.	1045.0455727321175
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	942.9415383111229
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	462.8016081409434
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	88.20235985406063
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	791.0676663328309
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	304.20527548266074
I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen.	536.7356673455373
She enquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice, as to the management of them all; told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as her's, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry.	392.3083272390284
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy.	791.0676663328309
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.	420.7328861998656
Have you seen any pleasant men?	596.8895253931491
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	62.7484813134712
"Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex, by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds.	160.61768848004098
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	1087.3290249598126
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	614.2871043249124
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	906.4136629469548
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy.	46.26912016493014
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	200.85085285173201
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome." "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	192.5207650246586
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	530.4164967695472
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	122.12956180244079
"MY DEAR NIECE, "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	353.4936521708824
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever." Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	981.1587486282392
And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well?	724.7626265284418
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	251.82781359092428
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone." "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	158.11055646699396
If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.	443.53375518949485
Annesley is with her.	36.754550863129914
As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.	282.2410860245772
It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	160.3017606426158
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable.	246.67889569637433
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	681.0934918598502
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	260.0518015147641
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on." "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	682.8760230881005
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	356.09135578453197
CHAPTER III.	71.84810273005208
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	1330.1726667231073
CHAPTER XVII.	45.377925046408194
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	206.54984887570015
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	424.9696361607996
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	414.24000178888303
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	433.0076599960228
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	1129.2368977059882
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	614.3828778588498
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	67.51158421178519
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	727.1287250672812
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday." "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates." This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	376.8668482781539
It was as follows: "MY DEAR SIR, "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.	444.99740042304916
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!" "I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.	486.2319146952336
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage." Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	163.77173260768734
Its completion depended on others.	313.14434486643523
"What could he mean?	147.75190051876947
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	145.60469197902316
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	199.80426733817706
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	469.36679535234606
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	105.95629464062188
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.	1450.1059584044124
You take delight in vexing me.	336.1706096358961
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	95.59497528052275
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	1783.5879033799094
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	317.15004516845164
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	547.3973276474072
Gardiner smiled.	60.41681202848144
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune." "True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it." Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	253.42104868346402
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	210.34159255654282
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	353.5902797266668

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth, "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.	69.59822758446182
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.	446.00594551021203
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.	235.42919379818963
Gardiner.	14.871494831187647
I will try again.	96.12075014719296
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	243.703781467595
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten." "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.	713.5488808909467
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.	190.76255099997402
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?	197.55093974955187
Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.	135.52882510718493
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	387.06931259060826
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	136.68070853841027
The very last evening was spent there; and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.	483.6562163569658
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	473.249965552768
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself." "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	436.48015163451106
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	767.7053376144236
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require." "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	282.38284081196855
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	260.77026158796747
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	539.5774485679648
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	458.5337570139404
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	50.1221674575675
CHAPTER XII.	45.377925046408194
Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	155.26596041378147
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you." Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	139.23556035515531
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	510.6356879573083
These were the contents: "MY DEAR HARRIET, "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	492.10983837455814
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	631.0576492912597
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	641.230747804248
Women fancy admiration means more than it does." "And men take care that they should." "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine." "I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	454.9604016177991
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	228.64003639419712
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	280.44785257459887
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	146.7823117885797
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	419.3759067488158
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	278.4834131077293
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	238.8769335896964
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	718.8543391535562
Bennet and the children.	156.98019298181816
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	255.38966704517503
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	66.66116481527638
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn." She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	520.3940864071159
If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.	542.1052935947541
Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.	738.892207574809
"DEAR SIR, "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	363.97776023643354
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	231.94548609696113
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	103.7059186822579
But it is all, all too late now." "I am grieved, indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked.	219.7533499586801
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's." CHAPTER XVIII.	136.82274869787375
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!" "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.	250.96472706932394
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	568.9514688208674
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	64.38693209743398
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	182.0614131286772
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	769.3976132934188
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	148.6796386696966
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	166.29278867472632
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	453.6807317443217
Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.	656.6950556580073
Does she live near you, sir?" "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence." "I think you said she was a widow, sir?	334.5481258824537
Let us hope for better things.	248.78855836192963
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	443.58378665106153
"I am sorry it went off.	36.108700360136126
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer." "Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?" "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady." "And what arts did he use to separate them?" "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	872.2973796094819
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	893.360854310059
But will they make you happy?" "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" "None at all.	152.64813116283304
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.	273.4891334150406
It is every way horrible!" Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	632.2209041514418
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	916.5051792730881
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode.	1317.912780332217
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	418.6279291034527
I must beg to return to the house." And she rose as she spoke.	306.04295011966155
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	378.27960320004615
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?" "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	731.317581551978
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	262.02036694678475
Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	619.466753868552
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	246.6464400185056
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	179.76867135027598
If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all." * * * * * The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs.	285.929879773318
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.	427.06836787572524
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	345.8866009215851
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	342.6967143509204
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	1916.2267379288674
"Or in other words, you are determined to have him.	75.24176578879708
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?" "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron." "You have.	371.7411115251725
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	219.65049895930002
I hope he will overlook it.	60.40120542619734
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	236.22737072499336
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.	162.63356102381857
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	299.348708839567
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	506.7949819261899
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	647.6448084584142
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
It was really a very handsome thought.	158.755797780299
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	179.34669088653573
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	917.6158272971714
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	396.4814712460988
Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's prudent, steady character.	342.53244050221724
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	424.81486884953665
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?" Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little." "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?" "Yes, very handsome." "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	251.71749874290012
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	518.809222496074
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight." "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	215.19410566279055
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.	143.44063548652898
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	932.8152596471734
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	869.1938591374201
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	550.2746104084924
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	457.3031575936692
Darcy may be guessed.	202.80821299505413
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	480.7571414269726
Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton." "Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down to table.	249.79484123594222
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	588.7754386568945
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation." She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	362.1929059874905
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	99.19276471098225
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	664.1571014789814
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	974.1912064845261
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	757.554123005373
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	83.14556059459942
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you." Jane shook her head.	353.9007264636164
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	577.5376243734227
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	226.57533875824228
A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little.	618.774709843969
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	412.1269779221583
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected.	354.81680847208315
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents.	129.8903597031723
In Three Volumes.	111.42667631744358
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	906.72253602146
CHAPTER XI.	45.377925046408194
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling." "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	296.30341952538504
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	177.7814250141543
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund.	871.9504394945287
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	688.2745026134007
She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise.	534.2206375965609
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	1038.2441285758985
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	29.4361198929705
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	461.5833460388658
There was another reason too for her opposition.	671.8591904515173
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again." However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	834.1470274290093
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	376.07201883215777
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience." During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	320.5005479137233
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	928.5598959558674
They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to send, but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain.	404.70335815349483
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings.	124.97940975002396
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	935.4115339102196
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	243.12541923433312
On Saturday he came again.	255.38966704517503
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	55.65485592687781
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	555.8455122990284
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	397.7588966494113
Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage.	393.2639053633076
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	381.64187405264806
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	1422.1777483652527
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_." Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	115.81995889434342
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.	688.0881207791676
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	874.9643489784859
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.	474.2038606215578
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	365.29918950552883
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	188.14620369275997
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.	244.89999971572777
You had much better dance." "I certainly shall not.	115.03216739896884
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	100.17765205982853
One came from her books, and the other from her toilette.	276.91457220747463
There was no want of discourse.	37.57486868421275
There is nothing he would not do for her." The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn.	219.7608031151897
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	429.16917805941887
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	1341.98078689775
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	116.69311956354495
Elizabeth silently attended her.	133.28569836627656
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	539.499847541838
You know I have.	202.80821299505413
CHAPTER XVIII.	9.418336783573583
The motive professed, was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character, to love or confide in him.	350.97894269272194
She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house." Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer.	102.36522334036303
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	505.08431365213676
As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.	251.03712761803047
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs.	83.57795183943284
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	664.560569020505
He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	222.36692922219464
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	631.405693269846
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	59.85644297856211
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	241.85997887144669
Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down.	324.43302557735933
Professor Michael S.	160.93322454288943
Bennet followed her, saying, "I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself.	164.26937548366575

I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	465.1843749852445
He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.	306.93308131181436
Bennet.	9.368454690608061
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	805.4824883693523
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	415.4300677891481
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them." The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	541.9205269301384
An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.	245.2245343768098
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	553.2692477275989
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.	275.48114348704166
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	467.65135021248153
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	482.6365123098677
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you." He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	248.22278409232533
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	468.2817379792905
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	1055.6747777092007
"You look pale.	112.9794708098656
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	133.94889601554314
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	461.4993243127447
The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty.	408.15620677504705
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	176.25682240501845
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	614.0126608848001
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule." "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	415.2832527671381
At length however Mrs.	113.09453118386905
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way." As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	419.9581863491969
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	104.76221514773881
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!" But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	861.5214004189214
And when I returned home, the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time.	604.5994913744879
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety." "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you." "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either." "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	477.8688796172006
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	544.788648965128
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them.	460.10427261568043
If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.	57.008672347775665
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	547.2230266195235
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.	151.67365319344475
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	898.2599144012297
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	426.8184476060639
"Yours, &c." "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders." "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	82.93806280013597
With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.	1262.9520807522692
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.	484.6214592318186
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	852.3331296386573
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	197.22403075906126
Forster, the delight of Mrs.	15.390079738281637
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?" Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	588.5572615939874
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child.	315.5145468129202
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	469.1879961446846
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	888.3671714882277
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself." Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	504.9324087626501
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	967.692539258152
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	91.3414545392947
As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult together as to what is to be done." "Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs.	115.75866530259135
In a few minutes, Mrs.	8.793913984174903
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	217.226374143854
"She is happy, then," said her father, drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration." Then, after a short silence, he continued, "Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shews some greatness of mind." They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.	255.78606008187845
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	317.840136428106
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	1445.7610475294662
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	165.65673831253298
"Mrs.	2.4770663776715756
We had better go into the avenue." But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	284.96337644201594
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	389.85367337878193
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	571.9572640590919
You know my sentiments." "You are then resolved to have him?" "I have said no such thing.	140.88550181490632
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	110.0874401456528
is not this an agreeable surprise?" "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	695.8806471550145
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley.	355.5534771787658
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	129.60242793686393
I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.	314.47512674567355
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing." "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	694.4663256974175
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	685.2795544042824
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	447.0705289202615
These recollections will not do at all.	110.46219023942541
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	476.6240316154713

When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	337.3836238069059
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?	625.0639100868161
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	520.0209895879939
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	541.8833725606754
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	404.2343922447516
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	751.884599412388
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	423.72615384160554
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure.	372.06001401396327
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	462.2421271346359
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	598.4263719973255
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	361.9544184620272
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it.	162.23159537354195
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	136.20341336868174
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	1284.6375991275545
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	1317.912780332217
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	1022.1527330281207
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	472.15522618751226
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance." The effect was immediate.	341.91513824098456
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.	355.89162436314643
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	252.5010714673882
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	57.828264450334565
It is too long ago.	104.44212960790327
The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks." She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success.	283.0210207638564
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	546.5812623380739
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	40.4433157662511
Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together.	71.75808129834739
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now." "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	103.23264430921228
I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy.	733.0570391380975
They had frequently been staying with her in town.	218.24572653407853
But let me advise you to think better of it.	33.65125695325881
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing.	662.7042436007661
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party.	431.30774628885206
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	537.1372088316148
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	72.52783314027285
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won, and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs.	99.26566430034102
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	714.0257579774674
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.	442.55312950134913
The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron.	489.62075855177
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	336.1088516451958
He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.	183.70432744181136
Without a governess you must have been neglected." "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.	695.645250682403
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?	409.441410172208
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	407.99465911666823
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	1162.7075326933161
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.	519.044399795986
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.	373.68047419995054
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	107.83348794200927
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	502.1664260250356
He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.	312.6577542947925
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood." Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	205.47617604041622
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	1447.543438049328
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: "My dearest Lizzy, "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	554.3773572128832
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	177.16887591539253
She followed him with her eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly! "A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love?	759.5414864685097
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	256.5005614780993
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	668.1279119902302
The business was therefore soon settled.	431.24335884748933
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	92.98523087816125
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	801.6660029134669
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	426.0163796416876
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	179.907974500293
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	142.024072338663
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.	800.914692827454
Mrs.	3.157300082961277
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	142.7133272676561
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.	386.9444350705025
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	1703.0723004942563
There is nothing else to be done.	34.80189960597532
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	89.30561927128925
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	249.04250800139855
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.	1329.5394458347366
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?" Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	1107.822217986335
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	603.5159653501296
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns." "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit." "Let me be rightly understood.	565.6271857847952
I know your disposition, Lizzy.	157.93658343743155
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	76.71084607609065
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed, "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	482.4326102281841
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	111.76877758964199
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	560.0758090799318
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	121.8642699820681
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.	150.46165458869174
Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change.	1122.581811016668
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	79.50808500879936
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	563.1682870251583
It is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them both----" "Then it is, as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!" Elizabeth read on; "I have seen them both.	154.3003199195051
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." "Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	252.56577473633482
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	577.5542179295973
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	172.11815001587397
Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.	264.166874423649
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	1138.1169334965812
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?	1130.1040236432968
He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and every body hoped that he would never come there again.	278.70126859234205
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	579.7970437065679
It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend." "She seems a very pleasant young woman," said Bingley.	304.8100683854622
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time.	122.0664848712548
Mr. Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary.	893.9686448612197
'Ah! Mrs.	113.09453118386905
CHAPTER VII.	9.418336783573583
But Mrs.	18.89638517519413
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	237.83026942804375
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	152.36808834935388
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	336.27298633321055
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	226.42198511996824
