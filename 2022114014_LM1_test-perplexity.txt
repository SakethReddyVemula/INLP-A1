[Illustration: MATLOCK] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: A Novel.	37.94745172424713
I will read it to you-- "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	648.47268703254
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	686.8366361753582
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	310.46078658904565
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	524.5774842375704
Long.	10.21165445170129
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	855.8200059353601
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	1124.24065715349
Their manners are not equal to his." "Certainly not; at first.	238.647699640859
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.	145.95769145538182
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.	359.6441764617187
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	475.7924305817163
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	1055.4744990804575
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	89.65798432189251
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	468.14173116660197
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him." Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	678.0458021144395
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	359.9663843903329
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	1238.3715532887736
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	906.1067181995321
Jane now came up.	224.9372239473356
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character.	172.50909284831903
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy." To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	449.32406658947934
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	755.2014867946817
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind.	2315.940900606025
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	154.92049569845204
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	737.5608019002185
On both sides it was only assertion.	450.11440459893964
When a woman has five grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty." "In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of." "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood." "It is more than I engage for, I assure you." "But consider your daughters.	315.88607581853665
Did he know of their intending to go off?	973.8358030744837
But I know the foundation is unjust.	535.9780690297955
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	437.4238998881443
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	407.7854371353228
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.	107.69098956304907
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.	953.1627344702405
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?	1819.707752719381
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.	171.60470810201303
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	561.3521473074854
CHAPTER IX.	45.09363045435656
But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly." "And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did.	293.42729166694556
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	687.4694919967426
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	159.61616167125524
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	525.9921632994337
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	1125.9904040989613
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	396.67574885140687
Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.	86.80615196733542
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	432.29781574103293
Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.	533.1423003272577
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	208.54710177005447
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	1141.862179308938
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister.	321.6807578471296
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	386.771215157369
It mortifies me.	76.1816600285274
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	582.8755961775014
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.	464.4102081279822
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	876.2536486417296
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	645.6982722395213
What a fine thing for our girls!" "How so?	507.4132697745258

Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.	660.8431715155967
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	331.33883631518444
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	126.39946338330955
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me." "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies." "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	618.8040109578776
CHAPTER X.	45.09363045435656
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back, and write immediately.	66.37117883573302
Bennet.	9.8240657223746
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	30.020815461510335
I am impatient to see him." "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective.	309.16034917277665
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	49.886262160634516
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	101.81593200774832
Why was he to be the judge?" "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" "I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	385.2079301890248
If he no longer cares for me, why silent?	642.4551731058104
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	1280.8121944551513
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.	190.5394488939271
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance.	902.8386619909901
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	415.751284427835
They must have seen them together for ever." "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	414.2560451992499
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin.	1288.4389150203804
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	313.759752297143
She looked at Jane, and smiled, and shook her head by turns.	77.82465829387974
Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.	397.37838497297025
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.	419.7893779701932
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	262.7952258929319
Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.	466.62848251170834
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met.	984.8473649820581
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	1198.9405501854264
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately.	311.15853387188525
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	240.75099004206686
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	1597.0143908796026
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	535.9780690297955
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	753.2078996614658
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject." "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	345.44016744627635
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	380.4357117171972

A carat character is used to denote superscription.	653.3555208014494
Her father captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour, which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind, had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her.	689.6391274599931
What did Colonel Forster say?	116.14943057054263
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	86.14906940949082
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	211.3058045290237
What could your ladyship propose by it?" "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted." "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence." "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	377.0191266663244
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	656.8182099673902
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil." When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	550.806738092251
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	209.9551176526202
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses.	73.48015948577734
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	43.09403282502409
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	819.4590190880413
On the following Monday, Mrs.	53.995418083824724
Forster, the delight of Mrs.	20.193570416272255
The one missent must be first attended to; it had been written five days ago.	882.8703439606895
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	707.2368424761729
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	365.9140108541924
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	316.85905144091043
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.	384.4965614505411
Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.	372.8326964412872
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	306.1630944111915
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	320.72842415786477
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	258.626087964914
GARDINER." Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	121.11383664855286
Their reception at home was most kind.	538.2498715331595
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	512.0922959042964
Section 2.	6.182738190967649
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.	341.7447842770811
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	1257.03526320226
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	1030.5736029120712
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" "Yes, Ma'am, all." "All!--What, all five out at once?	257.35803047454476
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	622.9380727963387
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	905.5599774618211
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	1171.1234383937183
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.	872.0331436391435
And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them, after they are married.	1162.2873990000214
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	171.1271187321662
While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends?	578.4964206276433
The dejection was almost universal.	304.3865521175247
To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long.	781.788874601041
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case." "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly." This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	204.8726260489128
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	494.7534831737477
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	606.9007257912561
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	722.299851139457
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	431.57001416137405
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure." "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	474.5109480023837
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr. Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	680.6403223646502
They are gone off together from Brighton.	581.3420157069213
Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair.	582.1529297051134
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	393.1926615363536
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	58.1380196055627
He is perfectly amiable.	111.0334930362489
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	799.7983023331061
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	100.49902512111892
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.	768.0656417418454
The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.	283.1096690783806
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	640.6750744109892
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	246.38067303665935
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	279.0168647532541
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	367.63805525028704
I came to try you.	107.4499602334471
She directly replied, "You need not be frightened.	82.58870621008661
We neither of us perform to strangers." Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	311.97194660803416
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	1297.8213463477798
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend." "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	225.96927854642362
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here.	1225.4428064210756
I always said it must be so, at last.	115.97925788715904
Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion.	52.093929675925004
Mr. what's his name.	581.3420157069213
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course." "No, no.	58.59742598239252
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	1022.4528703445411
The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with.	487.79453008309224
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none.	213.23015473704632
But now several minutes elapsed, without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground.	618.186938161893
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	1719.955895250663
The discomposure of spirits, which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.	322.309302128779
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	1361.0211708186657
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	323.83685362515763
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	524.4133682152748
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	796.2724246591775
But do not imagine that he is always here so often.	201.84203664123382
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	771.2124775087264
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	519.8528381647417
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	1337.0144490397731
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	871.6875721734554
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	800.9664759705256
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	214.88609852033483
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	86.99429523729374
CHAPTER XVIII.	8.202299911402216
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.	912.256197140293
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	747.4594786815354
It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.	1150.3670999719452
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.	962.3701636062933
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	763.717390928979
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.	135.7313762240663
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	587.7556626632512
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	510.8377335643976
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	419.8023567206107
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	540.9829279847924
Bennet."--My mind however is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England.	937.258056504684
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.	738.7232771030493
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?	120.81715750926702
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	704.5731861969003
He danced only four dances! I am sorry to pain you--but so it was.	73.97561605676387
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.	819.6733569380636
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	243.18547104746972
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for." In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	187.97446478963442
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	533.7594437327424
She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.	535.200474481362
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	868.8431930507309
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way." But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	474.38612564985107
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other.	340.6784197419952
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect.	395.836843593235
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room." She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.	303.6964278612018
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go." "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	322.6161367711771
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	266.8916325352954
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	149.72468339046227
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	847.0268284018262
She shared in their attendance on Mrs.	150.72940529957202
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life." "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think." "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	190.22420878932982
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	786.0559770761366
At length, she spoke again.	115.25216126831265
There can be no love in all this.	55.252732261313135
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	713.7798820805209
CHAPTER VIII.	45.09363045435656
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.	713.447223918287
They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.	723.7826680075713
He begged pardon for having displeased her.	405.3545986135416
Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.	912.3902135859652
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	249.98288019648876
Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley." "I wish it may." "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model.	480.74193890267907
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more.	385.2056103665991
"I cannot see why Mrs.	98.65298313747374
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	264.4951599480065
has she any family?" "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property." "Ah!" cried Mrs.	297.9128288724005
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	444.10673912077465
Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.	598.1119883267957
To Mrs.	18.97023906303445
It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours." "Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home." "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character.	314.82553462522793
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	197.88530084764767
Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer.	522.2066463438044
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.	412.1960966008096
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	1337.0144490397731
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy." "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir." "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	258.90068003569456
He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.	268.0749891589446
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	525.2525204124363
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	635.7402607145815
They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought.	269.28237542425853
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	1041.934845460598
I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire." "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better.	228.92945368199585
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.	414.290552365879
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.	237.02391775346922
It will pass away soon enough." "Do you suppose them to be in London?" "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	328.54767906323025
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs.	96.78816958870533
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	362.67716169958527
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however." "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it." "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever." "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	331.1887094156865
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	881.958945285847
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	197.5162941148031
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	738.345374714877
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	850.8196105481625
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	241.2277748733554
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married." It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	484.2685956008715
I have not the smallest hope.	39.371931510653944
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?" Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	396.20525094906895
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	771.2308345685019
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more.	277.8304494811405
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	653.3555208014494
In short, I will do my best." "Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often.	306.6947155184857
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	475.13262660275103
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.	589.4228009514883
This he considered sufficient encouragement, and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her, immediately followed.	399.2548996603428
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth: "My dearest Lizzy, "I FIND myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.	551.7683922473857
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	1183.4698588556705
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.	113.72823126816355
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	383.67014874188663
It was first broken by Mrs.	96.85204600109708
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	691.5803132539427
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it." "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	545.9715119292814
It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling." "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	410.24745845680815
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer." "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	281.3342647012794
_They_ will never be distressed for money.	304.0303172418311
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	450.15384085489916
I send no compliments to your mother.	182.6261119720929
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	625.6519791095807
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	802.8471255407068
Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence.	688.5643890504756
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	657.157682140985
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject." "Not so hasty, if you please.	212.12135369176073
"I should never have said Mrs.	24.308929912332864
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	531.713763370561
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	253.58295551362863
This letter is from Mr. Collins." "From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?" "Something very much to the purpose of course.	204.83050493609727
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.	661.3148221860382
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner.	853.1559596855317
"You write uncommonly fast." "You are mistaken.	119.65529593882495
"A gamester!" she cried.	83.05698841583337
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	1222.6912189076102
It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor.	917.7842612460051
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	779.5450967998904
CHAPTER XXII.	45.09363045435656
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	656.3629037865197
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	231.916088452616
In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.	741.3534795367294
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.	1138.0298480057274
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	542.2242700911078
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	1390.475642879741
Long.	10.21165445170129
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	104.36729695236505
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	969.122975661375
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	342.9294177968671
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	107.53885520970759
Section 1.	6.182738190967649
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	677.8601562680905
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	163.07671662096865
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	229.71952270851577
Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask." "What do you mean, Hill?	215.33830976982003
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!" Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	488.1395906716709
Mr. Collins made his declaration in form.	378.0773972205206
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	246.87160233066362
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	499.9455502544546
Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.	985.7578325848689
But are you pleased, Jane?	579.7332518074871
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	339.7019500159867
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	688.261280276515
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam.	54.09433803698183
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	700.6511830907165
"She is so fond of Mrs.	72.58452589444606
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	415.69817772242425
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.	1042.364830044383
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it." "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	300.48870807066993
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	741.7552950408625
What is your own opinion?" "That it ought not to be attempted.	268.0762284477989
His principal object must be, to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.	846.5406740627279
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford.	259.7337940684159
You may have drawn him in." "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it." "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	214.05622369595028
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	449.31791218418823
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.	216.38914749231785
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.	485.2189432943746
"You look pale.	137.0244374874901
London: Printed for T.	304.3865521175247
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	535.9780690297955
She certainly did not hate him.	306.617272284462
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do." Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	506.5892531523029
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now." "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	136.6472956259783
She shall hear my opinion." Mrs.	93.61101016066476
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	704.8810325408698
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.	23.42857330821709
Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead.	207.21122149486973
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	724.8226105492619
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	389.1398754926297
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	177.79647180101614
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	428.0891033148854
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	617.6624756313782
So imprudent a match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	187.72683110460912
Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn." Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.	466.26372908829603
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	550.5802780864567
The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.	149.8522212336978
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	554.6749878914874
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	165.06209287962415
"I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself.	345.40841488459586
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	498.75315906435793

When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	322.2623627856057
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him, without saying a word.	63.2423288413678
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; every body had been most kind and attentive to him, there had been no formality, no stiffness, he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.	604.5407080728293
How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves.	1380.487022408394
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	223.42835583548052
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	115.62293992033517
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	283.58917064655805
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	329.95563693961174
They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing to him.	123.75493650268572
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	454.4562344748348
Adieu.	10.21165445170129
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	57.014447475559294
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	938.4689858317602
I know no harm of her." "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune." "No--why should he?	436.79214051921775
To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again.	318.04385526762167
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	427.241863257914
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me." "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter." Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	279.2874382352484
Collins knew not what to make of him.	33.03499560309734
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage." Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	327.85031940030615
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	902.1725839761954
I know we dine with four and twenty families." Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.	2009.4918896914812
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.	115.51103705422192
It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.	162.2651430404267

With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	705.7385684790187
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	1121.6682568374968
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire-place, that she might be farther from the door.	402.6928094724913
Till this moment, I never knew myself." From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	526.4886502769217
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	720.0679936111359

Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	713.5866575116157
There is nothing else to be done.	32.0439999089641
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	1337.0144490397731
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	193.0101677762283
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.	322.95385362409445
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	899.8009728390502
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	432.4057448254704
As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs.	86.2047742595722
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	373.4804269974338
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	1787.423734078999
Hill began instantly to express her joy.	135.845916446417
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation." When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.	1604.6118051695162
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	363.47805771536235
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane.	279.0421122413894
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.	37.70106184637802
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	701.8288833444467
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	580.7796593159289
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	1276.6370209725385
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	600.1282652220098
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it was rather too early to begin.	328.49696946444266
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.	701.341531203782
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	781.2359857856721
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride." "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "Yes.	544.815628796264
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large." "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan." Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	349.32728917463874
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	521.136117697434
CHAPTER IX.	45.09363045435656
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	791.1941684233609
If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.	466.5226212787404
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	1267.2091110489712
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	487.41932357031595
He has been accused of many faults at different times; but _this_ is the true one.	1057.3802021050449
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow." This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	563.4485768393723
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	152.8263993425479
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	516.6947296081812
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	467.34173409663185
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	371.2737038249211
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	565.0569847326398
Let me mend it for you.	135.47411239572926
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	578.6233886367
The visit was returned in due form.	608.1313711786105
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!" "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	94.78957600327925
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	87.5520183470926
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	593.777585323132
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town." Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	480.7473607028755
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	476.93770768049245
She will make him a very proper wife." Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	710.2806446694534
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	805.585370528605
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	263.0541637775571
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	387.650494318779
If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon." But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into, was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news, which then began to be in circulation.	958.8461988098378
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	874.588325859718
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.	537.7654688696482
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved." "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading." "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	1051.6169854327538
And yet, upon my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment.	170.62053412280193
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court." "Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament.	822.1160211627787
Send back your answer as soon as you can, and be careful to write explicitly.	356.5961479860236
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	535.9780690297955

They look upon it quite as their own, I dare say, whenever that happens." "It was a subject which they could not mention before me." "No. It would have been strange if they had.	216.85099068714914
Hurst were going out.	191.0145907381626
Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.	262.94249389803326
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	1000.8524401189796
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me." "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced." "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	259.52857801914433
I knew you would be wishing me joy." "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled.	413.91810027123347
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	536.4019896813161
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	887.7009241411205
We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.	367.4791507421351
I am not romantic you know.	125.76242374027923
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "This walk is not wide enough for our party.	540.9477661901983
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	464.9722453688522
If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him.	244.44086658610382
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	1429.1436172849767
Bennet very dull for several days.	525.9921632994337
The loo table, however, did not appear.	102.36445668452527
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	203.32935413100165
The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs.	337.1042548725584
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	983.7650997349823
Bennet could not give her consent, or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was.	455.91107504494346
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer." "Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?" "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady." "And what arts did he use to separate them?" "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	768.3224832007302
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!" Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	585.4733874692662
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller." "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	286.9674086475282
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	191.91938940702983
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	463.222917783036
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	715.9390915659178
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	68.34029380442657
Bennet.	9.8240657223746
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	1622.8887534028495
They have at least that advantage." "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	390.29097207018833
As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.	1805.9411269227228
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	327.28186483797487
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	319.75323770203585
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	289.62706418364854
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	1375.648794395451
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	824.5668147188575
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	188.50045428161258
But who was your mother?	441.81064270996546
Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.	824.6062837120156
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	514.7893671038638
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	734.8483397370915
They followed her into the dining-parlour.	33.44768263265163
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said, "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned.	519.0834756027207
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	762.8949527351114
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	908.4744893081224
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	951.1286569433844
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them." "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	907.279847140387
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	463.0569418621849
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.	113.42316275165922
CHAPTER III.	71.25019758101287
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!" "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.	321.3305293322933
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	576.0234512863198
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.	999.5191690505042
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon.	702.9512177560683
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.	45.769948296494356
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	409.40295384942465
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.	645.2816280972169
But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable.	626.9452965686617
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	244.25389268081335
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	1332.0675153653392
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	935.639681488991
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	240.54485037907259
By nature inoffensive, friendly and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.	149.94084222031955
You alluded to something else.	102.90796089327068
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow." Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.	812.9693182307677
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	1141.0259966296135
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.	11.749616801572182
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	304.3865521175247
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	892.8288066729056
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true." "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger.	583.2496863855195
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	345.0372697590196
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	383.20031621551374
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?" Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	359.80840748972344
Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.	286.2649930348903
[Illustration: A VICARAGE HOUSE.] PRIDE AND PREJUDICE: A Novel.	90.37654097996342
Elizabeth did all she could, to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.	572.5941316650462
Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	318.22840061636435
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy." "I desire you will do no such thing.	338.5298320295628
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
but no one can throw any blame on them.	99.93103675244437
Yours ever, "CAROLINE BINGLEY." "With the officers!" cried Lydia.	469.3409597017843
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	1083.167142790008
Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them.	1016.5470986632757
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	319.15690654748886
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	876.5848793656606
"Can you come to-morrow?" Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.	346.5953433963617
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	662.1404735644883
At present I will say nothing about it." "You are quite right.	21.961641524976166
I will put on my things in a moment.	274.82510597548134
Collins.	13.030173174487512
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	708.8506285975632
Can I speak plainer?	307.5483890188963
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.	519.7300299444091
Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.	529.2395814067177
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	494.56619596999957
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	74.49800644202585
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.	1052.1086513307664
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	395.9631148650572
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	643.3100021506451
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not." "You are over scrupulous surely.	105.052350479528
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	1456.2389774017406
is she handsome?" "She is a most charming young lady indeed.	182.62886723907278
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded.	305.0446564008898
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	112.28222358087218
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	261.3517960342706
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	78.93779949409793
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.	557.3583786012272
_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united." Mrs.	282.0347642643547
But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	869.3666888825691
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	305.0810669799629
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful.	802.1297724863251
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	169.4867917175366
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard." "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!" "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty." This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	571.9095398279699
"I am sorry it went off.	161.32081875231793
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	550.1661411663389
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	636.280464436914
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	97.96576108864217
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters.	390.1921966160589
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of." "I do not think we were speaking at all.	151.44961522978807
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	603.2852625398551
But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.	419.1686536055251
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	803.1483169195238
Could there be finer symptoms?	441.81064270996546
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this." CHAPTER VI.	436.5523296259359
You take delight in vexing me.	332.73324676373085
And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them?	1260.9358757265068
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	340.4306451500684
She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said, was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.	495.72948989700575
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	333.0622005095739
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal." "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.	114.31806998584379
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said, "Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding your's.	283.1995897126486
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.	386.1616055587579
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy.	513.824734610337
She really looked almost wild." "She did indeed, Louisa.	190.5830132334954
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.	109.19111898425183
I will only add, God bless you.	386.53280432423975
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	231.93621458288231
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	93.33744903857192
Oh! here comes Hill.	304.3865521175247
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	303.80993803024575
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	782.207820858086
He did not leave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.	366.1468935230543
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	129.42477877400665
My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him.	50.834552769971374
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.	909.6785300623208
which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.	583.588194121631
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	469.8090905724737
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	124.02539111647609
"MY DEAR BROTHER, "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	454.69345807978
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it?	364.8921109699434
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	321.00236923271063
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.	1847.833893893263
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	351.4756494304049
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.	656.8182099673902
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	454.6830511256572
But Mrs.	18.97023906303445
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	209.60346702804742
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "Just as you please." "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "Take whatever you like, and get away." Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	496.7949863586409
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	403.65071912292024
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.	125.42458902295414
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	541.0489463613214
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood." Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.	918.0068914835456
The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.	658.6466652770342
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	209.69046749921537
But think no more of the letter.	20.83719769856613
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.	1789.125372637113
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	172.9259107573315
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	408.5235174365346
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.	138.83459607919724
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	569.8249816587172
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	515.322770690464
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse." It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	178.0654753503271
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.	434.95654019737
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last.	254.04160064725954
I am very, very sorry.	118.45790026326401
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible.	696.7147671413555
She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when.	199.3614760640817
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow, their going was deferred.	962.5801985208367
PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	5.729393717094022
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	821.4155684341165
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	403.07539112232763
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	446.47574431306253
I hate such false friends.	306.04635346407935
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone." "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	207.86646529120867
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds." Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	641.707317508803
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	100.2517334437578
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	562.454831699202
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	373.5588666421037
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's." "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him." "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	296.3394336629808
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	297.8102886502537
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	211.30259511232438
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	433.5727777020999
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	522.1458109992254
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	507.00896137429254
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	343.04278615677026
After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.	794.4894569973054
Let Wickham be _your_ man.	274.04186154226966
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.	196.55053009344346
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	413.79389657110846
Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard.	694.6755380930834
This, she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better.	194.63862451026208
When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.	877.8158282669524
We now come to the point.	49.38717410028022
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding, "I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.	472.47417304209887
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	650.21995515454
The express was sent off directly.	78.80447243917511
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice." "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	582.3707046744762
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.	188.96529453362413
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	672.3117131888463
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	629.7493755365689
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity, "Miss Elizabeth Bennet." "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.	329.09010864954394
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	560.6155725370286
From their infancy, they have been intended for each other.	297.20557644161494
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	92.89566619885007
_She_ will not be able to help calling." "She will drop the acquaintance entirely." But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	369.65113914202743
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	568.7088140731253
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	297.61353769266543
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character." "Not as you represent it.	182.63690606650894
Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing, concern.	605.8795525001868
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	177.9514629633761
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	470.4427131628214
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	460.88999037321105
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	52.03803825592071
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	1156.3790594505836
She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject, seemed to justify her.	264.82246076104093
He has heartily forgiven me now." Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.	407.7777042135846
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.	755.8933203778175
who attended to you?	191.01459073816278
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers." "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?" He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	484.5388639275236
I must beg to return to the house." And she rose as she spoke.	317.17880168784063
There could not exist in the world _two_ men, over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence.	1011.8761476118336
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	547.2301609065789
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	459.0489786999115
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	993.1572428466033
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds.	254.0837584324997
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.	780.4621434430385
Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?" "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible." "It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason.	169.98064244586269
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	233.69585677636755
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	294.32182851841173
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	693.7108629902284
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.	588.1167508020606
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	338.37023489206865
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	260.83181845721845
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	1652.0085874117838
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.	616.2542398913973
They were in ---- street.	173.050802586332
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	806.9858588124359
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	508.91042903161866
END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.	123.3117741697693
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	549.2649052322088
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	668.9416363181485
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	821.2447599432583
At length however Mrs.	111.79937114910652
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.	343.6600402089917
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown.	1167.2268474585367
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not." Mrs.	174.3552139412323
Wickham is safe." "And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune." "She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him." "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.	257.0155028635999
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.	110.89423495952104
It became her turn to listen.	525.9921632994337
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	678.7249145870462
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson." "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	488.0641144729205
He still loves me, and we are engaged." Jane looked at her doubtingly.	417.8402358689176
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	510.70174275623066
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.	84.00964157782153
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	543.3249534765212
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible.	1495.7087242262935
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	382.6200087959606
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	643.8287212363264
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	562.9885248602518
Now what have you to say?" "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me." Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	329.1858614648532
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	651.8606667733519
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	361.184802402024
It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.	410.8336175487015
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	382.22784357157497
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	199.64243830888228
That lady I suppose is your mother." Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	374.568202309974
You had much better dance." "I certainly shall not.	210.36550452023567
But Georgiana would not join her.	305.61026189402276
She answered him with cold civility.	224.7594846057441
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	144.41603540146502
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!" The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	502.9757607040157
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs.	307.5553752229416
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	806.0400331147764
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	398.67688716981473
Bennet, "I am quite delighted with him.	13.828001841577963
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society." "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever." "Yes, indeed," cried Mrs.	283.9143558464015
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	475.89155269147955
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	237.1960124263104
CHAPTER XI.	45.09363045435656
She was ashamed to think how much.	139.58712174571795
The other is Miss De Bourgh.	72.44584995793215
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.	1251.1965266921914
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	254.42873327916035
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	1233.0991170396944
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	388.8841778361965
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.	930.7897189592594
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	452.77264981530163
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	1052.6151094368588
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	753.4924208193414
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	384.579477112564
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	622.1001541301024
I will try again.	90.06245167167295
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced.	1200.6534252415481
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point." "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know." "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.	366.0076788062042
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	1576.9298741169584
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	697.9144993383159
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	1164.401813612099
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	132.09422572403886

It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.	350.55760836066537
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	246.57383505907003
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	279.4035015589216
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	1040.2207726687127
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.	549.8974425695217
But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance." "Indeed!" cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her.	311.66937356676124
She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance.	574.2503913439383
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that corps.	846.8996755899874
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance." "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.	287.5399020022663
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	24.584650597743995
You see how continually we are engaged there.	623.1863236829582
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." "If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	409.39275099055124
Nothing could console and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her resentment.	841.7638937816939
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	879.3330233679746
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	1261.052791747633
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!" "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	180.04868265951396
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	1077.1696889129073
Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.	1292.6830118838825
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.	625.2459277781802
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	112.70971995682598
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	358.74960461086994
Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States.	158.81173726317806
I write rather slowly." "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!" "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours." "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her." "I have already told her so once, by your desire." "I am afraid you do not like your pen.	389.16259316702644
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	405.19450555083057
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.	58.10741475940064
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?	251.7255308370319
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	970.4350923438014

Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "I did not know before that you ever walked this way." "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	325.5223280186874
But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	874.4610532550616
What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.	527.6691832340501
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	185.37221216193154
My feelings in every respect forbid it.	81.92934079388354

But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs.	40.998336443476006
His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips.	584.6739173824989
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.	196.4660476372468
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event." "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	640.5302067126952
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	266.2275978313908
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	161.6368456538874
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	125.69174293484697
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	451.3975605027899
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	926.6891755454792
The vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	383.71888286505765
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	569.1720072327906
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	287.28751640780536
"I am trying to make it out." "And what is your success?" She shook her head.	74.0748131488521
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	725.7705846014574
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	295.8720678324156
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	620.5375795042819
But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane.	295.2636390177419
I do not believe she often sees such at home." "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	159.31323226691367
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London." "Perfectly so--I thank you." She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?" "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	180.04216375857916
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	132.40444467098226
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	812.294614035099
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	685.2959751106026
If _he_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.	667.2941666010865
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	253.61927859040665
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	241.38403958759554
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	711.3350640663712
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	181.67958663086247
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	241.14222743218878
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	211.05160915796273
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	527.7479084929123
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is." "Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	143.22124730145993
That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings.	389.57250188484977
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	285.232811270168
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	607.4146978680158
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	292.1250627729699
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain." "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life." Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	460.2212922469583
You have liked many a stupider person." "Dear Lizzy!" "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	648.9118920832802
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	889.7116306710485
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	764.6143992884537
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	630.6865390640705
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.	286.4954172098366
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.	229.5081635623625
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	114.9127471340244
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.	18.780073353686316
I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with.	719.5102973319072
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	225.1336609463256
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	379.9736359046412
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	378.5492468849377
One must speak a little, you know.	129.47822879275842
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	115.45813174518524
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	1000.6544920299191
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them, in their hours of freedom.	214.32463922209382
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	153.41461937178565
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old." This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	498.90411463374863
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	517.168295387469
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there, recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued together, were some of the most uncomfortable of her life.	857.2342149596548
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	246.26585296830632
But she would not be secure.	72.19242372698686
It is impossible that he should still love me." After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	726.5564150391168
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	251.128057753626
Long has promised to introduce him." "I do not believe Mrs.	63.816404500963095
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	133.4233488173
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose.	429.73703687532577
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	976.6053275511052
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	500.20458468219243
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts." Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	524.0021559098683
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	180.41640732779553
I am very glad you liked her.	67.36716484791054
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs.	116.54210436168613
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	908.6602437878834
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	533.2377585460425
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	385.5661065936401
Long and the Gouldings soon.	314.1223340984054
CHAPTER I.	54.138442731780366
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	156.01782076252613
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
'Ah! Mrs.	111.79937114910652
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	126.62789426638643
Their table was superlatively stupid.	304.3865521175247
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	93.87584764655819
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	411.72530726946854
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously." Mrs.	426.6674456237054
Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia," said she, "though I am _not_ her particular friend.	123.56474755907453
GARDINER." "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	38.316169544194835
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	268.98963311272985
My poor father! how he must have felt it!" "I never saw any one so shocked.	251.6253520687935
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	352.61979612387654
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.	390.88881252491035
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	706.4580432993044
His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	546.1853651054645
Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour, was sharpened into particular resentment, by his having slighted one of her daughters.	777.9083243778998
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	831.3776704093979
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour." "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	186.1210882574206
You must learn some of my philosophy.	535.9780690297955
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	170.47654104639656
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	362.31810130305814
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	692.6485716493603
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	799.4957898595195
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	566.1567118763253
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs.	38.05214274526228
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	187.7148603746998
Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.	432.8530273883896
But you are always giving _her_ the preference." "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." "Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	315.3347383573423
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	281.79253386361637
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	257.7992898104656
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	206.76627584842862
Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces.	954.0909532285499
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	212.1447611959693
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	258.9607590808917
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	134.82390254009937
Your sister I also watched.--Her look and manners were open, cheerful and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been in an error.	857.7227611603612
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	269.2624847350531
You see on what a footing we are.	667.9145639389479
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class." Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	814.3476879787631
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	501.4148476323908
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before." "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	473.2333160664645
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter." Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	1036.4901932342805
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	215.09631480232548
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	235.22462091065117
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	387.04095241825803
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	204.16055422255093
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	95.09969341888986
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	83.10123007766441
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	104.17441246511392
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.	241.04382449658317
Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch.	394.03391957961514
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	150.94741578352537
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	752.9149049737075
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	1004.668025824183
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	532.311747881214
A few weeks, he believed.	189.790966444914
Bennet.	9.8240657223746
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	50.34108456853248
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	6.875229789506248
But our visitor was very obstinate.	418.4502560218381
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	591.3616567999584
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	471.88032471314557
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	486.0402739042431
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal." "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us." Mrs.	97.06669349327603
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	1007.2848503683615
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.	654.835331764571
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them." The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	536.1796211543015
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	367.9232557186882
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth, "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	575.2402034969764
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	96.78816958870533
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	496.10056674024
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least." "Ah! you do not know what I suffer." "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood." "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them." "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all." Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	324.82632770403296
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	634.7474105710943
His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend.	875.9887347747614
It was all pride and insolence.	199.59555627205435
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.	130.44613837558353
CHAPTER XVII.	45.09363045435656
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	427.23737566437836
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	471.3109674326579
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know." Elizabeth was distressed.	125.31700648260714
Does she live near you, sir?" "The garden in which stands my humble abode, is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence." "I think you said she was a widow, sir?	410.23329333520877
But what is that to me?	121.27929257593475
Mr. and Mrs.	3.300253342876876
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	531.578760600933
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	409.53976145266796
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street." She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	141.38064825063913
We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome.	1323.2576203363926
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	604.3500926747166
Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor.	917.5307358748854
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	290.9059824798374
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham.	67.9756070667282
After lamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.	654.2903476671019
You have delighted us long enough.	214.51006088609006
Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.	704.8342926678584
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	420.61841209892594
I enquired after their brother, of course.	120.29028653844667
Mrs.	3.21889082568023
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	821.8708005908169
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	191.3854160195396
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	621.6465494099562
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	202.9435352832207
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	342.18058883648877
It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view." "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.	140.0810486009526
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	294.7108416088334
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	235.4291484759288
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.	323.0405668275562
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	241.14772038951088
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	267.12191752924497
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	663.7045924301785
If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.	396.7026310357269
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	1324.1276828030316
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	140.28563350365818
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	1121.9673935888902
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	796.1259868833903
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	1116.5659152084481
