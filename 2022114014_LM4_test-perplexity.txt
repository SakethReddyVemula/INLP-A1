Sympathetic listener.	71.34055549797608
On another star.	287.4536929971457
Four omnipotent sovereigns.	250.24297436021635
Something with a bite in it.	22.24157220117498
Lovemaking damages.	106.3408725135071
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.	1216.7774182903847
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe, grey.	607.3847134221534
Might just walk into her here.	586.9019943023707
_(Hoarsely.)_ Woman, it’s breaking me! _(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely’s sandwichboards, shuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left.	871.1950653578086
Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease.	1952.8023955529807

In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.	583.5390405529872
Messer Brunetto, I thank thee for the word.	257.7370045379291
Better buy one.	26.3246972124221
Yes.	13.686518128916221
Sure thing.	63.23066110432999
Why?	25.542540807080652
Taking what belongs to us by right.	803.0488624389922
J.	7.468684239892983
One and four into twenty: fifteen about.	1100.7412491228004
Father Conmee read in secret _Pater_ and _Ave_ and crossed his breast.	1182.754204808057
THE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide.	394.19361867143084
Wail, Banba, with your wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.	3233.1768372423285
God speed.	71.34055549797608
he asked over the fringe of his newspaper.	598.8178714461004
BLOOM: Night.	217.8491622901837
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.	1201.7281918420654
No, ants too.	228.0748401171041
And then laughed more.	286.9111203571986
Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in.	753.1643564901494
Must be his deathday.	339.2817667714711
Lydia, admired, admired.	734.7208718693033
Tell him a tale of woe about arrears of rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tears on the bench.	1245.1958891677139
Longworth will give it a good puff in the _Express._ O, will he?	365.0030056586952
Might be settling my braces.	734.7208718693033
That was to say he had heard the name of.	203.54659544926344
His pace slackened.	181.83224770904764
A gallant scene in truth it made.	1237.4895370835095
Can’t see it.	7.342298701033366
All waited.	96.08982546882402
Horn.	15.000732008649058
B.	12.771270403540324
He went on by la maison Claire.	479.588312861872
FIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?	284.0985484237611
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.	2121.3578982864037
Always find out this equal to that.	146.9543907779182

In a hurry to bury.	529.7282110744584
—What’s on you, Garry?	46.17545910501327
_(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning.	950.8997512906275
Fibres of fine fine straw.	665.4540802806374

BLOOM: You mean _Photo Bits?_ THE NYMPH: I do.	207.84327423809813
p: up, she said.	26.972183817898667
—And how is that _basso profondo_, Benjamin?	657.8842088228445
What two temperaments did they individually represent?	1238.4204670029642
I am being made a scapegoat of.	372.02495782226407
—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been first a sundering.	162.69344817533863
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.	1182.484997853773
No, Richie said.	61.29658682506357
Reading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.	589.5056270706793
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun.	253.42618976152002
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquility, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P.	1811.6529268706622
All.	15.000732008649058
Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth.	138.39739762581812
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.	1372.356650638193
Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him.	1586.6493931084722
Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck and embonpoint.	2169.5894096424445
Therefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came.	2402.8240130629038
Mind your steps there.	240.4135316607382
Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in their hands.	1794.2461788120293
Could hear them all at it.	179.71976239756228
The doorway was darkened by an entering form.	1168.5545010205412
Anonymous and S.	19.76892985478875
Desolation.	15.000732008649058
Hurray! _(They cheer.)_ BLOOM: _(Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.)_ Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let’s ring all the bells in Montague street.	888.6553604930045
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain.	1433.198165685791
_(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)_ THE VOICE OF LYNCH: _(In the thicket.)_ Whew! Piping hot! THE VOICE OF ZOE: _(From the thicket.)_ Came from a hot place.	272.5980114038925
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking.	423.94056843116624
Fifteen multiplied by.	163.10906877364204
Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians.	1400.2924074222792
Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles.	109.86454397960534
_(He sighs.)_ ’Twas ever thus.	170.58305195979258
Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.	1181.24436142348
It’s the whole pie with jam in.	217.32527717692508
A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing.	2016.18716604787
And now?	59.79986717114353
True in the larger analysis.	529.7282110744584

Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision.	1325.3099790195156
Suppose there’s some connection.	369.4825195793845
Stevenson, C.	25.658207510224706
_(They move off with slow heavy tread.)_ BLOOM: _(Blows.)_ Providential you came on the scene.	524.2897838921023
It lay there now.	56.71979277240096
The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.	2169.5894096424445
That’s why.	67.71482179897613
_Encore vingt sous.	181.83224770904764
Slung her hook, she did.	708.2998494320992
And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.	2552.5137769073895
Per second per second.	23.713256258033997
From one extreme to the other.	148.54250197190638
The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted.	3022.7103096256874

He will ask for it.	104.86503694939415
At walking pace.	217.8491622901837
To. With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard.	1199.730411807398
Similarly?	32.254267488850346
And just imagine that.	228.43204680554456
