CHAPTER I.	6.87838074833214
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.	9.344202909173589
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.	9.35127834182031
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?" Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.	5.961786326723966
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs.	5.16383713235188
"Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.	10.978880020010436
"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs.	4.4817250588451465
Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week." "What is his name?" "Bingley." "Is he married or single?" "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year.	7.689254997540058
how can it affect them?" "My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them." "Is that his design in settling here?" "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes." "I see no occasion for that.	8.42609693890967
I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now.	8.862413966718613
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them.	6.042504878210851
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new comers.	7.023801928067603
Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him, if you do not." "You are over scrupulous surely.	8.149673603068576
I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy." "I desire you will do no such thing.	9.26754499506694
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good humoured as Lydia.	8.986501416108322
But you are always giving _her_ the preference." "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters." "Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?	7.88490281466503
You have no compassion on my poor nerves." "You mistake me, my dear.	8.93543551624456
I have a high respect for your nerves.	10.155018007362829
They are my old friends.	6.366831417556941
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least." "Ah! you do not know what I suffer." "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood." "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not visit them." "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all." Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.	7.9299623141915
_Her_ mind was less difficult to develope.	9.569402865244191
She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper.	8.635491045630314
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous.	10.079770513298998
He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid, she had no knowledge of it.	8.519701917797281
It was then disclosed in the following manner.	12.538832808115027
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with, "I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy." "We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit." "But you forget, mama," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs.	7.380550996188008
Long has promised to introduce him." "I do not believe Mrs.	5.183282400017611
Long will do any such thing.	6.980049447775859
She has two nieces of her own.	7.427272717265546
She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her." "No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you." Mrs.	6.723670816050104
Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.	8.940174393344924
"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves.	8.864911668469952
You tear them to pieces." "Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times them ill." "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully.	8.446716980218707
Long does not come back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself." "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_." "Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teazing?" "I honour your circumspection.	8.39115537258572
But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after all, Mrs.	6.381607261672553
Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself." The girls stared at their father.	8.259508511704544
Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!" "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he.	7.861210652444138
I cannot quite agree with you _there_.	12.079137275708025
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know, and read great books, and make extracts." Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.	8.609322453483307
"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me so before?	13.969501812651474
If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on him.	8.621012687725216
It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now." The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.	8.125813371956962
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while.	8.805197585719652
"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last.	8.105282262046636
I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.	8.457355783631348
Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a word about it till now." "Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you chuse," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.	8.230191377248595
"I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me either, for that matter.	9.211771080560402
Not all that Mrs.	3.988971657656043
Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.	7.825413380991848
Her report was highly favourable.	8.077727567530099
Sir William had been delighted with him.	7.151444338372197
Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.	8.751806359024194
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs.	6.297511305139014
Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for." In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library.	9.183166781317997
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.	6.586970476704651
Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.	6.3908933819865625
Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation, &c.	8.875040405631296
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be.	8.413241868697053
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.	8.031111482308365
And when the party entered the assembly room, it consisted of only five altogether; Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.	8.368460560545815
Mr. Bingley was good looking and gentleman-like; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners.	7.763448189249474
His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion.	7.063944125844246
His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.	7.040500891181735
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.	8.067171653696363
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.	8.64742884845816
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves.	5.879180101713271
What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs.	6.845265570884508
His character was decided.	7.740652576594118
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs.	4.962677595429173
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.	8.215742373714875
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance.	5.740964556244954
You had much better dance." "I certainly shall not.	7.029185898912755
You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner.	10.325804482033913
At such an assembly as this, it would be insupportable.	11.071129538753382
Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room, whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with." "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life, as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty." "_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.	7.993262076437636
"Oh! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say, very agreeable.	8.568320413454732
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me." Mr. Bingley followed his advice.	7.925377740977493
Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.	7.851375981033136
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in any thing ridiculous.	8.648686727703746
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.	6.927504306508339
Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.	9.55021899288155
Jane was as much gratified by this, as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.	8.582091349205312
Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure.	8.6234249373647
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball.	8.92919755213043
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants.	7.919888734386071
They found Mr. Bennet still up.	8.775520909667783
With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.	9.823268690479065
He had rather hoped that all his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear.	11.840295867314495
I wish you had been there.	7.6899385481467855
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.	6.987227677007516
Every body said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice.	8.392220760970403
Only think of _that_ my dear; he actually danced with her twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time.	8.220743127685868
First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.	7.845376882099033
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all: indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.	9.23189286374837
So, he enquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next.	10.68500542223484
Oh! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!" "Oh! my dear," continued Mrs.	7.130323927022805
He is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women.	10.252648479823058
I dare say the lace upon Mrs.	3.546700106912672
Hurst's gown----" Here she was interrupted again.	9.115711616221102
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.	7.103586538300562
"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing.	7.202119179766431
I quite detest the man." CHAPTER IV.	7.158503035956053
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him.	7.272625199376538
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!" "He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can.	7.907355722143764
His character is thereby complete." "I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.	7.6258896574409185
I did not expect such a compliment." "Did not you?	10.555380781714973
_I_ did for you.	3.8133465641551765
But that is one great difference between us.	7.014522178601215
What could be more natural than his asking you again?	10.990335116775267
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room.	7.337465121228642
Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.	8.301137379215517
You have liked many a stupider person." "Dear Lizzy!" "Oh! you are a great deal too apt you know, to like people in general.	8.313352490588018
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life." "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always speak what I think." "I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder.	7.832462154097127
With _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where.	6.474915805908394
But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of every body's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone.	8.939042843965074
Their manners are not equal to his." "Certainly not; at first.	7.467844358357905
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them.	7.868413420623386
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her." Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them.	7.752498518922486
They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.	10.307136931665474
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.	7.792938953652246
They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.	9.73092430496743
Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.--Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.	9.300857983690207
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.	7.493844951319518
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House.	8.88374733725129
He did look at it and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.	8.47810120775315
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character.--Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied.	7.565723804825568
In understanding Darcy was the superior.	8.132234782717155
Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever.	9.536725043522265
He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting.	8.774756929624122
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage.	6.596585596722131
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offence.	8.691975504130236
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure.	8.217186789516207
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.	7.6991701669234365
Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of.	8.029490197756973
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose.	9.155271849732559
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King, during his mayoralty.	8.876513465240413
For though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to every body.	7.9832990260209264
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs.	6.668653109656626
Bennet.--They had several children.	9.905621436618928
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.	7.567513141964283
"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs.	5.720704569564706
Bennet with civil self-command to Miss Lucas.	7.5756676581684355
"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice." "Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better." "Oh!--you mean Jane, I suppose--because he danced with her twice.	7.9536408279131745
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he _did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something about Mr. Robinson." "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you?	8.27419245401195
Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest?	10.947067942758105
and his answering immediately to the last question--Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt, there cannot be two opinions on that point." "Upon my word!--Well, that was very decided indeed--that does seem as if----but however, it may all come to nothing you know." "_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said Charlotte.	8.083951278475555
Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips." "Are you quite sure, Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her." "Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to." "Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance.	7.886233225916269
With _them_ he is remarkably agreeable." "I do not believe a word of it, my dear.	6.2763946145844205
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs.	7.864578648344302
Long.	14.848096511074402
Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise." "I do not mind his not talking to Mrs.	6.696696611829676
Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza." "Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_, if I were you." "I believe, Ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him." "His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it.	7.100797038547076
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, every thing in his favour, should think highly of himself.	7.580152131047815
By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary.	8.780822215419569
Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously.	7.047651060815481
A person may be proud without being vain.	9.611205638607567
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us." "If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was.	7.0794738728818025
I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day." "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.	6.7698620488293315
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly." The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.	8.043410836305778
CHAPTER VI.	7.155281002419743
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield.	6.316948480177542
The visit was returned in due form.	6.593376201412895
Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs.	6.845674811409172
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with _them_, was expressed towards the two eldest.	10.15548555184159
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her; and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent.	9.124559805054407
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.	7.482682084438725
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark.	9.15553261884746
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself.	7.519083735920601
We can all _begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.	8.537568129787509
In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better shew _more_ affection than she feels.	8.590467075092239
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on." "But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow.	8.989242713789325
If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too." "Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do." "But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out." "Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her.	7.625500285802329
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together.	7.98412519392566
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention.	7.0779645724862466
When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses." "Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it.	8.589159815766596
But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design.	9.741634889720173
As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its reasonableness.	9.793374958646933
She has known him only a fortnight.	9.580759804029858
She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined in company with him four times.	9.381795086185127
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character." "Not as you represent it.	7.561342713033139
Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal." "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded." "Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.	7.935752853496575
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.	6.705284053110063
If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or ever so similar before-hand, it does not advance their felicity in the least.	8.593249490419314
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life." "You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound.	7.333358443881743
You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself." Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend.	9.12904115776476
Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise.	10.62385903838208
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.	9.122667414073973
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness.	9.873361046920635
Of this she was perfectly unaware;--to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.	7.74033440297205
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others.	8.099309307686605
It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.	9.377835275756869
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?" "That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer." "But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about.	8.661713214294512
He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him." On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him, which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said, "Did not you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?" "With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic." "You are severe on us." "It will be _her_ turn soon to be teazed," said Miss Lucas.	7.889961063574971
"I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows." "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable, but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well; if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song." Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital.	8.025558958042005
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.	8.351573745903265
Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.	7.4639314060516435
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies." "Certainly, Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance." Sir William only smiled.	7.41492939435137
"Your friend performs delightfully;" he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy." "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, Sir." "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight.	7.02407818208458
Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.	10.57552767159911
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half hour." "Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.	7.669858000471995
"He is indeed--but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a partner?" Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away.	9.162234440597594
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley, "I can guess the subject of your reverie." "I should imagine not." "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.	8.548048770315505
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity and yet the noise; the nothingness and yet the self-importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them!" "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you.	6.992614103810243
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity, "Miss Elizabeth Bennet." "Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley.	8.60097390799906
A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.	8.337736974798695
You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you." He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to entertain herself in this manner, and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.	7.667659332094024
CHAPTER VII.	7.918620115753125
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.	7.6087857888610495
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.	6.740251516420068
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way.	8.156330348343479
The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt.	6.885320919698548
At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head quarters.	8.775942490763258
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections.	8.35906921759121
Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves.	7.792026739922961
Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before.	7.630138300243845
They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.	9.320361536393921
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed, "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country.	8.809242322722566
I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced." Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.	7.814653301089266
Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly.	10.590688485081479
If I wished to think slightingly of any body's children, it should not be of my own however." "If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it." "Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever." "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree.	9.377316176986348
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish." "My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.	8.140922430261199
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and indeed so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals." "Mama," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library." Mrs.	7.912994230740266
Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, "Well, Jane, who is it from?	9.271812575794957
what does he say?	7.531926427798096
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love." "It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.	7.876288421133306
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this.	7.957166469430307
Yours ever, "CAROLINE BINGLEY." "With the officers!" cried Lydia.	8.093303333083924
"I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_." "Dining out," said Mrs.	8.099987280909424
Bennet, "that is very unlucky." "Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.	8.384639062541986
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night." "That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home." "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs." "I had much rather go in the coach." "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.	7.662038937828812
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?" "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them." "But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered." She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged.	8.669282652788663
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day.	8.485101547510958
Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted.	7.8116798959254945
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.	7.8850194604170225
Bennet, more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own.	8.099819204082115
Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance.	9.293618898979451
They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and excepting a sore-throat and head-ache there is not much the matter with me.	7.618573669090881
"Yours, &c." "Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness, if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders." "Oh! I am not at all afraid of her dying.	7.047860776902133
People do not die of little trifling colds.	10.13467229331452
She will be taken good care of.	7.84492083311288
As long as she stays there, it is all very well.	7.354567207643291
I would go and see her, if I could have the carriage." Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horse-woman, walking was her only alternative.	7.1832098334101495
She declared her resolution.	7.270827124450202
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there." "I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want." "Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?" "No, indeed.	7.669739283450134
I do not wish to avoid the walk.	9.30561327601163
The distance is nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles.	6.693598153769279
I shall be back by dinner." "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required." "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.--Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.	7.400289983057516
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes." In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.	7.491738487696895
Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it.	7.434265282787348
She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.--Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.	7.819127705005153
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone.	8.839785687139663
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.	9.275964486376921
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered.	9.11388823116814
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room.	8.281650959276373
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance.	10.301919858345833
She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with.	8.418194103771647
Elizabeth silently attended her.	3.723653295193185
When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane.	8.449556932660293
The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts.	7.827835747011157
The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely.	7.356661178124259
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere.	9.317458064713948
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go; and very unwillingly said so.	7.912757377121415
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.	6.046298209401405
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner.	6.352343258715054
To the civil enquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer.	6.2269851435057575
Jane was by no means better.	7.558658771688721
The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.	8.703163991431898
His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others.	8.831296771015923
She had very little notice from any but him.	6.469920399117488
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.	7.2199885047111705
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room.	7.0912658285774395
She really looked almost wild." "She did indeed, Louisa.	7.314087769652898
I could hardly keep my countenance.	10.274439003709515
Her hair so untidy, so blowsy!" "Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it, not doing its office." "Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me.	7.171797908443325
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well, when she came into the room this morning.	8.392341937731654
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice." "_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such an exhibition." "Certainly not." "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by it?	7.538313651528612
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country town indifference to decorum." "It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.	7.562143839108594
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes." "Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."--A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs.	6.571297949618555
Hurst began again.	4.230842006293258
"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.	8.898691788274027
But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it." "I think I have heard you say, that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton." "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside." "That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.	7.857093876971918
"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable." "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.	7.519942835745514
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.	8.8263531780136
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.	8.07496673689187
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.	8.480772950367147
On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book.	8.32892891175443
Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.	12.014964586503952
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular." "Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards.	7.468239230310956
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else." "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things." "In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well." Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying.	8.674828363657353
He immediately offered to fetch her others; all that his library afforded.	7.712171334234728
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever look into." Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.	7.881599672408107
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!" "It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations." "And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books." "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these." "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place.	7.889649069124135
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?" "I think she will.	7.415646163158051
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller." "How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much.	8.349447093698476
Such a countenance, such manners! and so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the piano-forte is exquisite." "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished, as they all are." "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?" "Yes, all of them, I think.	7.942030427502688
They all paint tables, cover skreens and net purses.	4.73063956727786
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished." "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth.	8.525343511524719
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.	9.510171285598279
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half deserved." "All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading." "I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.	7.267636687078019
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_." "Are you so severe upon your own sex, as to doubt the possibility of all this?" "_I_ never saw such a woman.	8.80835163358043
As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.	6.253591800638764
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable." Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.	6.942702403285009
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her.	7.211281241257449
Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.	8.333080433342861
Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable.	14.50433235270874
They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.	7.396319919827213
CHAPTER IX.	7.155281002419743
In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgment of her situation.	8.828206524616888
Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.	11.680844922419787
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs.	5.592029818964258
Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.	8.564580678311481
After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour.	8.222233608191658
Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.	10.363691684611151
"She is a great deal too ill to be moved.	12.15671759515443
Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her.	8.916837398703091
"It must not be thought of.	8.370710231050332
My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal." "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us." Mrs.	7.171653654046739
Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.	14.64214141708278
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_.	8.51738439355495
You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.	6.874865706624944
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.	8.306864093822563
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope, though you have but a short lease." "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes.	8.78354736590626
At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here." "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.	6.910543177067924
"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly." "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful." "That is as it happens.	8.46263070774741
It must be an amusing study." "Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing.	8.202446134166667
They have at least that advantage." "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few subjects for such a study.	7.556109651284787
Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.	10.962853684086925
"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town." Every body was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away.	9.136146909219438
Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.	10.325854647006388
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part, except the shops and public places.	7.966937328495932
They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either." "Aye--that is because you have the right disposition.	8.454016475351118
But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all." "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother.	7.449375311701872
"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy.	5.859149900220955
I know we dine with four and twenty families." Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance.	8.761130077338176
His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile.	8.68964067820844
Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.	8.433000564779777
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father.	8.234763429038313
What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he?	6.986200547002966
For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently.	6.948713572057031
Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty.	9.367108508221877
I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see any body better looking.	10.226283031019436
It is what every body says.	14.039755825120256
I do not trust my own partiality.	15.218243831930389
When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner's in town, so much in love with her, that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.	7.16293744935762
But however he did not.	4.5717377914607695
Perhaps he thought her too young.	10.011781995176872
Every thing nourishes what is strong already.	8.737729988928743
But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away." Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again.	7.413606944677159
She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.	6.571884134890952
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy.	6.238663720910197
Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required.	9.108932752397857
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs.	4.468692542214761
Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward.	9.447588590234382
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.	8.077078488609681
She was very equal therefore to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.	8.245729010919064
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.	10.070297596380849
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill." Lydia declared herself satisfied.	9.568486333610126
"Oh! yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.	7.394518593378233
And when you have given _your_ ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also.	8.954153798315549
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not." Mrs.	6.771704251646938
The day passed much as the day before had done.	7.145771621257652
Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room.	8.413716992841447
The loo table, however, did not appear.	8.706497311582563
Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.	6.571906416267153
Hurst was observing their game.	7.125023920150653
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion.	8.173007602456925
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.	8.223779051768537
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!" He made no answer.	9.76645996336107
I write rather slowly." "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year! Letters of business too! How odious I should think them!" "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours." "Pray tell your sister that I long to see her." "I have already told her so once, by your desire." "I am afraid you do not like your pen.	7.914306917927106
Let me mend it for you.	5.699261188336714
I mend pens remarkably well." "Thank you--but I always mend my own." "How can you contrive to write so even?" He was silent.	7.481753286597698
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp, and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's." "Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice." "Oh! it is of no consequence.	8.508379345234305
It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." "And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?" "The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting.	7.520590791019514
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance.	9.174447093233614
When you told Mrs.	4.0559749225287085
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?" "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning.	8.597770638989786
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and, at another word, might stay a month." "You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition.	7.462238779752012
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself." "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper.	8.691169492616213
Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety." "To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit with you." "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either." "You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection.	7.509326932522166
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it.	6.087356930458877
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley.	9.58096226301539
We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon.	8.202204167033198
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference.	10.535916498599736
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do." Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended; and therefore checked her laugh.	8.745164480099115
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.	8.765119956527498
Arguments are too much like disputes.	11.303556257820643
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me." "What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter." Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.	7.017895245377008
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music.	9.53174572546768
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano-forte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.	7.267605810262539
Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.	8.007452612246206
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange.	9.343872116435715
She could only imagine however at last, that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present.	7.596910543965386
The supposition did not pain her.	5.675925760732318
She liked him too little to care for his approbation.	10.402335588190523
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her-- "Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?" She smiled, but made no answer.	7.666753707005267
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply.	7.759926405527394
You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt.	7.904554563705526
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare." "Indeed I do not dare." Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.	8.23839534442848
He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.	9.198929140747964
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane, received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.	9.157667850074667
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.	9.508031450467497
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses." "Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity?" "Oh! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley.	7.463336671725708
They are in the same profession, you know; only in different lines.	8.922183793069134
As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?" "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eye-lashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied." At that moment they were met from another walk, by Mrs.	7.621962445801061
Hurst and Elizabeth herself.	7.58353000558716
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.	10.61002204601575
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs.	6.261057394012034
Hurst, "in running away without telling us that you were coming out." Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself.	6.666549272989474
The path just admitted three.	7.089341103573375
Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said,-- "This walk is not wide enough for our party.	8.637174637373224
We had better go into the avenue." But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered, "No, no; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd, and appear to uncommon advantage.	7.5398093868807035
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth.	7.928294089980863
Good bye." She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two.	8.71597829182841
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.	8.627666391614683
Their powers of conversation were considerable.	7.380284102578734
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object.	8.981396033177694
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps.	10.092268580569275
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.	7.866878949289903
He was full of joy and attention.	7.7351416608551835
He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to any one else.	8.669273280350565
Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.	9.461604246302777
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table--but in vain.	6.591442180808505
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected.	8.112752871754088
Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep.	8.602110760241645
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs.	5.55865268990461
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page.	9.128526884052222
She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said, "By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure." "If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chuses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards." "I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.	8.263227535601628
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day." "Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball." Miss Bingley made no answer; and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room.	8.094972743970372
Her figure was elegant, and she walked well;--but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious.	8.182950826631446
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more; and, turning to Elizabeth, said, "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude." Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately.	8.132727126778377
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.	10.885396464611418
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book.	8.79890636581361
"What could he mean?	11.15561633670643
she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?	9.427726308297087
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him, will be to ask nothing about it." Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in any thing, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.	7.927700788559378
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak.	7.240792600601729
"I never heard any thing so abominable.	11.81443124834277
How shall we punish him for such a speech?" "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth.	7.500966636535054
"We can all plague and punish one another.	6.048763503636827
Teaze him--laugh at him.--Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done." "But upon my honour I do _not_.	9.449987657192784
I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _that_.	10.792719148424728
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no--I feel he may defy us there.	6.322155439619912
And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject.	9.009450930182417
Mr. Darcy may hug himself." "Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth.	6.69005655621344
"That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance.	8.8632656165377
I dearly love a laugh." "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be.	6.032487877170023
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.	8.608684882928248
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies _do_ divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without." "Perhaps that is not possible for any one.	6.660103132404198
But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation." Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.	7.718320028547202
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;--"and pray what is the result?" "I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect.	8.415115345035845
He owns it himself without disguise." "No"--said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension.	6.887667511838788
I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding.	9.233682627724603
My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding--certainly too little for the convenience of the world.	7.704587028144781
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them.	6.704460980471795
My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever." "_That_ is a failing indeed!"--cried Elizabeth.	6.946913330609797
You are safe from me." "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome." "And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate every body." "And yours," he replied with a smile, "is wilfully to misunderstand them." "Do let us have a little music,"--cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share.--"Louisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst." Her sister made not the smallest objection, and the piano-forte was opened, and Darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for it.	7.260349455535449
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.	7.854054601820057
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day.	8.693785868541806
Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before.	10.508257837531458
Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home.	8.570313733716318
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.--Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.	8.843871846850666
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.	9.147064630328643
She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teazing than usual to himself.	6.672609800048411
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place.	8.247558297470073
Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former.--Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits.	8.944023201417735
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother.	7.182779224369275
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again.--But their father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle.	9.306068057610121
They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature; and had some new extracts to admire, and some new observations of thread-bare morality to listen to.	5.796198553972545
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort.	10.552568612230951
CHAPTER XIII.	7.918620115753125
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in, and I hope _my_ dinners are good enough for her.	6.935504647317193
I do not believe she often sees such at home." "The person of whom I speak, is a gentleman and a stranger." Mrs.	6.71141737317289
Bennet's eyes sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure.	7.792090787691832
Why Jane--you never dropt a word of this; you sly thing! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got to-day.	6.698612512678744
I must speak to Hill, this moment." "It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life." This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.	8.464051714563176
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained.	8.811147593573947
"About a month ago I received this letter, and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention.	7.439857419408307
It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases." "Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.	8.114016284341082
Pray do not talk of that odious man.	9.257560999118798
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it." Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.	8.475708633278183
They had often attempted it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs.	6.753759244875892
I hate such false friends.	5.9295464992985325
As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate, will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch.	6.797944728505437
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends,--but of this hereafter.	8.438625019088203
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'night following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.	7.499846939492556
I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend, WILLIAM COLLINS." "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter.	6.507198449870475
"He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again." "There is some sense in what he says about the girls however; and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him." "Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit." Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.	8.146900973251265
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she.	7.168779782564825
"I cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he would help it, if he could.--Can he be a sensible man, sir?" "No, my dear; I think not.	8.919072479757737
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse.	9.122701555284719
There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well.	8.338363498626835
I am impatient to see him." "In point of composition," said Mary, "his letter does not seem defective.	9.950779018986896
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed." To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting.	8.703289756801318
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.	10.426867908392913
As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure, which astonished her husband and daughters.	8.879690802502912
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.	8.832261595094142
Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.	8.053380541709977
He was a tall, heavy looking young man of five and twenty.	7.343911346066527
His air was grave and stately, and his manners were very formal.	8.151423684844877
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs.	7.038363174607577
Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage.	7.340857925094994
Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily, "You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so; for else they will be destitute enough.	8.343948911231625
Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world.	9.7389305358762
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed." "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate.	7.878164151862574
At present I will not say more, but perhaps when we are better acquainted----" He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other.	8.634369290921526
They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.	9.432456221550877
The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture were examined and praised; and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs.	6.793387105831738
Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.	10.739136449793879
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins, the excellence of its cookery was owing.	7.65792841275054
But here he was set right by Mrs.	5.079239619833505
Bennet, who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.	11.658011117071283
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.	8.069673843171824
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.	9.672054577258502
Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable.	9.317330494898616
Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better.	10.037605187908117
Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.	11.92816946297597
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses, which he had already had the honour of preaching before her.	7.207557850707358
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening.	7.522112078384259
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen any thing but affability in her.	6.463761831763442
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage; where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets up stairs.	8.124244333965489
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs.	4.852440853457093
Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman.	8.664388059452742
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her.	7.420565382385103
has she any family?" "She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property." "Ah!" cried Mrs.	6.023187091978395
Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls.	9.068762462941047
And what sort of young lady is she?	10.620205443324107
is she handsome?" "She is a most charming young lady indeed.	9.073964635637497
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty, Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth.	9.329414623881668
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay." "You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.	7.059163393390342
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.	8.185291454324043
By tea-time however the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.	8.042997618289814
Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but on beholding it, (for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library,) he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels.--Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed.--Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.	8.938113233052926
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with, "Do you know, mama, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard, and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.	6.410490834445229
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday.	9.700960504260637
But I will no longer importune my young cousin." Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon.	8.5326093465247
Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.	8.397624205412262
CHAPTER XV.	7.155281002419743
The subjection in which his father had brought him up, had given him originally great humility of manner, but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.	7.956153091015407
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.	8.280252436180623
His plan did not vary on seeing them.--Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice.	8.283736119804862
The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mrs.	6.817296814669583
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--"As to her _younger_ daughters she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her _eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged." Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs.	8.101755196423477
Bennet was stirring the fire.	9.996337710791373
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.	7.767228577557043
Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before, was now high in her good graces.	9.7444025421743
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.	7.55880751125197
Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.	8.144984042770712
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go.	8.371680153970932
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.	7.806109094315924
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.	9.360712926872756
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recal them.	7.820150387472377
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentleman-like appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way.	8.99823310883838
All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be, and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot.	8.082202807283402
Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps.	8.084720891949765
This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.	10.385628869683336
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.	9.700955103824073
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street.	6.75294796486453
Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object.	8.142497871667322
He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her.	7.012453439459755
Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.	9.495665047313016
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.	7.743654455808882
What could be the meaning of it?--It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.	7.913040271075311
In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.	6.775082919044006
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Philips's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.	8.5548943805038
Philips' throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the invitation.	8.79473395012799
Philips was always glad to see her nieces, and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.	8.50860548761154
She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice.	8.88445875975984
Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ----shire.	7.831177577484621
She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers, who in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening.	8.086709655584471
This was agreed to, and Mrs.	4.345236945452647
Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.	7.329131279593568
The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.	8.351075770171267
Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.	7.5398019651496755
CHAPTER XVI.	7.155281002419743
Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.	7.68924961190234
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.	7.7251433469488235
Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.	8.327139712726042
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs.	7.424964538677903
Philips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could.	8.293102941479454
It was over at last however.	13.476613504354031
The gentlemen did approach; and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.	9.668273309946272
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable, gentleman-like set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.	7.501411888435654
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most thread-bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.	8.08850677186693
With such rivals for the notice of the fair, as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs.	6.777891752027998
Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.	6.181621431527904
When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.	9.321123542282239
"I know little of the game, at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation of life----" Mrs.	7.145703980682061
Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.	11.634139601587112
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.	8.63750796643197
At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for any one in particular.	8.027694571889961
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.	8.241163911422365
She dared not even mention that gentleman.	7.751489065606547
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved.	7.2445341234942555
Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.	10.778570347476451
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand." "Yes," replied Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one.	6.726151055328106
A clear ten thousand per annum.	7.521518109940259
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy." Elizabeth could not but look surprised.	9.357533246388247
I am not qualified to form one.	8.228035838425207
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.	10.344102768740433
It is impossible for _me_ to be impartial.	16.12315650455098
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family." "Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield.	9.447281288357253
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire.	8.735532383121432
Every body is disgusted with his pride.	7.7635536189314145
You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one." "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.	8.85180265272696
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen." "I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.	7.844110064064179
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer." "I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield.	8.726830572228621
I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood." "Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.	7.602700520352005
His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections.	8.195996716869502
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father." Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry.	8.769860396487157
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.	8.98617616002736
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.	6.925674987083568
I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.	7.035460035705513
Society, I own, is necessary to me.	6.7022349058980035
I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude.	10.498552625296728
I _must_ have employment and society.	5.880386035934846
The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now." "Indeed!" "Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.	8.882632183917877
He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.	6.8853353024805
He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere." "Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?" "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law.	9.291602612812305
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short any thing or nothing.	7.187888050637231
Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it.	6.831807904993159
I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.	8.61044725824636
I can recal nothing worse.	10.905641035060306
But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me." "This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced." "Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.	8.95809917567264
Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_." Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.	8.404007827197018
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?" "A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy.	7.684045931402017
Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.	8.89129204427346
His disposition must be dreadful." "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham, "_I_ can hardly be just to him." Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"--She could have added, "A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with "And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!" "We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.	8.538987350567101
_My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property.	8.467450896846401
He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend.	6.687610765427626
Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself." "How strange!" cried Elizabeth.	7.82767636772601
But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride." "Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?" "Yes.	8.240170487886148
Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his father was, have done this.	8.665758343810365
Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive.	8.189140661460712
He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers." "What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?" He shook his head.--"I wish I could call her amiable.	7.42902081607281
But she is too much like her brother,--very, very proud.--As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.	8.174588444270686
She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and I understand highly accomplished.	8.47725665656711
He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is." "Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses.	7.2148735170513305
He does not want abilities.	11.47274106166394
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while.	8.24143899162414
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.	9.002645113184771
His pride never deserts him; but with the rich, he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure." The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs.	6.6596218688561954
Philips.--The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter.	9.698250135158991
Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy.	8.859288678600272
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card table, they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.	7.78614687500884
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters." Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.	8.006488661855101
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living.	6.934602490110339
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday." "Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates." This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.	8.96863740682812
Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another.	7.031253161340273
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class." Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions.	8.517356592273185
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs.	6.452151298149214
Philips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to every body.	10.039426662724894
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.	7.408033461707752
She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.	7.759086377583453
Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.	8.877109375285903
CHAPTER XVII.	7.155281002419743
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day, what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself.	5.831207316527077
Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained.	8.052540761197413
"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea.	6.4736575771715
It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side." "Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody." "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.	8.445523895303236
My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,--one, whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible.	7.41221858310971
No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.	7.93791530586887
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him?	8.188615136530915
oh! no." "I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.	7.379078098223425
Besides, there was truth in his looks." "It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think." "I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think." But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.	7.975398300137346
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.	9.466988118823984
To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs.	5.16889949403254
Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others.	6.551722712977679
Bennet's civilities.	17.161387550062326
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family.	7.339924972614158
Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card.	8.325625875758107
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia, depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was at any rate, a ball.	7.378661331729785
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.	6.139875428968145
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.	6.52956372616456
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body." Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.	8.3122810247388
"I am by no means of opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening, and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her." Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.	7.907439488991519
Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.	7.496578855530974
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more.--It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.	6.983125329189704
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself, by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to _her_.	8.485149217923931
Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.	6.9784113473615195
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.	7.450300001128458
No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after;--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.	7.273229079169005
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather, which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, endurable to Kitty and Lydia.	7.128677034749856
CHAPTER XVIII.	7.155281002419743
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her.	6.37010050485608
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.	6.418528169971357
She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening.	10.592939133446095
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here." This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.	8.460210513057723
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill humour, which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.	8.145723645527177
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice.	9.185413929212553
The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification.	7.313773406109349
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.	7.501678994233689
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him.	7.818192676254528
He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her.	6.889174966306494
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable." "Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil." When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence.	8.490985647729465
They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance.	8.535581529301117
He replied, and was again silent.	6.266310328060767
"Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent." "Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?" "Sometimes.	8.333113016165006
One must speak a little, you know.	5.8415667522808326
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible." "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?" "Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb." "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he.	8.525972002460367
"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly." "I must not decide on my own performance." He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton.	8.661015442814044
She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance." The effect was immediate.	7.374821343989751
At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain." "He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life." Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.	8.071789706080791
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.	7.802883254547875
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear Sir.	9.885864062034676
Such very superior dancing is not often seen.	8.440223088007954
It is evident that you belong to the first circles.	15.570505583354166
Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza, (glancing at her sister and Bingley,) shall take place.	7.753915159008618
What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me." The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.	8.491286862497391
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of." "I do not think we were speaking at all.	7.913689603389211
"Books--Oh! no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings." "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions." "No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else." "The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.	7.967212194046084
You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created_." "I am," said he, with a firm voice.	6.705000740817323
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?" "I hope not." "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first." "May I ask to what these questions tend?" "Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity.	7.646321250675996
"I am trying to make it out." "And what is your success?" She shook her head.	9.638918777351499
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly." "I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either." "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity." "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.	7.232642805293243
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.	7.8160840820167286
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her, "So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.	9.041561337693366
I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better." "His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself." "I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.	8.574267478428625
"Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant." "Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.	7.661685387759924
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley.	8.39870775214994
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.	8.452322173885587
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.	7.240998677929285
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon." "No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you.	8.07721183292766
Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.	8.141848620131192
I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard." "Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?" "No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton." "This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.	8.71543784046757
I am perfectly satisfied.	11.495533312726515
But what does he say of the living?" "He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only." "I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.	8.549634165324443
Mr. Bingley's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say, but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before." She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment.	9.00682174256069
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it.	6.810499880943407
On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.	9.394164632463076
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine.	7.2278520114332805
How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.	7.928957822128764
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology." "You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?" "Indeed I am.	7.497912637850234
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.	10.038882437384945
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.	12.806761994434643
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.	10.588992156812173
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident.	8.147803799645974
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."--It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man.	7.1557244304263925
Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility.	8.661307584875198
Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.	7.7221426645121065
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.	7.733902469540095
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception.	7.628619689438434
He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying, that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.	9.460771065546307
It was really a very handsome thought.	14.29941136582185
Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him." As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.	7.1197297314496435
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.	8.552002786380978
Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much.	7.800868849862856
When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr. Bingley.--It was an animating subject, and Mrs.	7.450028646571164
Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match.	8.086565419089743
His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do.	8.43349910239384
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.	6.897136221179674
Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life.	8.896171410050314
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.	7.0424011566760285
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.	9.337973401581282
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?	7.773676384517109
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear." "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing." Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.	8.877381153063983
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.	12.15486606445781
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation.	4.875103770773949
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.	7.894174483953843
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.	7.393898170036051
At length however Mrs.	4.192979585621781
Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.	8.42915062880564
Elizabeth now began to revive.	10.768991852517743
But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company.	6.541408119114571
By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.	7.089913295227819
Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations; and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.	8.961764366718665
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected.--Elizabeth was in agonies.	9.383184234448684
She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.	8.830057691575304
She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued however impenetrably grave.	7.2097357207213975
She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night.	6.590949446928865
He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child.	8.108837611156323
You have delighted us long enough.	7.954448288217573
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit." Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.	9.907901073124263
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.	8.261591176823762
He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.	7.949144591208015
To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed.	8.644159949149854
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.	8.499095803788498
She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy's farther notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak.	9.321909217448699
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.	6.619890393820256
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a manoeuvre of Mrs.	5.442797039265856
Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family.	9.054460600596597
Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.	6.113818137399836
Bennet at conversation, and by so doing, threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.	7.933588271947062
Darcy said nothing at all.	5.3145387454613005
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other.	9.00439717104899
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs.	3.736706627872958
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs.	5.074087672872714
Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation.	8.938797247012804
Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.	8.140210815984126
Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.	8.381533996998877
Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.	5.950759586426136
CHAPTER XIX.	7.155281002419743
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.	7.64818000733293
Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business.	8.676777885445468
On finding Mrs.	2.795741781653202
Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words, "May I hope, Madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?" Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs.	8.540830840160531
Bennet instantly answered, "Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out, "Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr. Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear.	8.405965636329737
I am going away myself." "No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."--And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added, "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins." Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.	7.730649714100395
Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began.	9.573931790203135
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.	7.6977998675131865
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother's permission for this address.	9.065429462123932
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.	8.242086373467878
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life.	7.313609054306053
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did." The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued: "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish.	7.891500594404439
Secondly, that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.	8.339109115344602
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs.	6.484103965593452
Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's foot-stool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry.	6.9104847316353455
A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly, chuse a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way.	7.077556765798413
This is my advice.	10.864781217386202
Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer.	7.753411460092295
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite.	8.29874431622033
But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father, (who, however, may live many years longer,) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.	8.317877860378934
This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.	8.72313183799197
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection.	9.046732782152937
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents.	9.163167662206627
On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married." It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.	7.446556368929864
"You are too hasty, Sir," she cried.	6.793798656346635
"You forget that I have made no answer.	9.69634146830858
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me.	7.761781144016518
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long." "Upon my word, Sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration.	7.586076647571584
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.	9.271832137662383
I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation." "Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you.	8.968289447461524
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications." "Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.	8.957474449173288
You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say.	8.224271945426585
I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.	8.268710088899475
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.	7.940557580811941
This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her, "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character." "Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly.	8.96592093832741
My situation in life, my connections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.	7.691518095275422
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.	10.601363336242851
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible.	8.037883835946026
My feelings in every respect forbid it.	5.442372302016981
Can I speak plainer?	12.41247492745616
CHAPTER XX.	9.416879382657287
Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs.	8.069230889350061
Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.	9.11717857718115
This information, however, startled Mrs.	4.722897463624887
Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so.	8.788343340874215
I will speak to her about it myself directly.	10.811350996788654
She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it." "Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.	9.331662714557465
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity." "Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs.	6.689368281372379
Bennet, alarmed.	20.175742859893056
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these.	8.030795391689175
I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure." She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.	8.876888197593033
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_." Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.	9.17831042871991
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech.	7.710745285177712
"Of what are you talking?" "Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.	7.684528533162716
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy." "And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business." "Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.	7.552803962134104
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him." "Let her be called down.	7.936632666773105
Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.	7.328957119628212
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared.	9.296857995743082
"I have sent for you on an affair of importance.	8.53278076560422
I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage.	6.940956846370602
Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.	7.136610444423967
We now come to the point.	7.035795080769169
Your mother insists upon your accepting it.	4.630473207483879
Bennet?" "Yes, or I will never see her again." "An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.	6.627211853079866
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_." Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs.	8.52104511057096
Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.	11.424109086088286
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way?	8.849380680877976
You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him." "My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.	6.496499098648192
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.	10.77663965296571
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be." Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs.	8.176665138909353
Bennet give up the point.	6.894092999573718
She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns.	6.312442456068847
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest, but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering;--and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks.	7.90599872583863
Though her manner varied however, her determination never did.	7.1305032612419
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.	8.396065360521561
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way.	7.032771630823563
His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.	9.370529306294157
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them.	8.359898022403891
"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves." Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.	7.279371380441777
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs.	4.439267910043888
Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I_ shall not be able to keep you--and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word.	7.9349552846362075
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking.	7.7625382760898685
Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so.	8.373714944312923
Those who do not complain are never pitied." Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation.	7.058551718908334
She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together." Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear.	8.121366763112224
In a doleful voice Mrs.	4.340556967694111
Bennet thus began the projected conversation.--"Oh! Mr. Collins!"-- "My dear Madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.	7.293435634344663
Far be it from me," he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter.	6.035772531322328
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned.	9.15385477630164
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.	8.180380889907894
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.	7.337707205229865
But we are all liable to error.	9.237657371040576
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.	11.447630893593873
The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.	7.712423626929556
He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself, were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him, was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.	7.815234424273697
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs.	3.138260615315405
Bennet's ill humour or ill health.	9.297161898927438
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it.	8.537922810690008
He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.	8.214581469216677
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.	7.027849633215182
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed.	7.993323573882979
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near, that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself." She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her.	7.80765549966773
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and was opened immediately.	7.852985382473961
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.	7.6580649356157195
Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs.	8.394280200229906
When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said, "This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a good deal.	8.862769486409677
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.	7.790196220773809
The next was in these words.	8.939927369500191
I depend on you for that." To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.	7.926244752669387
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them." "Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.	7.868460366526177
I will read it to you-- "When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.	8.507994496191625
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I despair.	9.89330978784798
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you." "It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter." "It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_." "Why will you think so?	8.261198179811796
It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.	10.31603858609949
I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.	4.755186863271916
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.	7.1461771170372295
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.	8.351139104711732
My brother admires her greatly already, he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her relations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart.	7.43742071327334
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?" "What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"--said Jane as she finished it.	7.097850970211579
"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard?	8.192889902215512
Can there be any other opinion on the subject?" "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?" "Most willingly." "You shall have it in few words.	8.752854907977376
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you." Jane shook her head.	8.556923099996355
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together, can doubt his affection.	8.45142611626558
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot.	9.932861103793579
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.	8.357179375053072
But the case is this.	8.618623182803086
We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.	8.321376123543542
But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend." "If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this, might make me quite easy.	8.29833723757375
But I know the foundation is unjust.	9.207563833959705
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself." "That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine.	7.958241740681363
Believe her to be deceived by all means.	9.137688277666923
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer." "But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?" "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth, "and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him." "How can you talk so?"--said Jane faintly smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate." "I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion." "But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.	7.781654647397872
A thousand things may arise in six months!" The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.	8.845621211229657
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of every one.	7.326418150312417
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.	6.808284659040218
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.	7.813517185346279
Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together.	8.986088947301553
CHAPTER XXII.	9.416879382657287
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases, and again during the chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.	7.541244495052475
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.	5.456161942218788
This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of;--its object was nothing less, than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself.	8.581679356141262
Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.	9.164448670384555
But here, she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet.	9.046752027855606
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.	8.47735062626913
His reception however was of the most flattering kind.	7.157917418011792
Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.	9.29785433598595
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.	6.3365174888570674
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness.	8.344647351028387
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.	8.882928655594053
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion.	8.689954952970892
The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid.	8.235433732330087
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.	6.678728986891973
Her reflections were in general satisfactory.	11.048850985844718
But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.	6.549195355184616
This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.	6.977067797800199
The least agreeable circumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person.	7.910701397493215
Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation.	9.108796885052001
She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family.	7.553479691499301
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.	7.082001540292733
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs.	7.212041257815065
Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.	8.038200202883292
"My dear Madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible." They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said, "But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness." "My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence." "You cannot be too much on your guard.	7.967549331361053
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence." "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire.	8.499101143104461
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as her's, he might become a very agreeable companion.	7.945911406173992
But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away.	9.26359968238779
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.	7.599343174744498
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out, "Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!" The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied, "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?" But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.	8.723137807855247
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte,--"you must be surprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.	8.226046497198823
But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.	9.891955653527035
I am not romantic you know.	7.358885239536661
I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on entering the marriage state." Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;"--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.	7.695055512069969
Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.	8.979361968609835
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match.	10.655153239503349
The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted.	7.597347973360447
She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.	9.04472134316401
Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins, was a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.	9.03725794517954
CHAPTER XXIII.	9.416879382657287
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family.	8.033388067567326
With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs.	6.836379135388219
Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed, "Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.	9.592355488232123
Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent.	10.477692378577048
In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.	9.838653296286592
Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.	7.019327722689575
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.	8.671270801825136
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.	9.755342394780076
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.	7.842727754573492
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs.	6.663111286990266
Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs.	7.38803335408516
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.	7.9688806047883185
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.	6.7374691384310115
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.	8.285644000091462
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.	9.456089902233444
After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.	8.425853644680426
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs.	6.43038301684136
Bennet.	8.17122241068897
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs.	3.737908130573604
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.	7.562353452936892
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.	9.247899584453068
Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away.	8.145639994892612
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring.	8.862832975075339
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.	8.694622897036561
As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspence was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's; but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to.	7.643395395650357
It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.	7.0393949167077405
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction.	10.270181792145914
He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company.	9.30922526722528
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.	9.78005551726766
Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.	12.721842784737051
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.	7.905189155000496
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her.	5.02553188087417
As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence.	8.639836980427715
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.	8.461079036439989
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.	6.4169603814158584
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!" "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.	7.751745939646773
Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before, "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.	9.56416235228318
If it was not for the entail I should not mind it." "What should not you mind?" "I should not mind any thing at all." "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility." "I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.	8.79996869588039
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?" "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.	7.762528788296281

PRIDE & PREJUDICE.	6.652734987157136
CHAPTER I.	6.87838074833214
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.	9.146729689041635
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.	8.708313126557359
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort.	7.7425883709154455
Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it.	5.585225605073371
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures, some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.	7.6817984938179285
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all the others.	7.667333880731765
That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations.	9.526346895380906
Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself.	8.107599823299275
It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.	10.602295573415603
She could think of nothing else, and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.	8.744381479684733
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs.	6.564356165837553
Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying, "Oh! that my dear mother had more command over herself; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.	8.225981073628477
But I will not repine.	13.314307472160994
He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before." Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.	8.04181144490028
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed you have no reason.	9.57989132708999
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all.	8.299346209205165
A little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better." With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself." "My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good.	7.900385805157819
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you.	5.2899532522406725
I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve." Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.	8.987763624623812
"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair.	6.526249741217382
_You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of any body.	9.873909171024383
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.	5.747904485401442
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will.	8.9927641847992
You need not.	4.16666144617779
There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.	8.328529162888772
The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense.	8.618046890111513
I have met with two instances lately; one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte's marriage.	9.038692006986194
It is unaccountable! in every view it is unaccountable!" "My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.	10.170478080327053
They will ruin your happiness.	6.126568678653977
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper.	7.866182073662829
Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin." "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart.	8.987595267470383
My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him, cannot have a proper way of thinking.	6.796440375826956
You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas.	9.767155245759445
But enough of this.	5.554307535206946
You alluded to something else.	5.519902990568818
I cannot misunderstand you, but I intreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him is sunk.	7.801749563621685
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.	8.566689236809642
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us.	8.065242318439616
Women fancy admiration means more than it does." "And men take care that they should." "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine." "I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.	8.411615023830354
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business." "And do you impute it to either of those?" "Yes; to the last.	7.801533591936362
But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem.	8.46378043154445
Stop me whilst you can." "You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him." "Yes, in conjunction with his friend." "I cannot believe it.	6.461881784355889
Why should they try to influence him?	7.050201400326227
They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it." "Your first position is false.	7.581503789572245
They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride." "Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.	8.321140075721255
They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better.	7.279312148835309
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable?	8.961262089727688
If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed.	9.495612905839932
Do not distress me by the idea.	10.792027936644114
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters.	8.722097140623687
Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood." Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.	9.325446934674268
Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.	8.266103693166295
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.	8.54311521179703
"So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love I find.	5.89728214606874
I congratulate her.	3.37732464639646
Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then.	8.650248812694093
It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions.	9.337804051894327
When is your turn to come?	9.60600057007362
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane.	8.231163287637902
Now is your time.	6.631122151704697
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country.	6.523034485656168
Let Wickham be _your_ man.	5.3275944001823365
He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably." "Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me.	7.270724703097697
We must not all expect Jane's good fortune." "True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it." Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family.	6.648562042084914
They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve.	8.0279637576589
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter.	8.825381521748739
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.	7.068518236775998
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday.	7.49235613902056
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.	8.574272279542916
On the following Monday, Mrs.	5.153895933231695
Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn.	7.31672440054257
Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentleman-like man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education.	8.099794120426832
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well bred and agreeable.	8.969818319465404
Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.	6.119011137323034
Philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces.	8.31105060459121
The first part of Mrs.	4.727437437390583
Gardiner's business on her arrival, was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions.	7.010496940379723
When this was done, she had a less active part to play.	7.920731345285554
They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister.	7.89427919389935
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.	7.798685692000273
"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley, if she could.	8.332129384191687
But, Lizzy! Oh, sister! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had not it been for her own perverseness.	9.421735086306626
He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.	6.313943460424018
The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever.	7.722558621977375
They are all for what they can get.	12.3555150158421
I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is.	7.515394214556353
It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else.	7.158381401546253
However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves." Mrs.	7.179284283153602
Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation.	8.606428918772929
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.	7.421488938669214
"I am sorry it went off.	8.466108963787118
But these things happen so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent." "An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not do for _us_.	8.060425992546223
We do not suffer by _accident_.	10.314613657266639
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before." "But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea.	8.04551553651079
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment.	7.54361071212612
He was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her.	5.946940028610351
Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable.	6.534242127838718
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer.	8.016618010189687
Could there be finer symptoms?	9.470971218917397
Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.	7.597006246025409
It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.	10.266015995811134
Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as anything." Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.	8.539120417937728
Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.	6.348109919434527
Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him." "So much the better.	7.419776878176426
I hope they will not meet at all.	8.204748908251817
_She_ will not be able to help calling." "She will drop the acquaintance entirely." But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.	8.605079376057716
It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's attractions.	11.061089466156458
Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time, than as she hoped that, by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.	9.046518043513666
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.	7.449101938847989
Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner.	8.918111681312794
When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it, of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs.	6.322113182515605
Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both.	8.655647958548139
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.	8.429931290172112
To Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
About ten or a dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire, to which he belonged.	8.135710811456308
They had, therefore, many acquaintance in common; and, though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, five years before, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends, than she had been in the way of procuring.	8.472183105115048
Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.	6.780902071785795
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse.	7.952676334344601
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember something of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad, which might agree with it, and was confident at last, that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.	8.649176026506305
Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: "You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly.	9.004643413086079
Seriously, I would have you be on your guard.	9.55580184000055
Do not involve yourself, or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.	10.864395030347278
I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better.	8.693508005783826
You have sense, and we all expect you to use it.	6.775613897906649
You must not disappoint your father." "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed." "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise." "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm.	7.954359410889641
I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.	7.346270390599495
He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it." "Elizabeth, you are not serious now." "I beg your pardon.	7.569105620803585
I will try again.	7.7226961424894425
At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not.	7.539859075571238
But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not.	7.957638462115371
I see the imprudence of it.--Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it.	7.659874148971993
My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham.	6.503100415944293
In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune, from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?	9.002966791910366
All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry.	9.354878859820287
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object.	8.381779615173574
When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing.	9.373937267942898
At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him." "As I did the other day," said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_.	6.8535844721289925
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week.	10.445331559108642
You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends.	10.171910195082539
But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now, I hope you are satisfied." Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.	9.263052659851441
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.	9.77326611625333
Bennet.	8.17122241068897
As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said, "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza." "_That_ you certainly shall." "And I have another favour to ask.	8.19392347104685
Will you come and see me?" "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire." "I am not likely to leave Kent for some time.	8.068341418714436
Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford." Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.	8.038740392199067
"My father and Maria are to come to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party.	7.919749974275401
Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome to me as either of them." The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual.	7.812159025191804
Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.	9.544323128030046
The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging.	9.115342898809638
It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there, to know the rest.	9.067365065017194
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.	10.094864354075792
Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or hearing from Caroline.	9.087412860066534
She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn, had by some accident been lost.	8.449035722799174
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor-street." She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.	7.442840179722021
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London.	8.760645727213339
I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.	7.343427074438108
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner.	8.584747920397279
I wish I could see her.	5.113570899799489
My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs.	5.8095445583876355
Hurst were going out.	5.6515881643437895
I dare say I shall soon see them here." Elizabeth shook her head over this letter.	7.71316035567347
It convinced her, that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.	6.476882407963247
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him.	5.8032576772843205
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention.	10.197330364888636
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister, will prove what she felt.	9.679225681070337
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment, at my expence, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me.	7.759026089783325
But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert, that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion.	7.981092853084924
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me, but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again.	8.92914421293484
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the mean time.	6.649946460491601
When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal, apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away, I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer.	7.8103783625528695
I pity, though I cannot help blaming her.	5.982780034092372
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on her side.	8.40603364223393
But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it.	9.980310948941652
I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met long, long ago.	8.468983065136602
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy.	8.83267875892347
I cannot understand it.	5.4647025063790196
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt.	8.599406775508237
Let me hear from you very soon.	7.651092734115669
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty.	8.433416427262639
We had better not mention it.	4.709059028734074
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.	8.970432298514432
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria.	9.212491806414304
"Your's, &c." This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.	7.342247087242549
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over.	8.851257614230558
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions.	11.9238113345252
His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.	7.833277455349756
Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself.	7.181698909689977
His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else.	6.3606531824205526
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.	8.98425094513621
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.	6.613303105102697
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady, to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.	8.677765327679259
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.	8.050824666638833
All this was acknowledged to Mrs.	4.546305259736408
Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on:--"I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil.	7.281240452644343
But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King.	8.601072157547588
I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl.	9.563953520469163
There can be no love in all this.	7.343515278775647
My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.	8.93374428677586
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.	6.632972342790063
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do.	6.892647732006435
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on, as well as the plain." CHAPTER IV.	9.612864572736612
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away.	6.01945289573637
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty.	9.203599082498695
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.	7.420826894071917
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter.	9.282225286055926
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.	5.820339107609039
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of every body--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.	7.563622377458992
Her fellow-travellers the next day, were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable.	6.237428520400049
Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise.	8.534384825129004
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon.	8.008506845410386
As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.	7.5949339671027305
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower.	8.554950622919096
All was joy and kindness.	7.134076018448864
Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection.	7.244475449431749
Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.	7.709213761209644
"But, my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King?	7.196386439497638
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary." "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?	8.725644624649336
Where does discretion end, and avarice begin?	9.673479902515117
I know no harm of her." "But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune." "No--why should he?	8.095787270234151
If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?" "But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event." "A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.	8.709530296643702
If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?" "_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_.	8.321590308551151
It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling." "Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose.	7.094400686734256
_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish." "No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose.	9.413968641103766
Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him.	7.7653713653464775
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all." "Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment." Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.	8.141952283369939
"We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.	6.032184902906713
Gardiner, "but perhaps to the Lakes." No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.	10.035474817354524
"My dear, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour.	7.127032348987978
Adieu to disappointment and spleen.	6.322415432894871
What are men to rocks and mountains?	6.399814263091602
Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing.	9.110267272261217
We _will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.	7.903324641420015
Lakes, mountains, and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation.	7.495161084699806
Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers." CHAPTER V.	7.333196679881053
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.	8.89867905581285
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.	9.077161421813381
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side.	5.505371368278714
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.	10.3032441202817
At length the Parsonage was discernible.	6.407577147682464
The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, every thing declared they were arriving.	9.569997467685873
Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party.	8.318765830646134
In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.	9.489790227760722
She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family.	7.984897890887675
They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.	9.598884510373129
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him.	8.884631063519796
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air, with such a companion.	8.088970444878358
When Mr. Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte.	8.427663033737183
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear.	7.943529633371007
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible.	8.66551339992508
He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump.	8.388941405086303
But of all the views which his garden, or which the country, or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house.	7.998821569243358
It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.	8.066144685833432
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows, but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husband's help.	7.601525311082205
It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit.	8.111235202240481
When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.	8.582316366546406
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country.	10.015695860646174
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed, "Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.	8.314803797909786
She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over.	8.796329053452016
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming.	10.460221001363898
Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us.	6.2895780146975095
I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several." "Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour." "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say.	7.957979638589856
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference." The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.	8.301107663547068
She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings.	6.764991118067389
A lively imagination soon settled it all.	4.721349613792492
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her.	7.8591377313031865
She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out, "Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is.	7.744516790295461
"I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter!" "La! my dear," said Maria quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine.	9.138164024176362
The old lady is Mrs.	3.440738941648473
Jenkinson, who lives with them.	7.055916058660524
Only look at her.	3.6320327399304477
She is quite a little creature.	16.619433286378783
Why does she not come in?" "Oh! Charlotte says, she hardly ever does.	7.729994510749593
She will make him a very proper wife." Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way.	8.69628982213842
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house.	8.668482697240375
Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.	7.693905840868258
CHAPTER VI.	7.155281002419743
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.	9.063309741812748
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this?	11.150014511399716
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!" "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.	7.405529177492633
About the Court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon." Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings.	8.284720089284617
Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them.	8.047415864608997
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us, which becomes herself and daughter.	7.297292730949946
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest, there is no occasion for any thing more.	8.803860329473729
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed.	8.513386633471432
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park.--Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh.	7.225979545510338
From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an anti-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs.	6.23058784296368
Jenkinson were sitting.--Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs.	5.808754373058515
Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be her's, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.	9.250575379092327
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly.--Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome.	8.243488833798201
Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them, such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank.	8.529362995189919
There was neither in figure nor face, any likeness between the ladies.	7.930418159037927
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs.	6.0064581013568485
Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.	9.090160466404967
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows, to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.	8.595470983657039
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater.--He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.	8.030693225625807
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them.	6.93371761648889
The party did not supply much conversation.	8.816435143673893
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time.	7.539232493752905
Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she were indisposed.	9.01440623059752
Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.	8.236085445417455
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted.	9.3022464743458
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.	7.253586636258811
Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs.	6.6184383426136675
Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl.	8.455526894486297
She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed, "Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think.	9.280644179264732
For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?" "A little." "Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you.	7.645047571769318
Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing?" "One of them does." "Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned.	8.63865191874863
The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw?" "No, not at all." "What, none of you?" "Not one." "That is very strange.	7.4044147544583865
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters." "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London." "Has your governess left you?" "We never had any governess." "No governess! How was that possible?	9.51469942282483
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing.	7.965814172629358
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education." Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not been the case.	9.025954290820163
"Then, who taught you?	9.173098912958258
who attended to you?	8.141210815787105
Without a governess you must have been neglected." "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn, never wanted the means.	7.800996963772942
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might." "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one.	7.759477404571205
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it.	6.752552525167027
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way.	7.81392673998518
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out.	9.431521358778811
Four nieces of Mrs.	2.9095249808842016
Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day, that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her.	6.30017654221588
Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe's calling yesterday to thank me?	8.603084681059048
She finds Miss Pope a treasure.	5.359211217880008
'Lady Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?" "Yes, Ma'am, all." "All!--What, all five out at once?	7.81553324702565
Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young?" "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen.	9.21145172734079
But really, Ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth, as the first.	7.26231900560423
And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind." "Upon my word," said her Ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray, what is your age?" "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth smiling, "your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it." Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.	8.325090728596026
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age." "I am not one and twenty." When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed.	7.6994334452188555
Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs.	3.7383684179021426
Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs.	7.204215517270526
Jenkinson to make up her party.	8.276624469879772
Their table was superlatively stupid.	6.312881550010057
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs.	6.292100112949907
A great deal more passed at the other table.	10.04345638958548
Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself.	8.260856108204022
Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.	9.276878320696458
Sir William did not say much.	9.517793190081212
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names.	7.0361611984375205
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broke up, the carriage was offered to Mrs.	6.549920152821368
Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered.	11.73098269061125
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach, and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side, and as many bows on Sir William's, they departed.	8.313172668331926
As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin, to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was.	8.955254770553195
But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship's praise into his own hands.	8.817596508541985
CHAPTER VII.	7.918620115753125
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with.	10.048639456803654
While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and shewing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road.	8.890183328299628
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.	8.999761451689047
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.	8.413562131724238
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day.	8.432703132203113
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out.	7.391879441496469
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.	9.163557314497595
Now and then, they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits.	9.7087908676024
She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs.	7.499872913402191
Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.	7.4449312248640345
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.	8.41880060630361
This however was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.	8.20558573492682
Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.	8.268069592971628
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.	7.744677532688074
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it, was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important.	7.277872866119056
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine; who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.	8.896595808621436
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage, for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it; and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence.	8.372904351321814
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects.	6.6026353115036835
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ---- and to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him.	6.6065628765894076
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me." Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.	7.45644948293552
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.	6.508120054932837
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs.	7.4273736359372595
Collins, sat for some time without speaking to any body.	8.370579716729571
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family.	8.204480096731274
She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added, "My eldest sister has been in town these three months.	9.756337224517832
Have you never happened to see her there?" She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.	9.533002299817701
The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.	6.795913896069015
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings.	9.963552100720774
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter.	9.44478796345732
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had only seen at church.	9.011530611301335
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room.	6.094967848557527
Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.	7.485378631185298
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs.	7.705425567121425
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.	6.636882694288962
_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out, "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam?	8.990541931923305
What are you telling Miss Bennet?	10.256075347333665
Let me hear what it is." "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.	7.624296680184824
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud.	6.207407601027591
It is of all subjects my delight.	8.393740132785974
I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.	10.312843965886502
If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient.	12.64501761087484
I am confident that she would have performed delightfully.	14.738376088601775
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.	9.054863420146475
She practises very constantly." "So much the better.	5.206725004528333
I often tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired, without constant practice.	8.54632917699468
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the piano-forte in Mrs.	7.500672755379455
Jenkinson's room.	6.209820066090384
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.	8.923123907042113
He drew a chair near her.	3.7642010432594617
Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano-forte, stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.	8.485120196650739
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said, "You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me?	8.149548992988946
But I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well.	8.072618377023108
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others.	8.853379922078016
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me." "I shall not say that you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own." Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.	7.521008088621985
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a part of the world, where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit.	9.644865227546518
Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear." "I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.	7.182725530167144
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did?	8.98259756604564
Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party." "True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room.	8.472432198966812
Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?	9.94752168018721
My fingers wait your orders." "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers." "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.	6.552647413818215
"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him.	6.6804101391212205
It is because he will not give himself the trouble." "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.	6.781756389291916
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done." "My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do.	8.63079397085497
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take the trouble of practising.	10.145750046852353
You have employed your time much better.	7.392623664335466
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think any thing wanting.	11.138691397466797
We neither of us perform to strangers." Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of.	9.213778432084043
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.	5.281888027828313
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy, "Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss, if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master.	8.420325244199354
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.	7.50205384975433
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.	10.108384177290494
CHAPTER IX.	7.155281002419743
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane, while Mrs.	7.072997127255217
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within.	9.581670715608464
They then sat down, and when her enquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence.	6.22295970507257
It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed, "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before.	8.18087477499013
He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London." "Perfectly so--I thank you." She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added, "I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?" "I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future.	8.474739249907376
He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing." "If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there.	7.6355635070206604
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house.	8.01468539619412
Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford." "I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object." "Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife." "Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had.	7.986836640729757
My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did.	8.088562414815605
She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her." "It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends." "An easy distance do you call it?	7.547704028358823
It is nearly fifty miles." "And what is fifty miles of good road?	10.729745752958546
Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance." "I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match," cried Elizabeth.	8.03702876193321
The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances.	9.557542074046927
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil.	6.06981997815734
But that is not the case _here_.	11.489877240479887
Mr. and Mrs.	2.894456551441913
Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance." Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment.	7.761021230840461
_You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn." Elizabeth looked surprised.	9.84584024509461
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice, "Are you pleased with Kent?" A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk.	7.709763223339683
The tête-à-tête surprised them.	3.9051998194058255
Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away.	8.54345418128221
"What can be the meaning of this!" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone.	9.120667888430642
"My dear Eliza he must be in love with you, or he would never have called on us in this familiar way." But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year.	8.521433204572308
All field sports were over.	5.150405150167097
Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.	7.971548312343439
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.	7.112925602061501
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.	9.537321067742305
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand.	8.598115202185706
It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself.	7.17291225985587
He seldom appeared really animated.	7.163548018529612
Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love, and the object of that love, her friend Eliza, she sat herself seriously to work to find it out.--She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success.	8.54597459200598
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable.	7.174356209660465
It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.	7.600796838648521
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam.	7.327492326482343
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.	7.632450100236385
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy.--She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first, that it was a favourite haunt of hers.--How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd!--Yet it did, and even a third.	7.792674215708987
It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her.	7.516144099974385
He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs.	6.6635471181754395
Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying _there_ too.	7.7894761368828656
His words seemed to imply it.	4.373462252620571
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?	10.913400129031556
She supposed, if he meant any thing, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter.	8.928017555916519
It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.	8.695112020496035
She was engaged one day as she walked, in re-perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.	7.411984633056602
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said, "I did not know before that you ever walked this way." "I have been making the tour of the Park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage.	7.176481317531856
Are you going much farther?" "No, I should have turned in a moment." And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.	9.327289057731457
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.	7.036006601702116
"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again.	7.619562114040028
He arranges the business just as he pleases." "And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice.	9.6859000477565
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy." "He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.	8.500772023592354
"But so we all do.	7.106154923187218
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor.	9.734075103473012
I speak feelingly.	10.899001022432467
A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence." "In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either.	6.986192074267362
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?" "These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature.	8.498494633130798
But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from the want of money.	8.16690929739314
Younger sons cannot marry where they like." "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do." "Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money." "Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?	8.33767575713462
Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds." He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped.	9.951942489042946
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said, "I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal.	8.327329348900749
I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.	6.868310992275011
And pray what sort of guardians do you make?	10.711161761375768
Does your charge give you much trouble?	9.023002735340555
Young ladies of her age, are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way." As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth.	8.315988458330395
She directly replied, "You need not be frightened.	10.446185414849953
I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.	7.273898627985614
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs.	7.933189529846068
Hurst and Miss Bingley.	5.924782662912541
I think I have heard you say that you know them." "I know them a little.	8.471933461733707
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's." "Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily--"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him." "Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.	7.25876798163704
From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him.	8.094957148102475
But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant.	10.026981667218939
What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer." "Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?" "I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady." "And what arts did he use to separate them?" "He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam smiling.	8.639091610816742
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she.	9.2665944906194
"Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings.	11.526076698196597
Why was he to be the judge?" "You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?" "I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy." "But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him.	7.264543379457341
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case." "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly." This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage.	8.066260319992727
There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard.	7.893641910432488
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them.	7.7396574852419
If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.	9.313196821485404
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.	9.445662445898261
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.	7.952597405264325
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection.	8.205737368503101
All loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating.	7.376830697616492
Neither could any thing be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.	8.569164757326003
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea.	8.403622451919949
Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.	8.863092015082906
They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.	5.6784283474653705
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next, and a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.	8.708305639696096
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent, without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.	9.022652677515874
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire particularly after her.	8.66237081700887
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.	6.840351670028138
He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up walked about the room.	7.099259311008946
Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word.	7.863832447341117
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began, "In vain have I struggled.	8.782348904818297
My feelings will not be repressed.	12.217288298902133
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you." Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.	8.181602980833967
She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent.	4.524055428560941
He spoke well, but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride.	8.131000680246027
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger.	8.249220475576315
She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done.	7.6373620688837764
As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer.	9.612056671431331
He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security.	6.451641644625799
It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you.	7.829400600467925
But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly.	8.38198060602613
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one.	9.018246055979697
The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation." Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise.	7.551257851555993
His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature.	8.388371209330415
He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips, till he believed himself to have attained it.	7.676674334270053
The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful.	9.027309358870658
At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said, "And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected.	7.313182874385335
But it is of small importance." "I might as well enquire," replied she, "why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?	8.158197577027794
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil?	7.930179199212398
But I have other provocations.	11.035385678695716
You know I have.	7.327920162160474
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.	6.81779365099659
You dare not, you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind." She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.	7.616157293766149
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.	7.263803913187034
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.	10.13061989821048
With assumed tranquillity he then replied, "I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success.	8.931046322536
Towards _him_ I have been kinder than towards myself." Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.	7.206420341359684
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded.	7.500623142104697
Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was decided.	8.234088203271755
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham.	8.258119754451977
On this subject, what can you have to say?	8.77512666879392
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?	8.691229297626704
or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?" "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.	8.089640659470916
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?" "His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed." "And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy.	7.862102987516272
You have withheld the advantages, which you must know to have been designed for him.	7.464117232648889
You have deprived the best years of his life, of that independence which was no less his due than his desert.	9.619042460454823
You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule." "And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully.	8.596104451221098
My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offences might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design.	7.80383874797035
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I with greater policy concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by every thing.	6.800379229381796
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.	7.66798650402736
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related.	8.004538375099536
They were natural and just.	9.788544001241547
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?	13.056288942253612
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?" Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said, "You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner." She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued, "You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it." Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.	8.819120076739665
"From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry." "You have said quite enough, madam.	8.032643394835146
I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.	8.052599263477635
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great.	9.447593631938531
She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour.	6.3140273269017815
Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it.	6.188662860755168
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months! so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection.	9.101961638662367
But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited.	8.224742437043275
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes.	7.446246088992069
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led her farther from the turnpike road.	9.150942155693185
The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.	7.540852998697577
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park.	8.899244032500022
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent, had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees.	10.071688666414655
She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating.	8.533546124583504
But the person who advanced, was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.	8.069264890641948
She had turned away, but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate.	8.406407348737932
He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.	7.669440862746069
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written quite through, in a very close hand.--The envelope itself was likewise full.--Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it.	6.161390604424923
I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes, which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation, and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.	8.206229504385316
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.	7.4285559257935905
"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge.	8.016419160942448
The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity, and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison.--But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--If, in the explanation of them which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your's, I can only say that I am sorry.--The necessity must be obeyed--and farther apology would be absurd.--I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your eldest sister, to any other young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.	8.156320966123785
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.	9.595311775905351
From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him.	8.4086606492096
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--If it be so, if I have been misled by such error, to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable.	9.302980255516058
But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such, as might have given the most acute observer, a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to the marriage were not merely those, which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me.--These causes must be stated, though briefly.--The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you.	8.45533179936227
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.	8.114230201042409
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.--I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.	7.2098735393227855
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town.	9.0846417661175
I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.--It is done, however, and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer.	8.3555266348723
If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family.	7.777813422469161
Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.	9.970466665724098
Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust, naturally inclined my father to be of service to him, and on George Wickham, who was his god-son, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed.	8.035989537202921
My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education.	9.607707779538735
My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it.	8.304721448947776
As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner.	8.685453983115956
The vicious propensities--the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.	8.039049939951736
Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you only can tell.	7.920884279586922
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character.	7.797432987020794
It adds even another motive.	6.429250296916526
My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant.	7.7054975020973835
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.	6.932515202839197
His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited.	9.139073526948142
He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein.	9.098475400360082
I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal.	10.486218528286248
I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman.	9.082569646028231
The business was therefore soon settled.	6.714275002932618
All connection between us seemed now dissolved.	7.976040698203384
I thought too ill of him, to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town.	8.50531652264839
In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.	7.544811431616047
His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad.	8.340669545864392
He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions.	8.86283635169621
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition of it.	5.532820312108385
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others, as in his reproaches to myself.	8.331583246966261
After this period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropt.	7.877585301522381
How he lived I know not.	4.544224320292166
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being.	9.152290910253988
Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy.	9.234531710843987
My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.	8.747406570154054
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs.	7.591655373315095
Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.	7.92996139418745
She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself.	7.20819450738974
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me.	6.535329601676967
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted.	9.650450048432502
Younge was of course removed from her charge.	10.621105286191453
Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me, was a strong inducement.	9.348230100540114
His revenge would have been complete indeed.	8.233137225949163
I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at.	9.653469307908601
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.	10.345569003247158
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night.	8.640072064039181
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.	10.250805356215274
For the truth of every thing here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and still more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions.	8.439652383258975
If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning.	8.602976414541361
I will only add, God bless you.	5.053819594103327
"FITZWILLIAM DARCY." CHAPTER XIII.	8.144937176743532
But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.	6.649001046005055
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined.	11.09181495940939
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal.	9.393213905203448
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield.	8.254516189427743
She read, with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes.	7.710353047459985
His belief of her sister's insensibility, she instantly resolved to be false, and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice.	9.79426266538131
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty.	9.051510773157373
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham, when she read with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events, which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself, her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.	7.666501674985547
She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.	8.392039330639081
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.	8.643682790960414
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family, was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words.	8.84227022114857
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err.	8.776052459863415
But when she read, and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu, so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate.	8.19962631789903
She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success.	10.197789525220188
Again she read on.	5.979343648495731
But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent, as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.	8.535360715538422
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.	7.837294164325137
Of his former way of life, nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself.	8.535816662314119
As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of enquiring.	10.234646685605165
His countenance, voice, and manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.	10.17126808009221
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class, what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance.	6.623639222074541
She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess.	9.706166574055292
After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read.	7.810596239305735
But, alas! the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.	10.130167756343145
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.	9.451622952322275
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.	7.825422683711895
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory.	12.716171866425345
She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before.	9.58357144294202
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct.	8.577726677291784
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week.	7.2576056389346695
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn.	8.680030864327598
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance, an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways, seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits.	7.404425075158295
That had his actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.	8.510711811404024
"How despicably have I acted!" she cried.--"I, who have prided myself on my discernment!--I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity, in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet, how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind.	7.3560120862118925
But vanity, not love, has been my folly.--Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned.	8.91826599524069
Till this moment, I never knew myself." From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again.	8.357384328191072
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.--How could she deny that credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other?--He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment;--and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been.--Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane.--She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great sensibility.	8.99768912835398
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.	8.773082534650994
The compliment to herself and her sister, was not unfelt.	8.46876883342936
It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self-attracted by the rest of her family;--and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before.	9.086370534070602
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought; re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.	7.080776062449103
She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes to take leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found.--Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it.	7.769824605677708
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object.	7.976136724181042
She could think only of her letter.	8.61501279199296
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings.	7.101284310925437
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine, and her daughter; and on his return, brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.	7.466272429585188
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting, that had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her, as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been.	8.141967616191808
"What would she have said?--how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.	7.1724797795105975
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--"I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do.	7.191510217315772
But I am particularly attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are.	9.985965204474011
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more I think than last year.	6.888767100298882
His attachment to Rosings, certainly increases." Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.	6.851052463029168
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added, "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer.	10.277884186449691
I expected you to stay two months.	8.37553670954838
There can be no occasion for your going so soon.	8.424073660268892
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight." "But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return." "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father.	7.590653155445199
And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large." "You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan." Lady Catherine seemed resigned.	8.540179221477413
"Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
Collins, you must send a servant with them.	7.23375079029292
You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.	7.630704956408779
It is highly improper.	13.844738064542979
You must contrive to send somebody.	10.916304537208338
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life.	7.24598333485609
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things.	7.272355708302334
You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.	5.697191870336646
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone." "My uncle is to send a servant for us." "Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things.	7.743735678689299
Where shall you change horses?--Oh! Bromley, of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to." Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was.	7.798456726594374
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.	8.65749297566891
Mr. Darcy's letter, she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart.	7.439676680528854
She studied every sentence: and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different.	8.398399318732467
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again.	7.556581518606237
In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin.	8.15584100452871
They were hopeless of remedy.	10.493123742672262
Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil.	8.564483664170792
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement?	10.462755109276033
Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing.	8.634844740918671
They were ignorant, idle, and vain.	8.79788571220241
While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for ever.	8.493139347489228
Anxiety on Jane's behalf, was another prevailing concern, and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost.	8.263683571862185
How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.	7.893881213098789
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay, as they had been at first.	8.12410649459911
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.	8.267255781982499
CHAPTER XV.	7.155281002419743
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.	7.987301860436868
"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs.	5.385124915762035
Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us, but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it.	7.446409431779618
The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you.	7.606990960841918
Our plain manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly." Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.	8.109549825055636
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_ feel the obliged.	9.333160816853425
Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied, "It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably.	9.31808931344544
You see on what a footing we are.	6.807657148840222
You see how continually we are engaged there.	8.832349378174607
In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings." Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.	9.421418164380349
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin.	8.525333649198835
Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs.	5.299395430130846
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent.	8.69963001555867
Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.	7.420664032804371
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.	8.915811574009261
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us.	7.617068223868596
Poor Charlotte!--it was melancholy to leave her to such society!--But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion.	9.312195530360883
After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs.	7.584694745113256
He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.	8.185243530098209
"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here." Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.	8.188027834162146
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!" "A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.	9.130591561584218
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell!" Elizabeth privately added, "And how much I shall have to conceal." Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.	9.389066499538261
Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them.	6.78690489266471
But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.	10.282900831290789
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals.	8.81340845002427
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision in which she remained, as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley, which might only grieve her sister farther.	8.314545847665107
CHAPTER XVI.	7.155281002419743
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch-street, for the town of ---- in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.	8.451402847560098
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice?	7.317307986064358
is not this an agreeable surprise?" "And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia; "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then shewing her purchases: "Look here, I have bought this bonnet.	8.558307411695507
I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not.	8.78330728253628
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better." And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable.	9.40741704789603
Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight." "Are they indeed?" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.	8.152616403122115
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme, and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all.	8.486065859592046
Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!" "Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once.	8.018493152254628
It is excellent news, capital news, and about a certain person that we all like." Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay.	8.578722880087355
Lydia laughed, and said, "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion.	8.088454500658163
You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say.	8.036865125363768
I never saw such a long chin in my life.	8.683487240186063
Well, but now for my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?	9.82424473238091
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King.	11.229360497694477
There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay.	8.88445245889027
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her.	6.404017745100579
Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?" Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.	7.670077670978023
"How nicely we are crammed in!" cried Lydia.	8.63901298694843
"I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home.	7.821452752073322
And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away.	8.52716813242395
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.	9.140127212306677
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.	10.68462912846492
She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think.	7.226828236665884
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it.	7.05268843623304
Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's.	7.80190918617203
Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.	5.909160870643302
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs.	6.750447037772705
Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did?	7.806805627940749
We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.	8.209539423132838
and Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
Forster.	18.70742934517326
I thought I should have died.	11.398697136878761
Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.	7.7741588512876865
Their reception at home was most kind.	7.260212439584503
Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth, "I am glad you are come back, Lizzy." Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs.	7.512274785693953
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her.	7.889367096160779
"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! as we went along, Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.	8.915214116231876
And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach.	11.07262959918557
I was ready to die of laughter.	11.472286263422689
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds.	6.6691945376273685
But I confess they would have no charms for _me_.	11.905220795576197
I should infinitely prefer a book." But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.	7.978976884265859
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.	6.760387022515551
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme.	8.189797499877589
It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.	9.195971203716809
The comfort to _her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond expression.	8.362109907431284
In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.	9.944624922826561
She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.	9.213948389533963
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.	7.5384800791842235
CHAPTER XVII.	7.155281002419743
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.	7.799596233264935
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings.	8.30023445314846
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.	9.338212387357997
What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual.	8.108706605695133
Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.	10.204025830636432
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other.	6.479886090606768
"This will not do," said Elizabeth.	6.292071578438564
Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one.	7.88636681862429
There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much.	8.229674976021544
For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy's, but you shall do as you chuse." It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.	7.690886206652796
"Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief.	10.055118864869975
And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered.	9.708102842163141
Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing.	9.401643647737327
I am sure you must feel it so." "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both.	9.113516589886022
I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent.	8.387068810250556
Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather." "Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner." "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men.	9.12582113514872
One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it." "I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do." "And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason.	7.673674340082174
It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind.	9.521553065738988
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just; but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty." "Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now." "Indeed I could not.	8.347588999435105
I was uncomfortable enough.	9.911575770461475
I was very uncomfortable, I may say unhappy.	11.491675828599094
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness, is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging.	10.747320857081597
I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham's character." Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully.	9.985812307640384
What is your own opinion?" "That it ought not to be attempted.	11.632348400249079
Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public.	10.170952376081512
The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light.	8.547080072748349
I am not equal to it.	5.547004354701113
Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here, what he really is.	8.486734150038712
Sometime hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.	6.787542423780026
At present I will say nothing about it." "You are quite right.	7.59549891914519
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever.	5.819212756841738
We must not make him desperate." The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.	9.656117010531187
She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend.	8.977983919653132
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.	7.650995686944185
"And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself.	7.111078141030046
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!" She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits.	8.919406577711849
Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.	8.299130669439233
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs.	4.082636058639655
Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane's?	9.229473173304347
For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody.	9.174791464890333
I told my sister Philips so the other day.	7.168035872717507
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London.	10.581652035386497
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of every body too, who is likely to know." "I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more." "Oh, well! it is just as he chooses.	9.677317061608576
Nobody wants him to come.	7.483774430540668
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.	6.906609026042664
Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he has done." But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.	9.353604055652083
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they?	6.967796643880363
And what sort of table do they keep?	10.559408532751993
Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say.	7.644353910293295
There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say." "No, nothing at all." "A great deal of good management, depend upon it.	6.245470123905789
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income.	7.866192742206238
But I make no doubt, they often talk of it between themselves.	8.779290179524864
Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better.	9.463834411284262
_I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me." CHAPTER XVIII.	9.68626673615303
The first week of their return was soon gone.	9.69886310460147
The second began.	6.775992498453811
It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace.	9.155824631598072
The dejection was almost universal.	8.208067767298033
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments.	9.40420519042551
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.	6.118649297594337
"How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?" Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five and twenty years ago.	8.344908668772762
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar's regiment went away.	6.685568475652461
I thought I should have broke my heart." "I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.	7.345906516457997
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs.	7.23589119615357
Bennet.	8.17122241068897
"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable." "A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever." "And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good," added Kitty.	7.161692780751359
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn-house.	5.794662808506167
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame.	8.551178857632229
She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.	8.440339632250804
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs.	7.018065342543082
Forster, the wife of the Colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton.	9.71228728107925
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs.	5.071984808142073
Forster, the delight of Mrs.	4.957857628451272
Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described.	11.026992369236767
Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy, calling for every one's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.	7.5955350871476455
"I cannot see why Mrs.	6.7450510706703835
As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.	9.2916669019809
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs.	7.93650104592149
Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home.	7.807705623510781
He heard her attentively, and then said, "Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances." "If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair." "Already arisen!" repeated Mr. Bennet.	7.949683982990105
"What, has she frightened away some of your lovers?	9.731281729683008
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity, are not worth a regret.	8.370298064166088
Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly." "Indeed you are mistaken.	10.376061989723965
I have no such injuries to resent.	10.60456747007497
It is not of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining.	7.648838431257801
Our importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character.	8.17884339064157
Excuse me--for I must speak plainly.	9.79276739903948
If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.	7.282955008733624
Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous.	8.737844019895602
A flirt too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite.	7.25391015779885
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended.	9.0816141381378
She will follow wherever Lydia leads.	8.633752548354877
Wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three very silly sisters.	7.03857785857456
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.	9.27972916628303
Let her go then.	8.379679033499489
Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body.	7.915838593483192
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here.	7.967212532856662
The officers will find women better worth their notice.	6.970981451359151
Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance.	8.8125082842945
At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life." With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry.	8.285579043942011
It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations, by dwelling on them.	6.763802542890738
She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.	8.659332232920965
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility.	9.128596667878721
In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness.	8.157104057391681
She saw with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers.	7.617027013824303
She saw all the glories of the camp; its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.	6.68990353844701
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations?	8.484959603223144
They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.	10.70502341203899
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.	9.084566017353087
Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so.	5.65192185970286
She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary.	7.390518877731242
In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance, could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her.	7.154822790679012
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.	8.837856110571654
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.	8.35017683318152
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and after observing that he was a very gentleman-like man, asked her how she had liked him.	8.437979498832293
Her answer was warmly in his favour.	7.366842815839219
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, "How long did you say that he was at Rosings?" "Nearly three weeks." "And you saw him frequently?" "Yes, almost every day." "His manners are very different from his cousin's." "Yes, very different.	8.356273211503545
"And pray may I ask?" but checking himself, he added in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves?	11.382772927172988
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style?	7.527168360454114
"In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was." While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning.	7.620492813583765
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added, "When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement, but that from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood." Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents, "You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right.	8.107830331074226
His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by.	7.908337580870291
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness, to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe.	8.085135861536585
His fear of her, has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart." Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head.	8.629275401776338
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him.	7.758642819968819
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs.	6.855661915892556
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic.	6.992932368261098
Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy.	9.186011458389007
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible; advice, which there was every reason to believe would be attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.	9.674973893001809
CHAPTER XIX.	7.155281002419743
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort.	9.180085986555087
Respect, esteem, and confidence, had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.	8.622216848536874
But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice.	7.534892602996646
He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments.	9.004009729157634
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement.	8.219347572910076
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.	8.14093506313687
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband.	11.216606859462255
She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible.	9.489353925818437
But she had never felt so strongly as now, the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents which rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.	6.983442778434894
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure, she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.	10.043371187177074
Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire, did not in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself.	8.227113314411765
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment.	8.216366638729856
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.	8.483463171751952
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.	7.8575196934569815
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.	11.536994100765352
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized.	9.634324877937095
A scheme of which every part promises delight, can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation." When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short.	8.691717109992561
Those to her mother, contained little else, than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs.	7.868562586989643
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour and cheerfulness began to re-appear at Longbourn.	8.29363039266087
Everything wore a happier aspect.	7.579741732199055
Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity, and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope, that by the following Christmas, she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war-office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.	8.34051073367269
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs.	7.277625257835347
Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.	7.651880602871024
Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire.	8.63445496680477
In that county, there was enough to be seen, to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs.	6.606868569453087
Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction.	9.045232535712838
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of her curiosity, as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.	7.579632555351067
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough.	9.036705136069301
But it was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.	7.56464008904932
With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected.	9.57475296304614
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner.	9.565396421932949
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival.	10.542867750564104
But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs.	3.746793837519597
The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.	7.841224051835865
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.	6.5850046218358775
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenelworth, Birmingham, &c.	5.28519509490174
are sufficiently known.	7.220884732681564
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern.	11.141797088972643
Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated.	9.613655190326774
In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs.	4.7232829054162915
Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again.	5.737848223453637
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt.	9.167706556021662
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know." Elizabeth was distressed.	7.7885458602487
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it.	6.128585149442866
She must own that she was tired of great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.	7.454636254695761
"If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful.	7.181710654936886
The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred.	8.63951454908118
It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such a risk.	10.71797070813504
But against this, there were objections; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family, were unfavourably answered.	8.264499226396156
Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its proprietor, and with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer.	8.10062048222589
To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.	5.8786759810897395

CHAPTER I.	6.87838074833214
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.	10.451309014593507
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view.	7.642310318723989
It was a large, handsome, stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills;--and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance.	6.967441105175207
Its banks were neither formal, nor falsely adorned.	7.073655671500099
Elizabeth was delighted.	15.358313376992108
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste.	9.764233916533415
They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt, that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned.	7.1644972923647785
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken.	7.976878262066922
On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.	9.040213040807751
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking, elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her.	6.222997456075628
It was a large, well-proportioned room, handsomely fitted up.	7.913058382362705
Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.	10.093011405782542
The hill, crowned with wood, from which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.	6.158588512573781
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight.	9.988736379896958
As they passed into other rooms, these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen.	6.601995875039911
The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.	7.324777409023193
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting herself,--"that could never be: my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me: I should not have been allowed to invite them." This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.	8.14902838830407
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper, whether her master were really absent, but had not courage for it.	6.2451247083099455
At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.	6.890283884225477
She approached, and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantle-piece.	6.03742566131697
Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.	5.3166336134755605
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"He is now gone into the army," she added, "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild." Mrs.	7.927609935840009
Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.	7.626053769318514
Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master--and very like him.	6.474602479570415
It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago." "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs.	8.076071884121257
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face.	10.915694808429073
But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not." Mrs.	7.025483540451093
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?" Elizabeth coloured, and said--"A little." "And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?" "Yes, very handsome." "I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this.	7.356994156028178
This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then.	8.892533900496023
He was very fond of them." This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.	8.345048932822111
Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.	8.626483406506662
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mr. Gardiner.	8.897154815264676
"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long.	6.771124854458094
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him." Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs.	6.696912212206388
Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.	8.24090031415508
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?" "Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months." "Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate." "If your master would marry, you might see more of him." "Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.	8.127550720487971
Gardiner smiled.	7.329071934792965
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old." This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas.	8.627459773659211
That he was not a good-tempered man, had been her firmest opinion.	7.390372745319627
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying, "There are very few people of whom so much can be said.	8.871507866742787
You are lucky in having such a master." "Yes, Sir, I know I am.	7.9907400400279665
If I was to go through the world, I could not meet with a better.	9.625897696103193
But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted, boy in the world." Elizabeth almost stared at her.--"Can this be Mr. Darcy!" thought she.	6.919588151887068
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs.	6.5302522712248505
"Yes, Ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor." Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more.	7.439691992688505
She related the subject of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain.	10.101546758295278
Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.	8.788152700906403
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived.	8.51303455137094
Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but themselves.	7.240883457427496
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name.	10.287136090856823
Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it.	5.6593781659747515
To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men." "In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.	8.03366327984643
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt, as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend." "Perhaps we might be deceived." "That is not very likely; our authority was too good." On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.	8.42665337732334
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.	10.0193019601219
Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room.	7.719518866318605
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger.	9.202597226184466
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her.	6.291937319554454
At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen, when he looked at her.	7.152365694727756
Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his father's life time.	8.123503680217683
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original, than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance.	9.360439998142398
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs.	4.482957571957608
Reynolds was of no trifling nature.	8.01139690020255
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant?	9.878904318158666
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned down stairs, and taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.	9.47180960333589
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight.	7.052953513418529
Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush.	8.296750075657837
He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.	8.130607773897225
She had instinctively turned away; but, stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome.	9.642390169604866
Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it.	7.988083361869897
At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.	8.804634320528756
The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence.	7.914749635516616
She was overpowered by shame and vexation.	7.781346914417733
Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?	9.167396966986097
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected?	12.288345652407356
Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination, for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage.	9.237295560000707
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting.	8.15266694035211
And his behaviour, so strikingly altered,--what could it mean?	6.5110986039172305
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosing's Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, nor how to account for it.	7.810111601472052
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene.	8.651769244083486
Perhaps he had been civil, only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was not like ease.	11.173541761545264
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.	8.99643215648513
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.	7.1046152644607945
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream.	8.733132675230683
With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten miles round.	9.388141719457202
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, in one of its narrowest parts.	8.112077587921505
They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.	6.698597852264608
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs.	6.323292355205432
Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible.	7.856656723312178
Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little.	8.589815390328823
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance.	8.43242041431632
Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them.	8.649617522647713
For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path.	9.783400958342277
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them.	6.793596995061096
Her colour changed, and she said no more.	5.72707455639214
Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her, if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.	9.348075348703505
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself.	7.768198866090268
"What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of fashion." The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions.	7.894046277402722
Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph.	7.933604165975374
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.	9.110548302224137
The conversation soon turned upon fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.	8.763811465232589
Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her wonder.	9.298311901889187
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself.	7.257945129642791
Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered?	9.327612139848801
From what can it proceed?	12.855530383840797
It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake that his manners are thus softened.	9.37954703396335
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this.	8.465440903009567
It is impossible that he should still love me." After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration.	9.798706194756639
It originated in Mrs.	2.703926311721087
Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's.	8.729546335107663
After a short silence, the lady first spoke.	9.607331551881316
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.	9.197371458485044
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was not very differently engaged.	8.678219459565476
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her, must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.	7.618085053969112
His wish of introducing his sister to her, was a compliment of the highest kind.	8.02120505555675
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.	11.04508827010273
He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn.	9.360796459458685
At such a time, much might have been said, and silence was very awkward.	10.16179171368061
She wanted to talk, but there seemed an embargo on every subject.	7.352004126590939
At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.	8.718427849214802
Gardiner's coming up, they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness.	9.173393073912255
Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage, and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.	9.156083127676974
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.	9.824384677768403
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.	8.1557804758027
"There _is_ something a little stately in him to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming.	8.80104954106303
I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it." "I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us.	6.93600973318563
It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention.	11.061874523459988
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling." "To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good.	8.170434036736367
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable?" Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.	9.113739498588146
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle.	11.473283782868945
"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds." Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing.	8.723843407814233
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs.	5.963740751521952
Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body, as he has done by poor Wickham.	9.659801800483923
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks.	9.767581387848
And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart.	8.881610348112224
But to be sure, the good lady who shewed us the house, did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes.	9.696653876274684
But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue." Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.	8.60285217830551
Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of any thing else.	8.725798484841276
Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.	10.349055020414076
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.	7.858470760207581
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton, these visitors came.	7.44568794387677
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle, driving up the street.	8.74173326236729
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she expected.	8.327824749147101
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business.	9.760766811318565
Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.	9.474770318704337
While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was every moment increasing.	7.303197250941278
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.	9.224350883817895
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt, as made every thing worse.	8.333527078669821
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place.	7.694130399015943
With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.	7.258028219949217
Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was only exceedingly shy.	9.372780168434318
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.	8.282841669696499
She was less handsome than her brother, but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle.	9.491411653199977
They had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room.	8.94330936890829
All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her again.	8.319125279341277
He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.	8.493855945099
To Mr. and Mrs.	2.552691141360739
Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself.	6.72166949329554
They had long wished to see him.	6.73358324274472
The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention.	7.7373758692211085
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards each with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love.	7.936249715077237
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do.	7.740513669749721
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour.	8.161311774508572
Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.	7.126650770802692
Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance.	8.781681994501147
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister.	6.66569713794142
On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared.	6.853972783198427
He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months.	7.626685230465786
We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield." Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn.	7.819561954209152
There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.	10.359491911875587
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion of people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible.	8.542593515915947
Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.	7.90681633484951
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs.	6.863986943400838
Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.	8.002848928304472
Presuming, however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment, than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.	8.022620495085906
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.	7.490103021651596
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little.	9.51609032959966
Eager to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.	8.967734160418436
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs.	4.885465641392021
They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify enquiry.	9.238856705033703
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.	7.5956438188980915
They could not be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character from their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known, would not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy.	8.36099986479918
There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible, that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.	8.70894951507221
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight.	10.760951290948784
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town, where the family did not visit.	7.9745661243895185
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the son of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.	8.346026677554065
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out.	8.32663576671538
But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked.	8.682417286030493
It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection.	7.735159953693235
He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister.	7.071109797832413
Such a change in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined.	8.354843996412813
She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.	8.853540090978973
It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning.	8.488360407009507
They were, therefore, to go.--Elizabeth was pleased, though, when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.	6.82681341571414
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast.	13.068951226613226
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon.	7.883671841113222
On reaching the house, they were shewn through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.	7.221804223980287
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.	6.632664292601655
Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved.	10.03663895300012
Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.	6.772995746431961
By Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments.	8.587484749119751
It was first broken by Mrs.	5.019179048401587
Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs.	7.1887451234667274
Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on.	7.830155781351183
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.	10.454824142773077
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention.	7.015629376542997
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much.	8.46500631058824
Her own thoughts were employing her.	4.164487317242541
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room.	5.7586269528601495
She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.	5.471438594352185
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs.	6.493126134925824
Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post.	11.68917716888099
There was now employment for the whole party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected them round the table.	8.316734502450181
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.	8.350300460629878
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.	8.294666001218086
No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room.	8.03520876135014
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over.	7.76509277431513
Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded, as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side.	9.41544696745972
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility, "Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?	9.048749106576741
They must be a great loss to _your_ family." In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone.	9.265333527641337
While she spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes.	6.496892926851089
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement.	10.088130954941132
To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own.	7.301452912213266
He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.	9.685138731690165
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.	7.613353089503539
Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have fixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.	8.21961839152862
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above-mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage, Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress.	8.296458678186703
Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his judgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable.	8.381016193327996
She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again." However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.	8.219787976929217
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.	7.386450472417928
Her nose wants character; there is nothing marked in its lines.	8.063976765359358
They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable." Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected.	8.130290665122896
Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred, during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both.	7.92520128478917
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention.	7.278186624190063
They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of every thing but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs.	8.077719414927044
Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs.	3.597046784153922
CHAPTER IV.	7.155281002419743
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane, on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third, her repining was over, and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere.	9.232163545664031
Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.	8.283832192767665
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves.	8.16637310617976
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence.	7.613358924418172
It was to this effect: "Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well.	6.788275332663973
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.	6.7791774214577005
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise.	8.51602143790363
To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.	8.590595825517104
I am very, very sorry.	8.21825953255557
So imprudent a match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.	8.487135122992026
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart.	7.133056934993351
His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.	7.694344668726557
Our poor mother is sadly grieved.	7.666452790864688
My father bears it better.	5.932458231054622
They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight.	7.05188367235516
The express was sent off directly.	5.678899554384149
My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us.	8.042269602571864
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon.	7.696772503165155
Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention.	9.910792152788552
I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother.	9.939106118960346
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written." Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter, instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.	8.666308113105565
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent.	9.405802651992088
Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.	8.955333103277308
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.	9.465986064873427
Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs.	5.423466083101516
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.	6.871941869306775
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F.	8.025439596366562
intending to trace their route.	9.448992256538551
He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.	6.061155380811625
All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.	7.548909146401846
I know not what to think.	6.17859190669217
After making every possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F.	8.545305068244794
came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such people had been seen to pass through.	7.7880444729055505
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.	7.584177382675989
but no one can throw any blame on them.	5.3350192800419185
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.	7.555972701062007
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible.	9.20194951099085
I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F.	6.591568807864144
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W.	9.579933239492037
was not a man to be trusted.	12.071310210254822
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room.	5.393369312676968
Could she exert herself it would be better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected.	8.297207557290063
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder.	7.3687008628096455
I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?	10.037087130847432
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient.	9.851393460185644
Adieu.	18.70742934517326
I take up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not, but circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here, as soon as possible.	7.768081599515251
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former.	8.843057822365182
What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.	8.04187069549554
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.	6.498039459552856
I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose." "Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute, but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs.	7.351565119236493
You are not well enough;--you cannot go yourself." Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them.	7.598727059075241
Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home, instantly.	7.270972269730772
Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill." "No, I thank you;" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself.	7.231915029234737
"There is nothing the matter with me.	5.021411908527809
I am quite well.	8.941796686801256
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn." She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word.	8.997891246192266
At length, she spoke again.	7.427989110139712
My youngest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham.	6.868639744931022
They are gone off together from Brighton.	8.721740783003211
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest.	7.60423784351585
She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever." Darcy was fixed in astonishment.	7.803536372697702
"When I consider," she added, in a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew what he was.	7.221555767058312
Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened.	8.675023851400374
But is it certain, absolutely certain?" "Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland." "And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?" "My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour.	7.904876016048231
But nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done.	8.414698491422017
How is such a man to be worked on?	12.723619969159456
How are they even to be discovered?	13.871877277303414
I have not the smallest hope.	9.526020534092252
It is every way horrible!" Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.	7.659845989301433
"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much.	8.203624204489573
Wretched, wretched, mistake!" Darcy made no answer.	5.106719078818166
Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it.	5.8181841030768355
Her power was sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace.	8.73547770348575
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her.	6.804110602605696
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.	7.849814509263362
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day." "Oh, yes.	6.669274434331986
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long." He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away.	7.987054230152954
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty.	7.960967446878151
But if otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment.	8.035400901355668
Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.	8.522930116853336
No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.	10.383149378644617
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared incomprehensible.	7.851970396227911
But now it was all too natural.	9.081643563603798
For such an attachment as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.	7.790430309549089
She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body.	8.764298169862471
Her affections had been continually fluctuating, but never without an object.	7.5850631934225445
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now feel it.	6.1061116657516825
She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience was severe.	8.668360007385283
Mr. and Mrs.	2.894456551441913
Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing, by the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs.	7.6205278244025685
Gardiner could not but be deeply affected.	7.278943098426554
"But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs.	7.399311341269936
_That_ is all settled." "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.	8.347818973926014
"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth! Oh, that I knew how it was!" But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.	8.129353788735997
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter.	8.432993644788361
It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.	8.577397520080543
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward?	13.192911603031327
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster?	11.104062031594221
His temptation is not adequate to the risk." "Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.	8.965659394986863
It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of it.	6.459560748137955
Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?" "Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest.	8.819168148048606
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable.	11.583408043904381
If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it.	7.459723637308729
They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose.	9.161876952578579
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland." "But why all this secrecy?	8.603485037004827
Why must their marriage be private?	8.15271872771155
Oh! no, no, this is not likely.	8.883834458973878
His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her.	7.129734427552068
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money.	10.56431715177201
He cannot afford it.	3.6455770561826584
But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.	8.765900844349407
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter." "But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?" "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt.	8.36198677738332
But, really, I know not what to say.	7.150495010966157
Perhaps I am not doing her justice.	8.177223686202353
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.	7.350971498755773
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers, have been in her head.	7.802844861987666
susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough.	7.811628868570473
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word.	9.829477929837573
That he has neither integrity nor honour.	11.143302097424222
Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.	12.859315547396394
"I do, indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring.	9.430909841681597
"I told you the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man, who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him.	7.4725208001341334
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless.	9.588046977760197
Yet he knew to the contrary himself.	8.471446411208998
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her." "But does Lydia know nothing of this?	7.7249022371868215
Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation, Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself.	8.357848778543552
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs.	6.4578361184386335
That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts." "When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other." "Not the slightest.	7.279406468201832
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family, on which it could be thrown away.	8.062766002170365
When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were.	9.039015971796916
Every girl in, or near Meryton, was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular attention, and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites." * * * * * It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey.	8.073399247519523
From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.	11.505543312357458
They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day.	6.492662015246627
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.	8.138102212415077
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.	8.916434155085318
"Not yet," replied Jane.	7.120038688465891
"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope every thing will be well." "Is my father in town?" "Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word." "And have you heard from him often?" "We have heard only once.	9.127577907945415
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do.	6.917544703166076
He merely added, that he should not write again, till he had something of importance to mention." "And my mother--How is she?	8.472727776666074
How are you all?" "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken.	9.21835342160961
She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.	7.483984047307176
She does not yet leave her dressing-room.	7.083003064541171
"You look pale.	13.823117438972874
How much you must have gone through!" Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.	7.731550996185348
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party.	8.11897497761046
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.	7.576856269971933
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give.	8.936063123345383
The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.	7.611804189506636
Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing.	7.676970180307647
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point of going to Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her.	7.255165992505297
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight?	9.473335912895935
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had been well looked after.	9.129544012635844
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am.	8.036398892576694
Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all?	8.265602198086315
The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do." They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.	8.15671822072196
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he, "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.	9.748982864671975
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton.	10.917027221676136
In a few days more, we may gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost.	9.13067562145762
Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for.	8.20730401754792
And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry.	7.613194624368022
And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.	7.624025736337167
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me, such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.	7.68481184210536
And tell my dear Lydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses.	8.753961288980761
Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all." But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.	9.48935214039869
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.	8.586700463612482
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their appearance before.	8.039135104640208
As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table, "This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.	8.852651512040545
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other, the balm of sisterly consolation." Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex." Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply.	8.05631299530231
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy.	9.144275496315283
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and every thing about it, which I have not already heard.	9.080269202401725
Give me farther particulars.	7.7177257097194945
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place?	10.169404659962177
They must have seen them together for ever." "Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.	8.570018633059911
I am so grieved for him.	5.802564129216823
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost.	8.907048082081358
He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey." "And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry?	8.201675261807965
Did he know of their intending to go off?	12.703559026376743
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?" "Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it.	7.133746402810168
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before." "And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?" "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.	9.032263041650927
Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter, she had prepared her for such a step.	8.425404084569678
She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks." "But not before they went to Brighton?" "No, I believe not." "And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself?	8.989295787210194
Does he know his real character?" "I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did.	8.21650292880883
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant.	8.910837142062588
We acted with the best intentions." "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?" "He brought it with him for us to see." Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.	8.512352522835018
These were the contents: "MY DEAR HARRIET, "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed.	9.778529684722477
I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.	8.300274945537643
I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off.	9.80560425380415
What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing.	12.04694891318957
Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.	6.178497870998809
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure.	9.321922478137708
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are packed up.	9.472372069419498
Good bye.	8.088409232368974
Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to our good journey.	7.5693831013102
"Your affectionate friend, "LYDIA BENNET." "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it.	7.343151536865317
"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.	8.60906142203468
But at least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.	9.430234730945365
My poor father! how he must have felt it!" "I never saw any one so shocked.	9.249686341912794
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes.	8.533729395817398
My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!" "Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it, who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?" "I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is very difficult.	8.071984480836804
My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen, almost took from me my faculties." "Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you.	7.870310341435353
You do not look well.	7.971124105125551
Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone." "Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.	7.047181055023378
Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on.	6.87030238926849
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me.	8.762643349175658
She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if they could be of use to us." "She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours.	8.362599883223988
Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied." She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.	7.4610300788233
It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be remarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham.	9.426314686962156
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach.	8.126861173447434
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed: but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this." CHAPTER VI.	9.184973271839075
His family knew him to be on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent, but at such a time, they had hoped for exertion.	7.2897874948474755
Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.	10.711445028857446
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.	8.524686810280901
Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up, though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.	6.882739184122074
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man, who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light.	6.457974521844172
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.	8.157189713036432
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and every body began to find out, that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness.	9.441681364963735
Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come, when if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.	8.19824587537073
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him; it told them, that on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street.	8.90230307856737
Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it.	8.42412725926441
He added, that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present, to leave London, and promised to write again very soon.	7.755271755508916
There was also a postscript to this effect.	7.285842164140249
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections, who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself.	9.745333848996943
If there were any one, that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence.	8.331026061148302
At present we have nothing to guide us.	8.035748346970209
Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head.	8.884360629697127
But, on second thoughts, perhaps Lizzy could tell us, what relations he has now living, better than any other person." Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature, as the compliment deserved.	8.318535363754473
It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ----shire, might be able to give more information; and, though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.	8.048174111343782
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected.	8.415973385253189
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning's impatience.	12.23673441795963
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told, would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.	7.4685394958625455
It was as follows: "MY DEAR SIR, "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.	8.162493247099192
Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs.	4.725161641989928
No arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind.	7.622201147802077
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.	7.228379375447659
And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs.	7.232536846345737
Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs.	7.900679599901168
Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.	9.675274510942238
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family.	7.88001206871228
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace.	7.178252693499243
Let me advise you then, my dear Sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.	8.524385455736024
"I am, dear Sir, &c.	6.783065237872453
&c." Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.	9.898458581184489
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation, with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living.	9.47611711214772
His former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them.	8.528663054351304
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out, as likely to give any news of him.	9.083775660012568
And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him, to a very considerable amount.	9.438995499189296
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton.	8.603655051863925
He owed a good deal in the town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.	8.916119152363587
Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family; Jane heard them with horror.	11.361670077868249
"A gamester!" she cried.	7.8438426816015046
"This is wholly unexpected.	10.673600439915738
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's intreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do, whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit.	9.014724870086415
When Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.	9.434214975866352
Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?" As Mrs.	7.800172918374856
Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and her children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.	6.719374682764021
The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.	7.5751970914564675
Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.	7.659046823450963
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.	6.825995703994111
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.	7.976775448051751
Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from Pemberley.	8.139367138262338
It would have spared her, she thought, one sleepless night out of two.	8.94895039502402
When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure.	9.33008399762406
It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that.	8.376884793318519
Who should suffer but myself?	8.902405210350777
"You may well warn me against such an evil.	10.676533611201648
Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.	8.903559654721352
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.	12.402617779619916
It will pass away soon enough." "Do you suppose them to be in London?" "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?" "And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.	8.321216612265507
No officer is ever to enter my house again, nor even to pass through the village.	8.635978164345616
And you are never to stir out of doors, till you can prove, that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner." Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.	9.112854411603927
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy.	6.655141411993203
We have heard nothing from town." "Dear madam," cried Mrs.	6.6239377219894084
Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner?	10.340170201589245
He has been here this half hour, and master has had a letter." Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.	8.230576879906495
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room; from thence to the library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said, "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse." Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.	8.977730978524445
Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out, "Oh, Papa, what news?	7.566070232600139
what news?	10.490611181540087
have you heard from my uncle?" "Yes, I have had a letter from him by express." "Well, and what news does it bring?	8.93213125732885
good or bad?" "What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket; "but perhaps you would like to read it." Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.	8.640710873270201
"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is about." "Gracechurch-street, Monday, August 2.	5.994384783066616
"MY DEAR BROTHER, "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope will give you satisfaction.	8.168129305112856
The particulars, I reserve till we meet.	9.52262707597
All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum.	7.774033726829809
These are conditions, which, considering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you.	6.6793489805609845
I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer.	7.345292022835744
If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement.	7.180307410412669
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.	9.242807840080047
We have judged it best, that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve.	10.485476649225392
She comes to us to-day.	4.5537658728840995
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on.	8.700402544415695
Your's, &c.	4.7902033458392275
"EDW.	9.416879382657287
GARDINER." "Is it possible!" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished.	9.919010969505024
"Can it be possible that he will marry her?" "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him;" said her sister.	8.323830169452599
"My dear father, I congratulate you." "And have you answered the letter?" said Elizabeth.	7.420605403591992
"No; but it must be done soon." Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.	11.596846144890282
Consider how important every moment is, in such a case." "Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself." "I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done." And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.	7.2433584475088315
"And may I ask?" said Elizabeth, "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with." "Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little." "And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!" "Yes, yes, they must marry.	8.15817541167773
There is nothing else to be done.	9.630863328597032
But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is, how much money your uncle has laid down, to bring it about; and the other, how I am ever to pay him." "Money! my uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, Sir?" "I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone." "That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before.	8.690487292399887
His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself.	8.334491154773096
A small sum could not do all this." "No," said her father, "Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.	6.9265357653393576
Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.	6.333244461760508
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.	9.026392513808208
"How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.	9.419495113504285
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or any thing like it, has been advanced.	9.046934225490636
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?" "If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own.	8.743057021455842
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited.	9.609156665646978
Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage, as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge.	8.399097127601516
By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!" "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy.	8.69740412483851
Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten." "Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget.	7.324334343178148
It is useless to talk of it." It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.	9.205111248898994
He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied, "Just as you please." "May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?" "Take whatever you like, and get away." Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together.	8.5267308498171
After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud.	7.849703001702413
Bennet could hardly contain herself.	7.174847347520624
As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance.	9.315953055511084
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation.	7.2949616384181235
To know that her daughter would be married was enough.	8.723505560534726
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.	13.136422565608315
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried: "This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage every thing.	8.729418240210794
How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly.	9.005283860439919
Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her.	7.680031147000004
Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill.	8.10073835106978
I will put on my things in a moment.	10.272210345151109
My dear, dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!" Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.	10.090499515163126
If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him, except a few presents.	8.896963679922061
Well! I am so happy.	7.768585939825976
In a short time, I shall have a daughter married.	10.339367979260668
Wickham! How well it sounds.	8.765806919847378
And she was only sixteen last June.	10.106675166701317
My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me.	7.609808270931352
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately." She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted.	8.56169983658494
One day's delay she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite so obstinate as usual.	8.49380615092177
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips.	7.997204938579434
And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs.	6.933511784524346
Long.	14.848096511074402
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure.	6.487447500528262
Girls, can I do any thing for you in Meryton?	10.584241144457016
Oh! here comes Hill.	10.180737494582829
My dear Hill, have you heard the good news?	10.531745267025638
Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding." Mrs.	7.278181158231276
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.	7.75921812329733
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful.	9.315336429578032
She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity, could be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.	8.54353504988052
Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him.	7.782885294121073
Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her.	7.135012402986568
He was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any one, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.	8.096855499734922
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless; for, of course, they were to have a son.	7.745845367836737
This son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for.	6.179585464506057
Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.	6.3450149606838595
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would.	11.662828099205175
This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving.	8.879789148939544
Bennet and the children.	12.311799990195954
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter, depended on the will of the parents.	8.777896361448438
This was one point, with regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him.	8.043024633595445
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him.	6.802883440181883
He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present arrangement.	9.030462360286293
He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her, through her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within that sum.	7.572174916692949
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present, was to have as little trouble in the business as possible.	7.9870080657539395
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence.	9.065168581307033
The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood.	7.263788524167917
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farm house.	7.6482662349829775
Bennet had been down stairs, but on this happy day, she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high.	9.448764433833222
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph.	7.596472788761997
The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants.	8.013126130443654
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.	7.642090936033936
But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, "Mrs.	5.44792048529553
Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding.	9.561887602791353
Into _one_ house in this neighbourhood, they shall never have admittance.	10.39005411612117
I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn." A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs.	7.345429044445605
Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter.	6.923756283223637
Bennet could hardly comprehend it.	5.564851014225487
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment, as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe possible.	7.014723349540298
She was more alive to the disgrace, which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham, a fortnight before they took place.	9.14520254184176
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning, from all those who were not immediately on the spot.	9.556299867631886
She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means.	9.865575099513855
Not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.	6.501945047537396
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink.	12.989816599126684
The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this.	7.740695557831517
She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what.	9.496336320544707
She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it.	8.007206681210313
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex.	8.90567835136014
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her.	5.7873980950844714
His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes.	9.000250705414551
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved, and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.	9.113990704999777
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was.	5.6391106964205315
An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.	8.031779437641918
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine.	8.792524285514373
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.	7.574610369937086
* * * * * Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother.	7.987119670678034
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on.	7.2400148545727
And I think you will agree with me, in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's.	7.3892649458524975
It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army.	9.002077061076866
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom.	13.13206726081892
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list, according to his information.	7.35626539651033
He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us.	8.58896059158853
They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.	6.756302535013924
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all, before she leaves the South.	9.557646855413228
"E.	9.566275459080392
GARDINER." Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do.	8.578710827354078
Bennet, was not so well pleased with it.	7.65199080204554
Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites.	9.700599101784594
"She is so fond of Mrs.	6.389070256504137
Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much.	7.157822615488588
The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s regiment." His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.	9.736244081116416
But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished.	8.783801490690673
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to the North.	9.695374495725758
When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn.	7.669977215599699
Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.	8.88834554231647
CHAPTER IX.	7.155281002419743
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself.	8.895403636813631
They came.	7.380641863791688
Smiles decked the face of Mrs.	2.932647837757894
Bennet, as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.	7.511693183189465
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room.	8.085732724366508
Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham, who followed his lady, and wished them both joy, with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.	8.062249806698564
The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him.	6.428553447239965
Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked.	12.56336866247069
Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless.	5.643734503202898
She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations, and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.	7.62210369987048
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all.	8.264365827503875
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man.	8.466609525616196
_She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.	6.671277920518548
There was no want of discourse.	12.99996833015626
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.	8.299408557653129
Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was." Her father lifted up his eyes.	9.56256029681058
Jane was distressed.	11.743138726743597
Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people here abouts know I am married to-day?	8.336750230050777
I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like any thing." Elizabeth could bear it no longer.	7.3767571218569
She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining-parlour.	8.575891708406102
Her ease and good spirits increased.	9.266054243393429
She longed to see Mrs.	4.684560915942409
Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs.	5.855648850571157
Wickham," by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs.	6.085599127647124
Hill and the two housemaids.	14.08926217111351
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband?	8.89613328346452
Is not he a charming man?	8.791571735854985
I am sure my sisters must all envy me.	5.922671365922964
I only hope they may have half my good luck.	8.815362926445934
That is the place to get husbands.	10.45807853547182
What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go." "Very true; and if I had my will, we should.	8.81354709270091
But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off.	10.879578244125423
I shall like it of all things.	10.504676857368112
You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.	6.826538892244784
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all." "I should like it beyond any thing!" said her mother.	7.4926336231148944
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over." "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands." Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.	8.592958209987792
Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.	9.351190949319033
No one but Mrs.	3.8794475205267784
Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.	8.945325895208198
These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.	6.230974592259051
Wickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him.	7.601053111842995
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him.	5.893070006887683
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him.	7.037615356288588
You were not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it.	5.858192692252518
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?" "No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject." "La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off.	9.275315514435194
We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish.	8.685567250001963
And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock.	7.608430847467071
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church.	9.175346612427601
Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted.	8.91531390352893
And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon.	8.31603363246695
However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham.	8.293633915340529
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.	12.221671326743481
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them.	6.632589915381949
If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight.	7.018257187402661
Not one party, or scheme, or any thing.	8.322362471536128
To be sure London was rather thin, but however the little Theatre was open.	8.416228869280088
Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone.	10.207160675661845
And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it.	6.8134607849450015
Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day.	9.22721137428942
But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set out.	9.789643015422651
However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well." "Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.	8.916779545793247
"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know.	5.928573173903193
But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it.	6.701726283398523
I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?	6.659144058185119
It was to be such a secret!" "If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject.	7.808318623197328
You may depend upon my seeking no further." "Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions." "Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry." On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.	7.7015815410283865
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information.	8.491850653045207
It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.	7.738076959569302
Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable.	8.288989462082329
She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.	8.581458676129861
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time.	7.623778304060217
Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance." "Not that I _shall_ though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out." Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.	8.66626224970726
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter, as soon as she possibly could.	8.279297573862811
She was no sooner in possession of it, than hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.	10.776166848332439
"Gracechurch-street, Sept.	6.564906724684106
6.	8.993593978210777
"MY DEAR NIECE, "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you.	6.504144772719033
I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.	10.53104447805816
If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence.	10.566028766413494
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed him to act as he has done.	9.759554557552876
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor.	11.383109715594678
Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours.	10.338689537194107
It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been.	7.5585598843054544
He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.	7.44390723241545
From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them.	8.878467470280313
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him, to lay his private actions open to the world.	7.600330929679916
His character was to speak for itself.	8.581798634270344
He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on by himself.	7.823567890368932
He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another reason for his resolving to follow us.	8.941507865759101
There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs.	6.104909696212019
She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings.	7.795462079453807
This Mrs.	2.4947842766914667
Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town.	7.9344530319653614
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted.	12.193914968657646
She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.	7.798116607675134
Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her.	6.903401653249707
At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction.	6.308769039026128
He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.	6.902916086215427
His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go.	8.47997908436685
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was.	6.430427436022067
Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt, had never been _his_ design.	7.205229653028723
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone.	9.559066567717334
He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.	6.848171667964045
He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.	9.332013618158518
Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once.	10.283100472481758
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage.	9.945492637360857
But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.	7.687662106949665
Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.	7.80414019814526
They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.	10.427350848870873
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.	9.965615778289369
Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch-street the evening before I came home.	7.1373478629248295
But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning.	7.782395630849452
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him, till after the departure of the former.	9.117119452149826
On Saturday he came again.	6.21829707754084
Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.	6.761571870381702
They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too.	8.50059978777645
It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn.	6.371485756465745
But our visitor was very obstinate.	9.613879134060381
I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all.	8.586802322951007
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.	9.410394329157107
They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved.	7.989648850298684
But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.	8.584389010673899
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.	8.605915545719904
His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased.	8.054744796063142
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above.	9.638901713339909
It was owing to him, to his reserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was.	8.580117744184376
Perhaps there was some truth in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve, can be answerable for the event.	9.20775265594471
But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another interest_ in the affair.	8.853084422202102
When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.	9.558403144551797
I believe I have now told you every thing.	7.950899870421199
Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house.	7.2432199747995965
_He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no fresh pain.	8.847237767971663
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family.	9.261199028860347
If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen.	8.490167695507438
I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.	6.380775930113888
Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding.	8.619272785016896
He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday.	7.608429477160588
Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him.	8.096725071808956
His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.	7.7994936572655815
His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him.	7.0780702400712565
I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name.	7.099342851322974
But slyness seems the fashion.	5.1919129477620505
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park.	9.87860209215087
A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.	5.889024968414428
But I must write no more.	10.337338609524336
The children have been wanting me this half hour.	8.045540706941013
Your's, very sincerely, "M.	10.565021177348955
GARDINER." The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share.	8.678887583725352
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce.	8.29449266540396
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem.	10.441870404658106
Her heart did whisper, that he had done it for her.	5.567412912700079
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham.	7.923865001855168
Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection.	7.787699408708116
He had to be sure done much.	8.089914299150074
She was ashamed to think how much.	9.126862826617716
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe, that remaining partiality for her, might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned.	9.289164433336087
It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return.	10.048178547970338
Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him.	8.367274344688969
For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him.	7.19446236425884
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.	7.245501238011959
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again.	7.702864181291626
It was hardly enough; but it pleased her.	7.4798420950603886
She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.	8.24698535135725
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.	9.948870931568184
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.	6.547965508039226
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome." "I should be sorry indeed, if it were.	9.206661825854201
_We_ were always good friends; and now we are better." "True.	8.906740677211694
Are the others coming out?" "I do not know.	6.564084770495518
Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton.	8.138128185144739
And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley." She replied in the affirmative.	8.81259356727384
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.	10.704911609883274
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose?	11.209380742474403
Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me.	5.8290597206963835
But of course she did not mention my name to you." "Yes, she did." "And what did she say?" "That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well.	7.317149033720739
At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented." "Certainly," he replied, biting his lips.	6.785522287463662
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said, "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.	8.992651603029122
I wonder what he can be doing there." "Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth.	8.050470938813865
"It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year." "Undoubtedly.	9.504232033792878
Did you see him while you were at Lambton?	14.671235504951627
When I last saw her, she was not very promising.	8.566378441551235
I am very glad you liked her.	5.990112526969774
I hope she will turn out well." "I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age." "Did you go by the village of Kympton?" "I do not recollect that we did." "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.	8.529730934332333
I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.	9.869489247634304
One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be.	7.951365357415711
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?" "I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron." "You have.	7.366021831753985
You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it." They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile, "Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.	8.492320355990797
Do not let us quarrel about the past.	12.53445318438223
In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind." She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.	8.182306211419142
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.	9.392940499263313
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs.	5.395085569325567
Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.	8.628941266822528
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?" "Oh, lord! I don't know.	7.20645811711016
But you know married women have never much time for writing.	9.994175295809155
They will have nothing else to do." Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's.	8.0624243784744
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw.	6.981082145313056
He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all.	8.254370867400196
I am prodigiously proud of him.	6.802995027863719
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself, to produce a more valuable son-in-law." The loss of her daughter made Mrs.	7.234781039867121
Bennet very dull for several days.	6.850261888624992
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends.	7.45955345788833
"It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single." "It is no such thing.	7.833057229738829
Lydia does not leave me because she is married; but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off.	10.272312084984659
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks.	8.688632911125127
Bennet was quite in the fidgets.	17.06958857556768
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.	5.686839890658364
Philips first brought her the news.) "Well, so much the better.	4.599553642695014
Not that I care about it, though.	9.581028753072488
He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure _I_ never want to see him again.	7.823998051762668
But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it.	7.78372088416635
And who knows what _may_ happen?	8.236316094305087
But that is nothing to us.	7.527516706620259
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.	6.756795239793879
He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday.	8.021894514187434
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said, "I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed.	8.80104787767565
But don't imagine it was from any silly cause.	7.552726461073219
I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at.	10.756248722832211
I do assure you, that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain.	8.957632191896305
I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him.	8.266074439547646
Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks." Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.	7.513308255675052
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.	9.092846788672658
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself." In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it.	8.707998005587676
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.	7.263543295202108
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs.	6.248314299908701
Bennet, "you will wait on him of course." "No, no.	7.486984511478754
You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters.	8.871032110889118
But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again." His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.	9.129866672766694
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he.	5.024122480604897
He knows where we live.	9.586894740274545
But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined.	11.152602155400741
We must have Mrs.	4.71777054898332
Long and the Gouldings soon.	9.134106916179887
As the day of his arrival drew near, "I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister.	8.838504945445198
"It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of.	8.910667254811207
Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!" "I wish I could say any thing to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power.	7.9544955270433375
You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much." Mr. Bingley arrived.	9.465746079941015
Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side, might be as long as it could.	7.153675291036122
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before.	6.235007986758558
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock, and ride towards the house.	8.625508692731175
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy.	6.937464152994436
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?" "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know." "La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before.	7.566572386434166
Mr. what's his name.	6.8629074092340705
That tall, proud man." "Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow.	6.304766184160656
Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him." Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.	8.70956664866596
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter.	8.575299235843605
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough.	6.510983320032573
Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.	7.175590376417727
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.	7.101635309566097
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as what Jane felt for Bingley.	8.170638223380259
Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.	7.983973240547383
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation." She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister, as the servant was approaching the door.	7.260432668282748
Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected.	7.369595522636047
On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.	8.876309448171133
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command.	9.21434667168852
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy.	8.144925354448194
But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt.	9.157107569305959
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed.	7.829212603640902
He was received by Mrs.	5.260719726412535
Bennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.	8.40655042570302
Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.	8.67812362997676
Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.	8.192880194207964
More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please than when they last met, were plainly expressed.	8.444185272166601
She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.	9.146163972141716
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she.	7.22315506640588
"Yet why did he come?" She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.	7.883578047549977
She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.	7.268043700293712
Bennet.	8.17122241068897
He readily agreed to it.	3.625797205686253
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again.	11.712653102576908
People _did_ say, you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true.	8.066632039961899
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away.	6.823723992584055
Miss Lucas is married and settled.	5.709875570236801
And one of my own daughters.	10.104799249662527
It was in the Times and the Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be.	9.444111729821454
It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq.	8.586257633061932
to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.	8.27548835594367
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it.	8.920766609337715
Did you see it?" Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations.	8.239460216070002
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes.	5.981053449075954
How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.	7.458495611822308
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me.	6.839644884797231
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not know how long.	8.41891825445158
His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.	9.024944126143351
Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves." Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.	9.40932654524701
It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present.	8.301004506784173
A few weeks, he believed.	10.38769828094585
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr. Bennet's manor.	8.592972814739934
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you." Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion.	8.174328264955241
At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion.	9.250646912665418
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them.	6.862812612201475
Their society can afford no pleasure, that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!" Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover.	8.137339934730415
When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention.	8.299356815815868
Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever.	9.321289529043865
But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.	9.65032731407584
Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.	9.445613107017682
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned.	8.303946290769666
I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement." Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business.	8.774656145874696
They then went away.	5.549811763628535
Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a man, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a-year.	8.301918210392827
Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.	6.242170975709218
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?" She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.	7.8926430922389725
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me?	8.858003502407563
If he fears me, why come hither?	12.17014347538486
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy.	6.120595769352359
I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming.	11.26592663768797
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday.	9.04114698889102
It will then be publicly seen, that on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance." "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly.	7.373544331131051
"Oh, Jane, take care." "My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now." "I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever." * * * * * They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.	7.227947952933509
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.	9.795961044344503
When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister.	7.568885692662504
Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself.	6.638161948575251
On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided.	9.697534607128608
He placed himself by her.	3.630207339782955
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.	6.825483294279652
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.	7.7441359849815266
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.	7.219151032022699
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour.	7.8988423559518095
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour.	9.07662286073076
Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table could divide them.	6.742412849548445
He was on one side of her mother.	8.517831875475911
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage.	8.974794824362283
Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.	8.228721802661857
Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her uncivil.	8.67510335634889
She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.	10.042625661091067
"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for ever." The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her, which would admit of a chair.	8.069270572554556
We want none of them; do we?" Darcy had walked away to another part of the room.	7.2122985938225685
Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?	11.148289310064007
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!" She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying, "Is your sister at Pemberley still?" "Yes, she will remain there till Christmas." "And quite alone?	8.559154516799484
Have all her friends left her?" "Mrs.	5.702425612150141
Annesley is with her.	3.3224613137358965
He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.	8.613506643494114
When the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party.	8.053506037315186
She now lost every expectation of pleasure.	5.342352046436803
Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.	7.19985224796751
"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day?	8.7607752097584
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you.	7.290129428320999
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw.	8.916397738393593
The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat a haunch.	7.381233889482192
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least.	8.441582117595155
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty.	7.848050735990469
Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not.	6.218051518405241
And what do you think she said besides?	13.449155870701942
'Ah! Mrs.	3.303907312317967
Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed.	9.192513390572229
I do think Mrs.	5.009792325169903
Long is as good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously." Mrs.	6.886550186503762
Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.	8.9290473843955
"The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other.	8.523194868069771
I hope we may often meet again." Elizabeth smiled.	10.58931503431285
You must not suspect me.	5.942046966498135
It mortifies me.	3.591338195712209
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it.	6.5132967603629215
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection.	8.941444639369337
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man." "You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment." "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!" "And how impossible in others!" "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?" "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.	8.496346137921952
We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.	8.837567064236312
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.	8.149261134949338
His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time.	7.442592861342588
He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits.	7.2075300086167635
Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.	8.40839143347056
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky." He should be particularly happy at any time, &c.	6.875067977615921
&c.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.	7.883106705383965
"Can you come to-morrow?" Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.	7.999331781250745
He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them dressed.	8.719414295926462
In ran Mrs.	2.793847967349249
Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.	7.649950226628327
He is come--Mr. Bingley is come.--He is, indeed.	7.564933968969936
Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown.	8.201630878385705
Come be quick, be quick! where is your sash my dear?" But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.	8.738989317752049
The same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the evening.	7.946754944701787
After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument.	8.015023785628486
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs.	4.379142140448907
What do you keep winking at me for?	8.887851455859595
I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room.	8.466365330174954
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.	7.404674444511544
In a few minutes, Mrs.	4.195702521235039
Bennet half opened the door and called out, "Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you." Elizabeth was forced to go.	6.21065346238787
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother as soon as she was in the hall.	8.688369089653348
"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing-room." Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.	7.650144637950155
Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual.	12.359846411215836
Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter.	6.75498326663248
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.	7.99084484294349
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.	6.051705270535866
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.	9.638245399921905
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference.	9.634577070818894
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time.	7.826075304187407
Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.	11.07067303783563
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected.	8.803448019000829
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him.	7.139169526618474
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs.	7.401461091238517
Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter.	9.15455089677794
Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.	9.689313032373528
On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would have told it all.	7.41860254841585
Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.	7.309899540463548
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much.	5.818379834151656
I do not deserve it.	6.230634155687501
Oh! why is not every body as happy?" Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express.	9.932602622757367
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane.	6.575996144987649
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said, for the present.	8.348564778460423
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried.	9.932648942717869
He is gone to my father already.	13.247519960137113
Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!" She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.	9.129558333273094
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.	7.451710852835949
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!" In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.	8.37052208254878
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.	8.401830845641914
"With my mother up stairs.	7.307325808610181
She will be down in a moment I dare say." He then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister.	7.553266926570921
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship.	8.9018872746598
They shook hands with great cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.	7.237430477680601
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever.	8.729894953970863
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter and said, "Jane, I congratulate you.	7.3907269855491196
You will be a very happy woman." Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.	10.03841658971121
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled.	8.250261584464461
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together.	9.327193307398511
Your tempers are by no means unlike.	8.332896197343604
You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income." "I hope not so.	7.6412423376042815
Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night.	7.231335413241195
I always said it must be so, at last.	6.94441452228621
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together.	9.12639998125247
Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!" Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten.	8.588441207962681
At that moment, she cared for no other.	7.71198873200898
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.	9.752882720685546
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.	9.216199920815095
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought himself obliged to accept.	7.696083152328136
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.	9.758201536795363
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me, that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible." "I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth.	7.879450601802777
"But how did he account for it?" "It must have been his sister's doing.	10.048009641185262
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects.	9.641716417197927
But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other." "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter.	8.66582268861755
Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard." "Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!" "He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty." This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities.	9.064331604348117
Elizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.	7.437046162900508
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane.	8.825377321375722
"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but such another man for you!" "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you.	8.657333421198343
Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness.	9.374283790921016
No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time." The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret.	7.889292817012139
Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.	5.4090923352684275
Philips, and _she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.	8.443197907161391
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.	9.24930135238258
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn.	8.862714890991287
It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours.	11.117659157069856
The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them.	6.453014995500793
They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open, and their visitor entered.	8.071674402215622
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.	9.072443121385035
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.	9.314127463766823
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.	9.793603807099794
After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, "I hope you are well, Miss Bennet.	6.665700648465812
That lady I suppose is your mother." Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.	6.123649062749596
"She is my youngest girl but one.	7.649881410146741
My youngest of all, is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man, who I believe will soon become a part of the family." "You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.	7.518846415974911
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's." "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west." Mrs.	7.4882760274572835
Collins well." "Yes, very well.	5.384802882552582
I saw them the night before last." Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling.	9.209096141071416
But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.	8.449949761566588
Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth, "Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn.	8.153630983010043
I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company." "Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and shew her ladyship about the different walks.	8.35722185658012
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage." Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest down stairs.	9.948437616797548
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it.	5.7732364455948115
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.	8.574990588044482
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.	8.47464398842695
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:-- "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.	8.865182782171168
Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come." Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.	7.649893083095984
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here." "Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with.	7.9708409026838805
But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so.	6.312053136778126
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.	5.99753282764364
A report of a most alarming nature, reached me two days ago.	7.4578790960290355
I was told, that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that _you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy.	7.563433912379457
Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you." "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.	8.139313537445323
What could your ladyship propose by it?" "At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted." "Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth, coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence." "If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it?	7.853681319101906
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves?	9.066437148617378
_You_ may ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer." "This is not to be borne.	8.940600127158065
Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied.	9.284637716584418
But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family.	6.130636019289183
You may have drawn him in." "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it." "Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?	7.790440852990862
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns." "But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit." "Let me be rightly understood.	7.4186426680475055
This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.	6.074512039550499
No, never.	13.107319240398203
Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_.	10.004489317830032
Now what have you to say?" "Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me." Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied, "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.	9.111367099888943
It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of her's.	6.951421744361369
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh?	9.006821082788209
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy?	9.356714208713042
Have you not heard me say, that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?" "Yes, and I had heard it before.	7.669662432150674
But what is that to me?	7.997491419160404
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh.	10.139286790401346
You both did as much as you could, in planning the marriage.	6.499772647233538
Its completion depended on others.	5.157132461854128
If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?	7.92650808486596
And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?" "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.	5.120117012515812
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.	9.417232285435931
You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.	7.020761953845254
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us." "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth.	7.308496007718695
"But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine." "Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring?	8.179137014506926
Is nothing due to me on that score?	10.23175451865039
You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it.	5.907316031103551
I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.	13.458068981628173
Hear me in silence.	8.221580323280316
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other.	6.655959920546419
They are descended on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient, though untitled families.	8.984033462769288
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune.	9.452548702469832
Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be.	7.743347590387706
If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up." "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.	8.964435592578889
He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal." "True.	9.993672695135743
You _are_ a gentleman's daughter.	6.505794251141573
But who was your mother?	12.341004325432733
Who are your uncles and aunts?	6.714913751920294
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition." "Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_." "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?" Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation, "I am not." Lady Catherine seemed pleased.	8.534294581105799
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?" "I will make no promise of the kind." "Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished.	8.65243973621904
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman.	8.403367802655199
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede.	12.273015434266467
I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require." "And I certainly _never_ shall give it.	7.350435912735738
Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make _their_ marriage at all more probable?	7.25045824231207
Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?	9.605518028998183
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged.	7.677109427573838
You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.	9.29714641291134
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine.	8.097184280010833
I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject." "Not so hasty, if you please.	8.06251587267228
To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add.	9.12130398238011
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.	11.830411324894897
I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles.	8.920699659447152
And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister?	9.420146332264585
Is _her_ husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother?	8.846836016086405
Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking?	7.974528898027653
Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back.	10.532997288892743
Her ladyship was highly incensed.	8.643678192661094
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say.	7.502929079641311
You know my sentiments." "You are then resolved to have him?" "I have said no such thing.	7.127139954051587
You refuse, then, to oblige me.	5.298460214016329
You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude.	5.492098543914442
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world." "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.	8.835440232270445
No principle of either, would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy.	5.91512300745417
I shall now know how to act.	10.581482665298626
Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified.	8.49147481412321
I hoped to find you reasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point." In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.	8.549047590435197
I send no compliments to your mother.	5.995553433810552
You deserve no such attention.	6.492778275451031
I am most seriously displeased." Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself.	7.396747265260358
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs.	7.813179438932219
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.	8.272002497297066
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go." "She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.	7.7342833784274205
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?" Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.	8.857837406915472
CHAPTER XV.	7.155281002419743
Lady Catherine it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy.	6.641680284930343
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together.	7.256755696308193
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only set _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible, at some future time.	6.740175793226369
In revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference.	8.954805532730527
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce.	9.44457715692466
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side.	8.38337802886926
If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity unblemished could make him.	8.074271750607581
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.	8.334137895559653
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it.	6.749761130200716
Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject.	8.078997820762595
The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.	10.533710680420375
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room." She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held.	8.229451854644255
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down.	8.503260920293103
As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents.	9.079157751160968
I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink of matrimony.	9.360504512142423
Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest." The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued, "You look conscious.	10.040540589930552
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer.	8.84349357665158
This letter is from Mr. Collins." "From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?" "Something very much to the purpose of course.	8.202838611937105
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.	7.709659328603213
I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point.	9.484134454228846
What relates to yourself, is as follows.	7.1375812933525005
"Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs.	3.736483828771871
Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority.	10.377582724807384
Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land." "Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" "This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage.	7.656537069100788
We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye." "_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you.	8.224784975839603
Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!" Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.	9.611614998457398
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.	5.618377339977948
"Are you not diverted?" "Oh! yes.	7.501445390222753
Pray read on." "After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match.	8.468124088382561
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned." "Mr. Collins moreover adds," "I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known.	8.543768583215575
But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.	7.910647812397609
You are not going to be _Missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report.	11.76393102585922
For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?" "Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted.	8.479794618406624
But it is so strange!" "Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing.	9.023304036631668
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration.	9.327113774072357
Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law.	7.151964492274602
And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report?	8.549899764022445
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not.	9.023757225696107
It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried.	9.809186606739557
Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_.	8.789456572836755
CHAPTER XVI.	7.155281002419743
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit.	8.082670702100755
Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out.	8.696048605677136
It was agreed to.	9.050264934314722
Bennet was not in the habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five set off together.	7.441785096334615
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them.	5.222069528755776
They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy, were to entertain each other.	6.287121802576199
Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.	8.331626816830054
Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it.	6.951443217370671
I did not think Mrs.	5.251759168541538
Gardiner was so little to be trusted." "You must not blame my aunt.	9.320636204194724
Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars.	8.710991287445113
That the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny.	9.400307303985977
But your _family_ owe me nothing.	5.020711824394497
Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought only of _you_." Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.	8.21408496772647
After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me.	6.898453916670706
If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once.	7.13140468673629
_My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever." Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances.	7.560655352954261
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.	7.717331435598573
They walked on, without knowing in what direction.	8.721240097998077
There was too much to be thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.	10.391110358307703
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew, which _she_ had refused to give.	8.027926642395526
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.	7.459020305984601
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly." Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_.	7.827864121108638
After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations." "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?	8.678672177914237
It was unpardonable.	19.030501794699273
I cannot think of it without abhorrence." "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth.	8.316152371785416
"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility." "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself.	8.118282038944363
The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me.	6.8456893626876285
Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words.	7.1530457286428115
You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice." "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression.	8.000102942726851
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way." "I can easily believe it.	7.28630392949844
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did.	6.61877281668847
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me." "Oh! do not repeat what I then said.	8.850256154355428
I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it." Darcy mentioned his letter.	6.514467340901097
"Did it," said he, "did it _soon_ make you think better of me?	6.599147055204216
Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?" She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.	9.34012158045297
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary.	7.90785320443627
I hope you have destroyed the letter.	8.024756968316096
There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again.	7.6366945029743025
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me." "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies." "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit." "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.	7.740894951402213
The adieu is charity itself.	5.5307702690366645
But think no more of the letter.	6.161401706373965
The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten.	8.93377036083879
You must learn some of my philosophy.	14.54734419993506
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure." "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind.	7.465561588873009
But with _me_, it is not so.	5.600046442656046
Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled.	9.155567057450904
I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle.	10.164910477074686
As a child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper.	7.123150867255111
I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.	9.888778839816498
Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_) I was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to _wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own.	7.678456304128309
Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.	6.332529719989285
By you, I was properly humbled.	8.732131680244501
I came to you without a doubt of my reception.	10.494526323686028
What will you think of my vanity?	14.408384664108944
I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.	8.293740084032155
How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?" "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction." "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley.	8.4169153332539
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due." "My object _then_," replied Darcy, "was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to.	8.03420132131234
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you." He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.	8.372976566876662
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.	7.672818088314193
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know any thing about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.	7.6726987798773125
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs.	6.744022083247031
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.	7.989697880950519
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.	8.796196148292292
"On the evening before my going to London," said he "I made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.	7.808264917443858
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs, absurd and impertinent.	7.99747513297216
His surprise was great.	6.174912481347563
I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together." Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.	8.151317519489048
"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?" "From the former.	8.530795082995793
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection." "And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him." "It did.	7.595515143493775
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest.	9.111181496391286
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine, made every thing easy.	7.72403848524541
I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him.	6.46441356353034
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him.	8.315982100773843
He was angry.	13.051530614819642
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation till they reached the house.	7.369099864207259
In the hall they parted.	11.704393988065805
CHAPTER XVII.	7.155281002419743
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table.	9.697997388588147
She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge.	10.200460302277614
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.	5.517362552951801
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy, than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her.	6.313501434677557
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.	8.94719719207341
At night she opened her heart to Jane.	4.574677711604453
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.	8.849712636188565
"You are joking, Lizzy.	7.219463258961684
This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me.	7.315120362627402
I know it to be impossible." "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.	7.857200836914741
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest.	7.989639840496745
"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be.	7.096416739825595
I know how much you dislike him." "You know nothing of the matter.	8.962822199379092
_That_ is all to be forgot.	12.928119240059067
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.	9.968786492815797
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself." Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.	9.267819733683664
Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.	8.433563427505476
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane.	7.412110082394321
"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain?	8.728224579401793
forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?" "There can be no doubt of that.	9.458635219465132
It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world.	9.129868737303813
But are you pleased, Jane?	11.364758856300005
Shall you like to have such a brother?" "Very, very much.	7.681581928221983
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight.	6.311823945444182
And do you really love him quite well enough?	13.142511525033548
Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than marry without affection.	10.231753818501922
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?" "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all." "What do you mean?" "Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley.	8.985566270155992
I am afraid you will be angry." "My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious.	10.103742562094968
Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay.	8.791046516666913
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?" "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.	9.13261739696913
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment.	8.467380943677105
When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.	8.126564770402497
I always had a value for him.	5.803739281613733
Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me.	7.457236179356593
But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me.	6.234723520150981
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it, to another, not to you." Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.	7.757176080914027
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.	9.343610345816396
But now she would no longer conceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage.	7.8570201080576565
All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.	7.505843317457039
* * * * * "Good gracious!" cried Mrs.	4.5209195943264735
Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here?	8.282235188314754
I had no notion but he would go a shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company.	8.520795341060712
What shall we do with him?	8.648961297644435
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way." Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.	9.482908556000861
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?" "I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs.	7.0660532343069455
Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning.	5.807459526009131
It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view." "It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.	7.7290714835679415
Wont it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.	9.63153742633837
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented.	9.831422944085746
So, do not put yourself to inconvenience." During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening.	9.768759564808326
She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man.	8.8372165658491
But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.	9.928535825605765
She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile.	8.426123182447887
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.	9.413135186172612
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.	9.52532754010975
Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man?	11.860759746420937
Have not you always hated him?" How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.	8.700825262702688
He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.	6.377238096013212
But will they make you happy?" "Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?" "None at all.	7.203370798874483
We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him." "I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.	7.283849134830005
Indeed he has no improper pride.	8.335930650421904
He is perfectly amiable.	11.480718622919802
You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms." "Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent.	8.034228510763956
He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he condescended to ask.	8.94988386135616
I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on having him.	8.203729615240848
But let me advise you to think better of it.	6.169218899275787
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior.	8.373423026470872
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.	7.470491376324097
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery.	6.547847327560095
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to respect your partner in life.	6.874784151457489
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say.	5.920413554309553
If this be the case, he deserves you.	6.593597035659348
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy." To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.	7.846764178732868
He heard her with astonishment.	7.674182862916482
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better.	7.051394974407718
It will save me a world of trouble and economy.	7.734910076533835
Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way.	7.198554845226764
I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter." He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure." Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure.	8.895581227360246
Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs.	5.659114136311145
Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable.	7.725599035985581
Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them.	8.122546683973061
She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.	7.176728987145086
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true?	9.08391657123752
Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all.	7.569275877809765
I am so pleased--so happy.	8.69230994398764
Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before.	8.32638926262662
I hope he will overlook it.	5.503832648125605
Dear, dear Lizzy.	6.4603808557580455
A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me.	7.368077277038087
I shall go distracted." This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away.	9.33074634265284
But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.	8.20516604153114
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence.	6.989164657984754
But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow." This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for.	8.815423374087839
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs.	7.450839260116243
Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.	8.521198146105883
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.	8.832088890065226
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he.	7.44112219831824
"Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane's." CHAPTER XVIII.	8.465399812384495
"How could you begin?" said she.	6.4970373692347865
"I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?" "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation.	9.053111028720478
It is too long ago.	10.379096110988817
I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun." "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not.	8.564626184968906
Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?" "For the liveliness of your mind, I did." "You may as well call it impertinence at once.	7.6438482344773675
It was very little less.	15.472445490901015
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention.	6.7145728565802045
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone.	7.496116164826078
I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_.	10.198201564348624
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you.	7.404829151775316
There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.	9.317160252955123
To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love." "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?" "Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her?	8.979561410282951
But make a virtue of it by all means.	6.966163641994652
My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.	7.333117429661973
What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here?	8.30224277971512
Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?" "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement." "But I was embarrassed." "And so was I." "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner." "A man who had felt less, might." "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself.	8.953972102690644
I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.	8.915277399093556
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the subject?	8.36967696542238
This will never do." "You need not distress yourself.	8.421613703402404
The moral will be perfectly fair.	9.932619055907528
Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us, were the means of removing all my doubts.	9.72872167208718
My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing." "Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use.	7.9858880334077735
But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?	9.604347296514034
or had you intended any more serious consequence?" "My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me.	7.585970294646438
But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected." From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.	7.3160349830149025
Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows: "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write.	7.555425587449543
You supposed more than really existed.	9.42509680096788
But _now_ suppose as much as you chuse; give a loose to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err.	7.888858122541333
You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last.	9.116726913012123
I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes.	7.015068990025159
How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful.	9.251007795657834
We will go round the Park every day.	7.099511503220462
I am the happiest creature in the world.	6.700277260787081
I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, I laugh.	11.744010392885006
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world, that he can spare from me.	7.9688388768749405
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.	8.34561895524601
Your's, &c." Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine, was in a different style; and still different from either, was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply to his last.	7.045100136382013
"DEAR SIR, "I must trouble you once more for congratulations.	6.9650039827461345
Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy.	5.030278845040558
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.	7.061696529591861
He has more to give.	9.246165587588532
"Your's sincerely, &c." Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere.	9.07262267772954
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard.	9.196406147824598
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it.	6.112037087752738
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.	7.044484643599997
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident.	9.618857868603573
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over.	9.697672619060027
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband.	8.829527683849665
He bore it however with admirable calmness.	7.802280290570187
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.	6.722246521850096
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.	8.061825856482335
Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs.	7.898959651925824
Philips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.	9.53926926804643
CHAPTER XIX.	7.155281002419743
Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters.	6.567355802063019
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs.	3.538704628009919
Bingley and talked of Mrs.	5.454276298943608
Darcy may be guessed.	14.068281566240497
I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children, produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.	8.3820142128596
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do.	9.010091861084483
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.	10.737489426227993
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart.	7.546451723392321
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.	7.808479705209437
In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great.	7.596206787280403
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia, and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.	7.72080453201186
From the farther disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs.	6.367766833250405
Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.	7.5872902983308155
Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone.	9.331708208237222
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.	8.787932077914713
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters.	7.728764648738359
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished.	7.775846985547386
The letter was to this effect: "MY DEAR LIZZY, "I wish you joy.	7.380182134700513
It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.	8.961346645380873
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.	8.737889923799175
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.	6.791523712358406
"Yours, &c." As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.	7.442296491654296
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them.	7.696080012070273
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance towards discharging their bills.	8.389972771107526
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought.	9.081225617910874
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.	8.077237987890234
Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him farther in his profession.	9.115102002941779
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone.	8.201712004690714
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see.	9.996505471767863
They were able to love each other, even as well as they intended.	11.788734956022438
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.	7.7172582995185275
He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry.	7.597755634220884
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way.	7.06870943357484
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end.	7.880373897879145
But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.	8.496186818125993
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.	11.015589266795375
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.	8.278490909110811
